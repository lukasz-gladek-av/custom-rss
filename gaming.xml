		<p>Pathea Games has announced that the alpha playtest for My Time At Evershine will begin on October 24th, and it will be for those who pledged $35 or more to the Kickstarter campaign for the Steam PC version of the game. Steam keys are going to be going out on October 21st and redeemable through PledgeManager, with My Time At Evershine then being available to download on October 24th. The key that is being sent out is not for the full game, as a separate key for that will be sent when the game is ready to release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reveal Teaser| My Time at Evershine" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubgnFCW2m3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Those who have backed My Time At Evershine on Kickstarter but chose a console version are not eligible for the alpha playtest. However, that can be changed by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fill out the&nbsp;<b>[<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FM4qmMVsc6uVHAw1TA">Google Form here</a>]</b>&nbsp;to register your request. &nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>If you already selected Steam (PC) previously, you don’t need to fill out this form – unless you now want to switch from&nbsp;<b>Steam</b>&nbsp;(PC) to&nbsp;<b>console</b>&nbsp;instead.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>We’ll collect all responses and upload them to PledgeManager.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Once processed, you’ll receive a new invitation email to reopen your PledgeManager survey and select Steam. If you can’t find the invitation email, simply log back into PledgeManager to check your survey.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>The deadline for this first batch of console-to-PC requests is&nbsp;<b>October 22nd, 18:00 (UTC+8)</b>. That’s&nbsp;<b>03:00 AM PST / 06:00 AM EST / 12:00 PM CET.</b><wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Please double-check your selection when switching to Steam. Once your Steam key is assigned, your&nbsp;<b>Alpha platform</b>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<b>locked</b>&nbsp;and cannot be changed again.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>This round only covers&nbsp;<b>console-to-Steam switches for Alpha access.</b>&nbsp;Other cases – like switching between consoles or standard PC (non-Alpha) keys – will be handled later.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first round of keys being sent out for the My Time At Evershine alpha playtest, with this running until the game is released properly. If you do get into the playtest you will not be allowed to share any images, videos or thoughts about My Time At Evershine outside of the Pathea Games official channels.</p>

<p>Glen Schofield co-founded Sledgehammer Games and would later go on to become the CEO of Striking Distance Studios. But it’s at Sledgehammer where the director was able to flex his creative chops on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII.</p>



<p>Schofield left Sledgehammer in 2018, and new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-the-haunting-2025-unveiled-poster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> titles have appeared across multiple studios: Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard, the modern-day Modern Warfare Remakes, and new Black Ops games. The former Call of Duty director believes the quality of the games has diminished in recent years.</p>

<figure><figcaption>He masterminded Dead Space and several important CoD titles. Credit to Glen Schofield Official Instagram</figcaption></figure>



<p>“As a matter of fact, Modern Warfare 3 (his CoD directorial debut) was the last Call of Duty to win Action Game of the Year, and my other two games were nominated for it. But now, you know, you don’t see them.” Schofield said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-glen-schofields-plan-to-save-the-games-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>He was asked about the ‘Call of Duty machine’, and it operates now. The franchise continues to make ridiculous sums of money, but there’s constant criticism about the direction of games, their content, and many other issues.</p>



<p>The former director thinks that it hasn’t been the same since he left Sledgehammer and stopped having creative and directorial input into Call of Duty.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one selfish example, I hate doing this, but since I left&nbsp;Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, the last one [Modern Warfare 3 (2023)] was a 50. They still sell well. They just aren’t as good. They aren’t the same.&nbsp;Treyarch’s still really good but you know…I&nbsp;got lucky. I feel like I was at the heyday of EA during my time there. I mean, it was a who’s who working there. And then when I got to Activision, I made Modern Warfare 3 (2011).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schofield is currently enjoying a break after leaving Striking Distance Studios, following the unsuccessful launch of The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>Do you agree that Call of Duty games haven’t gotten near the level of 2011’s Modern Warfare 3? Can CoD ever get back to these glorious heights?

            <p>Former Call of Duty series lead Glen Schofield has expressed he's "immensely worried" at the state of the modern FPS series under Microsoft, in a recent interview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-call-of-duty-director-says-hes-immensely-worried-about-the-future-of-the-series-under-xbox/#google_vignette">Speaking to VGC</a>, discussed the future of Call of Duty, stating: "what's happening to Gears of War, where's Halo... you know what I mean? And you look at EA, you look at these big companies, and I'm like where's the Strike games? Where's this game? And there's so many that just fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, once you're assimilated by one of these companies, I think you take on some of their traits. The other thing is, I don't know, but I would imagine that the Call of Duty bonus system is out, and now you have theirs, and people are going to go 'that isn't that'."</p>

</figure>
<p>Further elaborating on his thoughts, Schofield mused on what he believes has caused the decrease in quality in recent Call of Duty games, laying the blame also on the absence of key developers. This includes himself.</p>
<p>"I hate doing this, but since I left Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, [Modern Warfare (2023)] was a 50. They still sell well. You know, that happens. You move. I always wonder 'why did you take that guy out, it's not going to work later', and very few times does that work.</p><p>"They just aren't as good. They aren't the same. Treyarch's still really good but you know... I feel like I got lucky. I feel like I was at the heyday of EA during my time there. I mean, it was a who's who working there. And then when I got to Activision, I made Modern Warfare 3 (2011).</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, Modern Warfare 3 was the last Call of Duty to win Action Game of the Year, and my other two games were nominated for it. But now, you know, you don't see them."</p>
<p>In recent years, Schofield has himself had mixed results when attempting to create great games. After joining Krafton in 2019, he and the team at Striking Distance created <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">The Callisto Protocol</a>. This spiritual successor to Dead Space - another series he worked on - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to meet sales targets</a>. Schofield ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance voluntarily in late 2023</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has clarified the reasoning for his departure from the series, stating he "did not walk away" but was asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, news emerged of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">Côté leaving Ubisoft following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios, which will develop future <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>.</p>
<p>In an internal memo, Vantage Studios CEO Christophe Derennes reportedly stated Côté had "his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future", while a statement from Ubisoft affirmed Côté had "chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p>

<p>Now, in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">LinkedIn</a>, Côté has clarified that while he was offered another role in the company, it did not "carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work [he] had been entrusted with".</p>
<p>"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin's Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté's post reads. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin's Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organisational structure.</p>
<p>"A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years."</p>
<p>Côté continued that he holds no resentment towards Ubisoft, which has "been [his] home for all [his] professional life".</p>
<p>"But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away," he said. "I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside."</p>
<p>Côté has left Ubisoft after almost two decades at the company, joining the Assassin's Creed team for Brotherhood before leading the series' future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft and Tencent announced Vantage Studios earlier this month</a>, which will now be responsible for the company's biggest franchises, such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six Siege.</p>

            <p>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield is "already making calls" to EA's new owners in the hope he can make Dead Space 4.</p>
<p>Schofield was executive producer on the first Dead Space game in 2008, and while he wasn't involved in its two follow-ups, he later developed the spiritual successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> at Striking Distance Studios in 2022.</p>
<p>He then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance in 2023 after the game flopped</a>, and it seems is now courting EA to make a new Dead Space game - though he's so far been unsuccessful, despite suggestions he could save the company millions of dollars.</p>

<p>"I went to [EA] recently and they're like no, we're not interested anymore," Schofield told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">IGN </a>in an interview at Gamescom Asia. "I said, I can get back the leadership team. I need the models from EA Motive [who built the Dead Space remake in 2023] and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they're like, 'no'."</p>
<p>Despite this rejection, Schofield has not been deterred. EA recently announced a proposed private acquisition, which has reignited Schofield's ambitions.</p>
<p>"I have quite a few ideas that I'm ready to go with and one of them is Dead Space 4," said Schofield. "The fact that EA just got bought, I think there's an opportunity. I'm already making calls."</p>
<p>"I don't know where EA's head is right now, I don't think they made money on [the Dead Space remake]," he continued. "Dead Space needs to be adapted to different mediums - movies, TV series, it would be great.</p>
<p>"But I am more optimistic [since the sale of EA], because somebody new could buy [the Dead Space IP]."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA is set to be privately acquired in a $55bn deal</a> by a group of investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, led by President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>As such, there's speculation less financially successful parts of the business could be sold to pay off a hefty debt EA will need to cover as part of the acquisition. Video game union workers have since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">launched a petition against the acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schofield posted on LinkedIn the games industry is "tough" after failing to obtain financial backing for his latest project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-hints-at-retiring-from-game-development-after-struggling-to-fund-latest-project">hinting he may have directed his last game</a>.</p>

		<p>Marvel has announced the first ever PvE mode for its free to play hero shooter Marvel Rivals, with this crossover being suitably in season. From October 23rd, a new Zombies mode inspired by Marvel Zombies will be released for Marvel Rivals, allowing players to team up and take on hordes of the undead until they become overwhelmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="First-Ever PvE Mode: Marvel Zombies I Announce Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xBptgEhiok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There are some limits to the Marvel Rivals Zombie mode such as the playable characters. Players will only be able to play as Thor, Jeff, Magik, The Punisher, or Blade. Eventually, after the hordes get dealt with you will face off against bosses Zombie Namor and The Queen of the Dead. Each playable hero will have a unique ability to deal with the zombie waves. Jeff will be able to charge through groups, Blade will be armed with a bouncing Moon Blade, Thor will be able to shock zombies in his Awakened state, and Magik has an unlimited Darkchild form.</p>

Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor).</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-to-itemization-monster-combat-and-progression-ahead-of-season-11.1327378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled a new Diablo IV PTR, version 2.5.0, which is testing major core changes to the game that should go live in Season 11. To start with, monster combat has been overhauled. Enemy AI and formations have been rebuilt to make Sanctuary more threatening, providing monsters with unique combat roles and adaptive tactics. Players will find less grouping, smarter targeting, and stronger affix synergy. Over 20 new monster affixes are being introduced. Moreover, Champions will form thematic packs, and Elite minions inherit leader affixes.</p>



<p>Blizzard also made significant tweaks to Tempering and Masterworking in an attempt to reduce RNG. For Tempering, Diablo IV players will now pick the affix directly from a recipe, removing the randomness involved. Only one tempered affix per item is allowed, though Tempering charges can be restored infinitely. As for Masterworking, it no longer increases affix rolls; instead, it increases item Quality (boosting base armor, damage, or resistances). Each Masterwork adds between two and five Quality levels (up to a maximum of 20). A “Capstone bonus” at max Quality upgrades a random affix into a Greater Affix, which is rerollable without losing Quality. Finally, non-unique items now have four base affixes, up from three.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new feature called Sanctification is also being added to the game. The Heavens have noticed the players' work against the Evils and are granting the adventurers a small amount of power. When Sanctifying an item, there's a chance it will:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gain bonus Legendary powers</li>



<li>Enhance or replace affixes</li>



<li>Add unique “Sanctification affixes”</li>



<li>Become indestructible</li>
</ul>



<p>There are two ways to obtain these power boosts: through Heavenly Anvils or Heavenly Sigils (the latter reserved for Torment‑tier items). Do note that once Sanctified, items cannot be modified further. As such, this is meant to be the very final upgrade you want to apply to an item.</p>



<p>Blizzard is also adding a whole new stat called Toughness, which summarizes the player's average defense against each damage type. Healing is being revamped: potions will be capped at 4, regardless of Renown. Each potion heals 35% instantly of total HP and regenerates every 30 seconds. Potion upgrades were removed and are now part of natural health scaling. Life on Hit returns as a potential affix, and other life‑sustain affixes have been buffed.</p>



<p>Season 11 will mark the return of the Lesser Evils to Diablo IV. Duriel, Belial, Andariel, and Azmodan will be invading endgame modes, each one targeting a specific mode:</p>



<ul>
<li>Duriel is in Helltide, which will now rain parasitic maggot reinforcements alongside the mode's signature meteors.</li>



<li>Belial Eyes will appear randomly within The Pit. Once destroyed, they will stun nearby enemies and summon a pack of Belial apparitions. If players destroy several Eyes, the final boss will be replaced by Belial himself. Killing the Lesser Evil grants an additional Glyph upgrade and reward.</li>



<li>Andariel is in Kurast Undercity, where players will find three new Undercity Tributes. Each boost Undercity rewards and guarantees Andariel spawns as the final boss. These specific Tributes also add Dungeon affixes to the Undercity run.</li>



<li>Azmodan stalks the Sanctuary open world as a formidable new World Boss appearing in multiple locations. This Lesser Evil can also be summoned at will from three Summoning Altars; each altar will invoke Azmodan with powers from one of the other three Lesser Evils.</li>
</ul>



<p>In Season 11, players will obtain Divine Gifts from the angel Hadriel. Each Divine Gift has three components: a reward, a Corrupted Gift, and a Purified Gift. When slotted, the Divine Gift activates the reward bonus associated with it, increasing the rewards for that specific Divine Gift. Corrupted Gifts make each related activity more difficult, but still grant the reward bonus on the Divine Gift. Purified gifts remove the negative effect, add a positive effect, and double the reward gained. Corrupted Gift slots unlock automatically. Players must progress through the Seasonal Reputation board to unlock the Purified Gift slots.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Diablo IV is also getting a new competitive dungeon challenge called The Tower. Each Tower run is  a multi‑floor timed dungeon (with a 10-minute limit) unlocked in Cerrigar. There will be random layouts, affixes, and Pylon buffs across four Shrine types. Adventurers must kill enemies or collect Orbs to fill a progress bar, which will spawn bosses. Completion records will appear on global Leaderboards subdivided by:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solo Classes</li>



<li>Party tiers (2‑4 players)</li>



<li>Normal / Hardcore</li>



<li>Platform filters</li>



<li>Clan/Friends views</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Renown is now permanent only in the Eternal Realm. Seasonal progression becomes Rank‑based. Each rank requires completing a Capstone Dungeon to advance. Rewards grant skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, and cosmetics.</p>



<p>Blizzard appears to be significantly updating the game in an effort to lure back some lapsed players ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next year's second expansion</a>. Whether they will succeed remains to be seen, but you can test this patch on the PTR between October 21 and October 28.</p>

			<p>KONAMI has confirmed in <a href="https://www.konami.com/videonews/movie_view.html?movie_url=6382868806112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new video report</a> posted on the publisher's official website (as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silent-hill-2-remake-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Gematsu</a>) that the Silent Hill 2 remake has now surpassed two and a half million units sold. Meanwhile, the series as a whole has finally surpassed ten million units sold to date.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had reached two million units in late January</a>. Clearly, sales have greatly slowed down since, but the game is still a commercial success. Indeed, KONAMI has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that developer Bloober Team would also remake the first entry in the survival horror franchise.</p>



<p>Before the game's launch around a year ago, there were many skeptics about Bloober Team's capability to deliver a remake worthy of the revered original. However, the final product swept those worries away, winning widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike. I<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n Wccftech's review</a>, it earned a 9 out of 10 score from Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>Even better for the series is that even the new game made by NeoBards Entertainment, Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned the same score</a>. Here's what Francesco De Meo had to say about it:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent trademark filing, it was discovered that Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson, the world’s most-watched YouTube creator and a prolific entrepreneur, is planning to open a financial institution. The filing names the endeavour as ‘MrBeast Financial’, and categorizes it as ‘downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for banking services’.</p>



<p>The filing went on to explain that MrBeast Financial would be used to provide short-term cash advances, cryptocurrency exchange services, investment banking services, and consumer lending services.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-youtube-to-big-banking">From YouTube To Big Banking</h2>



<p>Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson is more than ten years into his journey as a YouTuber, and in that time, he has risen to become the number one personality on the platform. He’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and from chocolate bars to restaurants, his entrepreneurial spirit has led him to kickstart many spin-off labels.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=99440901&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, it was discovered that Donaldson’s next foray might be into the financial world, with MrBeast Financial, a banking app, having been uncovered.</p>



<p>The MrBeast Financial platform has been described as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Software as a service (SAAS) services featuring software for banking services, investment banking services, investment management services, providing financial advisory and providing financial consultancy services.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-files-trademark-for-banking-app-with-a-focus-on-crypto-3269568/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The entity would have the power to provide cash advances, issue debit cards, process electronic credit card transactions, and operate a cryptocurrency exchange, amongst other things.</p>



<p>This is all up in the air, as while the application has been submitted, it’s not a promise that such a platform <strong>will surface</strong>.</p>



<p>What are your expectations of the MrBeast Financial app? Let me know what you’re predicting on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Assassin’s Creed Boss Confirms Ubisoft Asked Him To ‘Step Aside’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him-to-%E2%80%98step-aside%E2%80%99.1327333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The news broke recently that Marc-Alexis Côté, a Ubisoft veteran and strategic leader of the Assassin’s Creed series, had departed the company after more than two decades. In the reports that surfaced after Côté’s withdrawal from the firm, it was suggested that he was offered a leadership role in the newly formed Vantage Studios, but wasn’t happy with the position and stepped back.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Côté has set the story straight and explained that he remained business as usual until Ubisoft asked him to step down. He expressly confirmed that <strong>he did not walk away </strong>from the company he has called home for twenty years.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-of-why-cote-left-ubisoft">The Truth of Why Côté Left Ubisoft</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté explained why he’d departed Ubisoft after twenty years, the latter portion of which had been spent managing the strategic direction of Assassin’s Creed. In his words, it wasn’t his choice, and he did not walk away willingly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it.</p>



<div><p>The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p><p>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.<br>A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.</p></div>



<p>But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:</p>



<p>I did not walk away.</p>



<p>I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It mostly gels with what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original report</a> referenced, in that Côté left the company because of a situation related to the new Vantage Studios, formed after the merger between Ubisoft and Tencent.</p>



<p>Côté’s statement indicates his expectations were that he would <strong>lead </strong>the direction of the Assassin’s Creed franchise at Ubisoft, but that wasn’t the case. When that didn’t come through, Côté took it very personally and turned down whatever else was offered as a compromise, ultimately being asked to step down by Ubisoft because he (most likely) had no home in the new organization.</p>



<p>Côté wrapped up his post by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up inspired by Star Trek (TNG!), in the later years of my career I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe.</p>



<p>And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Were you surprised to see Côté leave Ubisoft, or are you expecting these kinds of departures as the merger continues to take shape? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But he has a three-point plan to fix it.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In an impassioned end to his keynote address on the opening day of Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show in Bangkok, Dead Space creator and industry veteran Glen Schofield has declared that the games industry is in dire need of fixing, and he believes he knows just how to go about it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We need to fix the gaming industry right now,” said Schofield to a room of games industry professionals. “It's broken. It's beaten, it's battered, our developers are battered, they've been taking it on the chin for the last couple of years. We need to bring it back to what it was, right? Instead of all this negativity.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first and arguably most controversial step to take in Schofield’s opinion, is for the games industry to widely embrace the use of generative AI as a standard part of their development tool set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“AI isn’t here to replace us,” continued Schofield. “It’s here to make us faster, better, and more efficient. And AI is for all of us, it really is. It’s not just for directors and artists, it’s for writers and marketing execs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I think [games industry] executives, owners, founders… Let's start training our people on AI. Start it as soon as you can. Who cares if I’m EA or Activision or Namco or whatever, we should be working together at least in training and training our people up. That would be a huge help because I know we’re going to start hiring people back again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Schofield believes that investors need to loosen their purse strings and start spending more on games development, as well as putting the right people in charge of each studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Come on, investors and execs, let’s stop this madness,” said Schofield. “You want to make a AAA game for like eight million dollars? You gotta get your guts back again. If we start putting money into the industry again, we know it's going to make money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To me, you picked the wrong people to run the teams, to run the games, right? In my opinion [you need] a big, creative person who’s running it. And then you put people around to help with this and that. That's the way I work these days, right? I still run my studio in ways but I have people to help now so I can be 100% or 98% on that. That’s what these games need. I saw some of the people that were chosen and they were really good people, but there's no way they were ready to direct a game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I said, let's start putting money in, do due diligence a little better on that. We know we're going to make money. But we have to make quality games, and you have to give them to the right people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, and perhaps most strangely given that he was presenting the opening keynote address at a rival games industry show, Schofield wished for the return of E3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bring back E3,” said Schofield to soft applause. “I mean, come on. E3 is the granddaddy of them all. And I will tell you every single E3 that I went to made my games better. And I know there's no formula to show a [return on investment] on that, [but] every game got better when you went there. You talked with your friends, you talked with colleagues, everybody's thrilled to help you with the next technologies, or showing you mechanics. When the companies started going outside of E3 I knew this was the end, and I started boycotting those because [that] was not an industry that was working together, this is an industry that’s fragmented. And so now there’s no E3.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schofield concluded his address by reiterating that while he’s fully onboard with AI, the most important aspect of games development were the people making them, not the machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remember, ideas are the lifeblood of the industry,” said Schofield, speaking to the developers in attendance. “And those ideas? They come from you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do you feel about Schofield’s plan to “fix” the games industry?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new offline mode for Ubisoft’s The Crew 2 is available now, which will allow owners to play the racing MMO offline if desired. The functionality – dubbed Hybrid Mode – has been explained in full on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR/the-crew-2-hybrid-mode-is-now-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>publisher’s website</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Ubisoft, Hybrid Mode gives us the “freedom to choose” how we want to play The Crew 2. That is, online mode (which is “the original experience as it was designed from the start, complete with multiplayer features, leaderboards, summits, and community sharing”) or offline mode (which the publisher describes as “a new experience”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether you’re looking to preserve your progression for the future or simply enjoy the freedom of playing without a connection, Hybrid Mode ensures The Crew 2 remains accessible for years to come,” explains the publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To transfer progression into offline mode, players can simply select “Export to Offline Save” after a session online. Doing so will create a copy of current progression in the game’s multiplayer world stored locally on a personal PC or console. Ubisoft notes online and offline saves are separate, however, so progress made offline will not carry back over into online saves. Players will be able to re-export online saves to update offline files at any time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An offline mode for The Crew 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-but-the-original-is-gone-for-good"><u>was announced last year</u></a> in the wake of the the shutdown of the original game in March 2024. Disappointed players of The Crew (which was not a free-to-play game, but became inaccessible for its owners to play after its shutdown – even solo) were justifiably concerned about The Crew 2 suffering the same fate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games,” Ubisoft said at the time. “Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft was subsequently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-sued-after-shutting-down-the-crew"><u>sued after the shutdown</u></a>, a lawsuit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-the-crew-lawsuit-insists-we-do-not-own-the-games-we-buy"><u>publisher responded to</u></a> by insisting that buying a game doesn’t give players “unfettered ownership rights” to it, but rather only a “limited license to access the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Maid Cafe on Electric Street</em> is a leisurely maid cafe <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,632 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> set in the otaku haven of Nipponbashi, Osaka.</p><p>The protagonist of our story quits his job at an extremely toxic workplace and finds himself at a run-down maid cafe tucked away in a quiet part of Nipponbashi. There, he meets the maid Shiro. One thing leads to another, and he eventually gets appointed as the temporary cafe manager and put in charge of the <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> of the maid cafe. As the new manager, his first task is to scout cute girls to work at the cafe. Time to explore Nipponbashi and all the otaku stuff it has to offer!</p><ul><li>Get to know the four unique main girls: Shiro, Miyu, Favna, and Honoka, all voiced.</li><li>Immerse yourself in lighthearted stories about everyday life with the cute maids.</li><li>Enjoy the modern and gorgeous pixel art graphics depicting even the finest details, including the meat buns next to the convenience store cashier and the figures on the shelves of an anime shop.</li><li>Go on fun dates at Nipponbashi, from anime shops to <a title="Platforms > Arcade [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> to the cinema!</li></ul><p><strong>The Four Main Girls of Fuwa Fuwa</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shiro</strong> – <em>“Um, please be the new manager of the cafe!”</em> A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she’s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she’s always wanted to be.</li><li><strong>Miyu</strong> – <em>“Hey Mr. <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, thanks a bunch for hanging out with me today~☆”</em> A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite. Loves both eating and <a title="Genres > Cooking [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro’s friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.</li><li><strong>Favna</strong> – <em>“I am the Slayer of the False God, the Queen of the Kingdom of Darkness, the All-Seeing Oracle, the Guardian of the Dream of All Things—“</em> A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she’s taken by surprise though, so maybe she’s just got a serious case of chuunibyou…?</li><li><strong>Honoka</strong> – <em>“Ya want a thrivin’ business? That there sounds like a job for our shrine!”</em> A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money, and has a strong sense of responsibility to boot. On top of that, she’s also the only glasses girl at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe!</li></ul><p><strong>Support Your Maid Cafe Employees as the Manager</strong></p><p>As the cafe manager, it’s your job to allocate work to your maids. Make sure to give the right girl the right job! For example, Shiro is always enthusiastic to serve customers, and Miyu is great in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just sit there while they work. During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!<br><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting. As you collect more toys, you can even bring them up in conversations with the girls. Keep cranking those machines until you’ve collected them all!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="『電気街の喫茶店』Nintendo Switch版 発売日＆パッケージ版情報公開【ハイプで応援してね♪】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbrY6r7hSQA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/maid-cafe-on-electric-street-coming-to-switch-on-february-26-2026]]></content:encoded>

It's possible that Amazon received a new shipment thanks to the release of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, which takes place in the same world as Final Fantasy XII.</p><div title="[Various] Final Fantasy X|X-2 and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4713" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Final Fantasy X|X-2 and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo\/dp\/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo\/dp\/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$25 at Amazon | $50 on eShop</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster comes with enhanced editions of both PS2-era hits. Final Fantasy X is widely regarded as one of the best games in the series. The Conditional Turn-Based Battle System was arguably the pinnacle of the franchise's turn-based era, as it added new wrinkles to the decision-making process. Final Fantasy X also placed a greater emphasis on summoning with the new Aeon creatures, and players had greater control over character upgrades thanks to the dynamic Sphere Grid system.</p><p>The world of Spira remains one of the most well-realized Final Fantasy settings, and the main cast, led by Tidus and Yuna, includes some of the best playable characters.</p><p>Final Fantasy X's 3D graphics showed off the power of the PlayStation 2 when it debuted in 2001. It proved to be such a big success that Square developed the first-ever sequel to a mainline game. Final Fantasy X-2 isn't nearly as highly regarded as its predecessor, but it's still a solid RPG that's worth playing.</p><p>Both games hold up well, and the HD Remaster looks great on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Final Fantasy X is on the cartridge, but Final Fantasy X-2 is downloaded from the eShop using the voucher inside the box. Both games are 30-plus hours without including all the side content. You could easily spend well over 100 hours with the remasters.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo\/dp\/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo\/dp\/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$25 at Amazon | $50 on eShop</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy XII ushered in a new era of experimentation for the mainline franchise. Square Enix took a big risk by ditching turn-based battles in favor of a real-time, tactical system that was closer to Final Fantasy XI Online than previous single-player entries in the series. Unsurprisingly, FFXII received a wide range of reactions from fans when it launched in 2006.</p><p>These days, however, Final Fantasy XII is regarded as one of the high points in the series. As mentioned, Final Fantasy XII takes place Ivalice, and the sheer scope of the open world is still impressive today. In many ways, Final Fantasy XII is basically a single-player MMO. It has an excellent quest system, a bevy of secrets to uncover, and massive cast of NPCs to interact with.</p><p>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is the definitive version, as it has improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and the job system from earlier games in the series. The average playthrough of Final Fantasy XII is roughly 40 hours, but there's so much side content that this number can easily double or even triple.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B07JB4ZR2Y,B07HCT37ZV,B0FBZYSJXM,B0FVGBTNHF,B08LB3XQ64,B0FVGG3TBR,B0C3DMTX14,B0DCKFWW1V,B0FQXHSWXS,B0BF7MXQKN,B0B5B1864Z,B09R5JM9RD&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Games for Nintendo Switch 1/2</a></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4586553-finalfantasygamesfornintendoswitch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586553" data-ratio="0.32075471698113" data-width="1325" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4586553-finalfantasygamesfornintendoswitch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586553"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy games for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4586553-finalfantasygamesfornintendoswitch.png"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection: Anniversary Edition</a> -- $65 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGBTNHF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII + VIII Remastered</a> -- $40 | <em>December 9</em><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-VIII-Remastered-Nintendo/dp/B08LB3XQ64?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Edition</a> -- $35.24</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX</a> -- $40 | <em>December 9</em><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-IX-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C3DMTX14?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asia Edition </a>-- $48</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> -- $50  <ul><li><em>Amazon Exclusive Edition includes free poster.</em></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Gathering-FINAL/dp/B0FQXHSWXS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch 2)</a> -- $40 | <em>Jan. 22, 2026</em><ul><li><em>Preorder includes Magic: The Gathering Booster Pack</em></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theatrhythm-Final-Bar-Line-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0BF7MXQKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Theatrhythm Final Bar Line</a> -- $29 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul><hr><p>Final Fantasy fans can get every mainline <em>single-player </em>game through Final Fantasy 12 on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 in physical format. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</a> includes Pixel Remasters of the first six entries in the series.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-8-and-9-are-finally-getting-physical-switch-releases-in-america/1100-6535353/" data-ref-id="1100-6535353">Square Enix announced US physical edition releases</a> for three classic Final Fantasy games that were previously only available as imports: Final Fantasy VII and VIII Remastered Twin Pack is available to preorder for $40 at Amazon; Final Fantasy IX is also available to preorder for $40.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was expected that Pokémon TCG Pocket was going to celebrate its first anniversary in a big way, and it appears it will be delivering on that promise. Here comes the incoming Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising Pack.</p>



<p>We already knew that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shares, an upgrade to trades, and improving wonder picks</a> were going to be on the way, but now we know that the next pack will focus on mega evolutions.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about the next Pokémon TCG Pocket expansion, Mega Rising.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-releases">Do We Know When Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising Releases?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the three headlines in the new packs. Image by The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official announcement for Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising as of this writing, it is expected that the new packs will release on October 30. The release times for updates for these games are very early in the morning for the United States at 2 AM ET.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising">What to Expect in Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</h2>



<p><strong>While we don’t know a ton of what to expect from the Mega Rising packs, you can definitely expect mega evolutions to be heavily featured.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vS2fnu49pw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Back in August</a>, the mobile game released a trailer saying that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mega evolution was going to be coming to the game this fall</a>. As of this writing, there are only three mega-evolved Pokémon we know for sure will be in the Mega Rising packs: Mega Altaria EX, Mega Blaziken EX, and Mega Gyarados EX. The packs that can be opened are split between the three cover Pokémon and should feature over 200 new cards.</p>



<p>When a mega evolution is in play, it will definitely be a big weapon for the player in control. They can be directly evolved from their previous form and give a nice boost in power. However, if the opposition takes down the card in battle, they will instantly win the battle, so be sure you are ready for the fight if you are bringing it in, as that is quite the balance of risk and reward.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shinies-dont-disappear-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> just releasing, mega evolutions are on everyone’s minds. That game brought back the feature in a console game for the first time since Pokémon X and Y were released on the Nintendo 3DS. Of course, Pokémon Go has had mega evolutions for a bit now, so Pokémon TCG Pocket will not be the lone mobile game to feature the mega popular power-up creatures.</p>

<p>Did you know that Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-artwork-from-new-set-after-plagiarism-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed artwork due to some plagiarism claims</a>?

It will run from now until 4th November 2025, and gives trainers who reach 'Rank K' a special reward of <strong>Greninjite</strong>. This item can be used to Mega Evolve Greninja into Mega Greninja, and "can't be obtained through normal gameplay".</p>
<p>The official Pokémon website further explains the three types of rewards for Ranked Battles. You'll get rewards at the end of the battle (regardless of your performance), and promotion rewards are gained when you advance to the next rank (this includes items for training such as Mega Shards). The last type of reward is a seasonal reward, which is based on your ranking at the end of a season.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59xiytlp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The Apex Legends live service wagon just keeps rolling along, consistently bringing out new battle passes and content to keep players coming back time and time again. Up next is Apex Legends Season 27.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-apex-legends-season-26-fuse-mad-maggie-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 26, titled Showdown</a>, Apex Legends brought in a new permanent game mode called Wildcard, focusing on faster gameplay and chaos. It also added amps, which make a new way to augment your team in tough situations. Now, it’s time to look to the future.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about Apex Legends Season 27.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This place may look very different soon. Image by Electronic Arts</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is not an official release date announced for Apex Legends 27 as of this writing, leaks are suggesting that the update will happen on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>Of course, things can easily change between the information that leakers get and an official announcement, but typically, this does line up with the usual release for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-expected-decline-further-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> seasons, which last about three months.</p>







<p><strong>You should expect the update for Apex Legends Season 27 to go live around 10 AM PT / 12 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 7 PM GMT on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>This is the usual time that seasons go live in the game, unless, of course, there are setbacks in the server maintenance or possibly delays.</p>



<h2 id="h-leaked-content-in-apex-legends-season-27">Leaked Content in Apex Legends Season 27</h2>



<p>The biggest leaked content that people are talking about in the upcoming Apex Legends Season 27 is a second Olympus. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KptWKFHZI3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apex Legends leaker HYPERMYST</a>, there will soon be new screens displayed around the Olympus map that say, “Discovery on Pagos: Another Olympus?” If you ping that screen, your character will have a unique voiceline mentioning the scary prospect of a second copied city appearing out of nowhere.</p>



<p>So what does the second Olympus mean for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-launches-on-nintendo-switch-2-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a>? We highly doubt that this will be an additional map added to the rotation. Instead, the current version of Olympus might be getting a significant rework, this time receiving a lot of ice theming considering the mention of Pagos. A potential in-game event could follow it.</p>



<p>Outside of the second Olympus, HYPERMYST also says that the Sentinel will be getting a reactive skin, and Bangalore, Lifeline, and the Hemlock will be getting legendaries in the battle pass. There is also <a href="https://x.com/Osatou_Apex/status/1976969684949074254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">footage of dual-wield blades</a> coming to the game alongside the new season.</p>



<p>As of this writing, that is all we know about the Apex Legends Season 27 update. Expect some official announcements to be coming very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ask any gamer who travels or shares a living space: <strong>one screen is rarely enough</strong>. Whether you’re running a Switch on the go, playing Xbox in another room, or extending your gaming laptop setup, a secondary display changes everything. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor delivers that upgrade without the bulk or the cost. It’s slim, lightweight, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">and now sitting at an all‑time low on Amazon at $69, down from $99.99</a>. At this price, it’s one of the most affordable full HD portable gaming monitors you can grab right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Convert Any Console or Laptop into a Dual-Screen System</h2>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> monitor <strong>houses a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) IPS panel with clear detail, deep color capture, and generous 178-degree viewing angles</strong>. In other words, sharp images regardless if you’re gaming on the Switch, connecting a PS5 or extending your PC setup for extra workspace. Its <strong>HDR</strong> technology ramps up contrast so things can feel more vivid, blacks get deeper, and motion remains fluid even in swift action scenes.</p>



<p>The screen boasts <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI connector</strong> and you get plug-and-play convenience with laptops, game consoles and phones with video output. One cable more often than not does everything and you get power and display that is a big advantage if you’re flying light or hate dealing with multiple adapters. Plug it into your console and you’re good in an instant for big-screen console gaming in a hotel room.</p>
<p>Weighing a light 1.7 pounds and a slim 0.3 inches in thickness, the monitor can fit easily into any backpack or laptop sleeve. You’re able to game in landscape orientation for hardcore gaming, switch it up into portrait orientation for livestream conversations, coding sessions, or reading files. It’s the type of display that transitions from gaming into productivity and does so without losing anything. The <em>KYY</em> also features practical add-ons which add up in the long run: You get a high-grade PU leather smart protective cover which also functions as a collapsible stand.</p>



<p>The stereo speakers built into the display provide respectable audio for everyday use, though headphones or an external speaker can always be plugged in through the <strong>3.5mm jack if more complete audio is desired</strong>. Along with the matte anti-glare coating, the eye-care mode and blue light reduction, the screen itself seems comfortable enough to gaze at for extended periods.</p>
<p><span>With the price cut all the way down to $69 from Amazon, it’s in a clearance range that’s difficult to resist.</span></p>

                <p>If you've been hanging around in a field hoping for the Great Pumpkin to appear, then you're going to be waiting a long time. The only spooky pumpkins coming your way this year are in Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, the pumpkin-carving MMO that's back online after its planned hiatus</p><p>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was created by Whippoorwill Ltd aka Adam R. &amp; Dawn B., and the game sends players into a literal ghost town where they can take part in the in-game Halloween festival and pumpkin-carving contest. Players can win prize ribbons from other players who dole out awards to their favorite pumpkins. The game also encourages players to wander around the small town and customize their ghost avatar.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dROr2wZ6FDA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dROr2wZ6FDA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Previously, Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was limited to 200 players at a time. This year, the game has added support for 800 simultaneous players. There are also new areas to find, including the Ghost Town Cinema, which plays classic silent movies. Some of the other activities in town include exploring a haunted and a hayride.</p><p>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival can be <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">downloaded at its official site</a> for PC, Mac, and Linux. Players can name their own price, but if they choose to pay $2 or more, they get a version of the game that includes hats for ghosts. According to Adam R., the game has already set a record this year with 24,000 pumpkins created by players since the game's return earlier this month.</p><p>The team behind the game has also said that Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival will be taken down a week or two after Halloween, presumably before its inevitable return in 2026.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-campaign-is-an-act-of-narrative-cowardice.1327228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> features the series' first singleplayer campaign since 2018, which as a fan of both <em>Battlefield</em> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumb AAA shooters</a> had me pretty excited! After rolling credits yesterday following roughly five hours of action, I should have known not to get my hopes up.</p><p>Unlike the last few games, which shipped with either glorified tutorials or no campaign at all, <em>Battlefield 6's</em> singleplayer harks back to entries in the series like <em>Battlefield 3</em> &amp; <em>4</em>, which tried their best to mimic <em>Call of Duty</em> and craft an actual story around a singular campaign. While there's still a whiff of tutorial here--you're introduced to a number of multiplayer maps, and slowly taught how to use the game's various weapons, gadgets and vehicles--for the most part <em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign plays like it's earnestly trying to be a proper, singleplayer shooter.</p><p>If you are interested in those solely for the big explosions and bits where you drive a tank around, you're in luck here. This game blows a lot of stuff up in quite spectacular fashion, with buildings and sometimes entire streets frequently collapsing around you, while also presenting you with loads of ways to fight bad guys in big and interesting ways. In just the most superficial, sensory way, this is very much a modern military shooter.</p><figure></figure><p>While you're doing all that stuff though, you'll be interrupted frequently by cutscenes that attempt to tell you a story, to provide some context to all your jet-setting and cross-border destruction, to give you a reason to kill all those guys you need to kill. And honestly, I'd skip every single one of them.</p><p>I'm as aware as anyone that military shooters can feature questionable politics, that they struggle to squeeze coherent plots full of intrigue and international realpolitik into their limited runtime. Those are issues <em>Call of Duty</em>, and even previous <em>Battlefield </em>games, have struggled with for decades. But man, even with that bar set as low as I thought it could go, <em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign <em>still</em> sails comfortably under it.</p><p>In its opening 30 minutes it clears its throat, opens its mouth then says...nothing. Nothing at all. Or rather, nothing that could upset anyone. Like so much other AAA stuff these days, it’s paralysed, caught between the desire to have a point to it all and the reality that having a point can sometimes be bad for business. You can see the bones here, buried under what could have been months of meetings and strategy and input across DICE and EA, of a story that wanted to say something about the times we're all currently living through. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is set in a near-future world where alliances are breaking up, where NATO is divided and new, sinister forces stand ready to challenge the world order.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 - Intro Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhLzMPfQojo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>This is the campaign's intro, which seems pretty interesting given <em>everything going on right now</em>. But that guy's murder is completely forgotten about within the hour. Nothing this says ever means anything.</figcaption></figure></div><p>That, uh, sounds pretty familiar to anyone alive in 2025. Or 2022, or whenever serious narrative work on this game started. And could have been the perfect introduction to a campaign that went through with that, to put some boots on the ground in a story about Russia taking advantage of European division and civil unrest to destroy their Cold War foes, or of nefarious authoritarians seizing power in the United States. None of which happens in this game.</p><p>Of course <em>Battlefield </em>has no <em>obligation</em> to put forth its take on modern politics, no remit to provide commentary on the rise of fascism in the United States or the fracturing of international diplomacy. The problem here is that it starts down that road! It could have been a game about anything, from historical conflicts to big wars against Russia and China--all things <em>Battlefield </em>has done in the past with no hesitation!--but nope, within minutes of firing it up we see this game walk right up to some very contemporary issues, size them up then swiftly walk away, abandoning them in favour of some bullshit that even after finishing I'm still not quite sure I fully understand.</p><p>There's some kind of tale here about a wronged soldier fronting a global paramilitary force that is somehow able to take on the combined forces of the USA and Europe, with some shadowy CIA stuff thrown in for good measure, but from beginning to end the whole thing is simply ridiculous. A company amassing the manpower to fight whole continents--or at least doing so under the context provided here--is comedic, and the idea that its soldiers would fight to the last man, as though they were conscripts clinging to the ruins of Stalingrad instead of random dudes dressing up like NAVY Seals for a paycheck, is even dumber.</p><p>It all means so little, and is explained so poorly, that I was actively forgetting things while I was still playing through it.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Even by <em>Call of Duty</em> or <em>Battlefield's</em> standards, this is a stupid game. And not the <em>good </em>kind of stupid. Half the appeal of these shooters is that they're Hollywood explosions, that like an action movie you just start them up, disconnect for a few hours then get back to life. <em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign would have been fine if it had tried to be that kind of stupid, to just pick a convincing bad guy, make them threaten something we care about and let us have at it. <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's</em> plot isn't too far from <em>Battlefield 6's</em>, and for all the ways we've collectively moved on and mostly forgotten it, it at least knew what it was and had the confidence to revel in it.</p><p>This game instead sets its sights on a weightier topic then falls miles short of it, leaving us with something even more forgettable, because the only thing worse than a game saying "press F to pay respects" is a game that says nothing at all.</p><p>I guess I'm just particularly frustrated here--shaking my head at the story of a five-hour singleplayer campaign for a game people only play for the multiplayer, I know, it's weird--because like I've said, it feels like someone at some point was trying to say <em>something</em>. Maybe those foundations were the only parts of a story the writers were allowed to get into the game before other departments and cowards sanded everything else smooth. Maybe years ago, when work first began on <em>Battlefield 6</em>, DICE could see the direction the world was headed in, just like they had with <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, a game about climate disasters.</p><p>For all I know--and if you were involved, I'd love to know--there was a more substantial exploration of the theme planned here at some point, a campaign that tried to say something about the world we've living in, before someone more concerned with shifting units than telling stories stepped in to say no, we can't alienate the fascists who will be buying this video game, or no, we probably shouldn't paint a target on the Nazis currently running the United States government, or the millions of Twitter users (potential customers!) whose knowledge of the war in Ukraine has been entirely decoupled from reality.</p><p>And hey, as far as EA is concerned that would be a prudent move. This game has already sold millions, and there are hundreds of thousands of people playing it right now at any given moment, all around the world. Huge swathes of that fanbase wouldn't have cared what the story was, so long as they got to shoot some shit in it. But surely <em>somebody </em>cared, I cared, that if you're going to start trying to tell a very modern story about a dying world order and a military conflict that could reposition it, you could have at least tried to go through with it.</p><figure><figcaption>One last thing: this game's coffee machines are weird</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like many other live service games, everyone is always looking forward to the next season of content, so we continue the cycle with Marvel Rivals Season 5.</p>



<p>In Season 4, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela were both added to the playable roster, adding to the already expansive set of heroes in the duelist and vanguard classes.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect Marvel Rivals Season 5 to begin.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-5-release-date-and-time">Marvel Rivals Season 5 Release Date and Time</h2>

<p><strong>Marvel Rivals Season 5 will begin on November 14 at the usual start time of 2 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>The date has been confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1974142618360570254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NetEase as of the release of the Season 4.5 roadmap</a>, which notches that day as&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is a table that goes over the release in major time zones.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-5">What is Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5?</h2>



<p><strong>As of this writing, there is no official announcement of the new content coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5, but various leaks, rumors, and in-game references point to Gambit and Rogue being added to the hero roster. Leaks suggest Gambit is a duelist and Rogue is a specialist.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Additionally, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cross-progression-season-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cross-progression</strong></a><strong> is making its full debut for all players after some have been able to test it in Season 4.5.</strong></p>



<p>With Gambit and Rogue being such a powerhouse couple being added to the game, the theme for Season 5 is rumored to be focused on romance and love. An interesting theme to take considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> had the Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman wedding day skins and event, which was held earlier this year.</p>



<p>The Season 4 Gallery Card also teases an upcoming tournament being held by Shou-Lou, who is directly linked to the new K’un-Lun map. With this map just recently being added, we would be surprised for another to be added so soon, so this tournament might be a new in-game mode, potentially something similar to Overwatch 2’s Stadium Mode, which was introduced in that game earlier this year.</p>



<p>That is just about all we have heard for possible content coming to Season 5, but knowing NetEase, there will be some surprises in store, including new skins, especially themed around romance.</p>

		<p>It’s been a while since we heard a peep out of Quantic Dream. While they’re now publishing titles, as well as developing their own, most people are waiting on tenterhooks for more news about Star Wars Eclipse, the game they’re working on for Lucasfilm/Disney. However, they’ve clearly got time to work on other things as well, with today’s announcement of Spellcasters Chronicles, a free-to-play, 3v3 online multiplayer title.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmI8nzNHR8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the reveal trailer, Spellcasters Chronicles has plenty going for it. It looks like it merges MOBA-style gameplay with a more direct, third-person viewpoint, and it’s definitely looking the part, utilising an anime-inspired art style to bring its world to life. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, and the fact that it’s free-to-play will mean there’s very little reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>“We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios,” said David Cage, Founder and President of Quantic Dream. “Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players’ feedback and to perfecting this journey together.</p>
<p>This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative. It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars Eclipse.”</p>


<p>If this sounds like your sort of thing, there’s a closed beta coming up that you can sign up for now, with dates due to be announced soon. You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/beta">https://www.SpellcastersChronicles.com/beta</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-offloads-the-delta-2-for-pennies-clearing-out-leftover-stock-following-the-delta-3-release-2000636090</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-offloads-the-delta-2-for-pennies-clearing-out-leftover-stock-following-the-delta-3-release.1327192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EcoFlow built its reputation on one device: the Delta 2. It became the go‑to power station for campers and anyone who needed quick and reliable energy without the fumes or noise of a gas generator. Now that the newer Delta 3 is out, EcoFlow is clearing out stock and Amazon has dropped the 1800W Delta 2 to its lowest price ever: This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">&nbsp;best‑seller is down to $429, from its original $699, a record low 39% discount that makes it hands‑down the smartest buy</a> of the season if you’ve been considering portable power for home backup or outdoor adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Similar Performance Than Delta 3</h2>
<p>Although the Delta 3 has some improvements, the Delta 2 still meets the same sweet spot in terms of power, speed, and reliability all at a significantly lower price. With a<strong> 1024Wh capacity and peak output of 1800W</strong>, the station can power most household devices, tools, or entertainment equipment. Consider mini-fridges, coffee machines, gaming stations, and even hairdryers – <strong>this little hulk powers up to 90% of the things we all use daily</strong>.</p>



<p>The outdoors enthusiast also relishes the dual purpose of the Delta 2 as a solar generator with up to 500W solar input capability: You can pair it with matching panels (sold separately) and charge green while camping or off-grid. It’s the perfect configuration for RV power, work anywhere, or charging devices in an environmentally friendly manner. What’s more, its minimum base level 1kWh capacity can be increased easily with add‑on batteries up to 3kWh: That versatility converts the Delta 2 from a weekend camping friend into a serious residential backup solution.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting to commit to the EcoFlow ecosystem, this deal can’t be missed. The Delta 2 still houses the same high-end performance that brought the brand into the spotlight and for $429, it’s darn close to a steal. Once inventory dies off, the price isn’t returning this low at least for some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re into anime, chances are you’ve watched Solo Levelling. It’s been one of the best shows of recent years – albeit one that’s a massive power fantasy, but then, aren’t they all? One of the most anticipated RPGs of next year, Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive, looks to bring that power fantasy to life in stellar fashion, and publisher Netmarble will certainly be pinning a lot of their hopes on its success. Things are definitely looking good though, and in preparation for the game’s appearance at TwtichCon San Diego in the US, the developers have dropped a brand new gameplay trailer showing off some of the game’s combat features.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. What’s great about the series is that he spends the first couple of series hiding these newfound abilities, but there’s definitely the sensation that things might take a turn for the worse in the near future, as he gets more and more powerful.</p>
<p>There’s lots of levelling up and fighting off fantastical creatures in Solo Levelling, so it’s little surprise to see Arise Overdrive focusing on that. As it’s a series based on the idea of a world that’s being experienced like a video game, it’s a perfect match, and one which I can see Netmarble doing a good job with. Combat looks swift and flashy, and there’s definitely some similarities to be found with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XVI, taking on huge creatures with melee weaponry and visually impressive special moves. </p>


<p>Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive is due to launch on November the 17th for PC via Steam and Xbox Series consoles. If you fancy checking the game out before that at Twitchcon San Diego, that’s going to run over this weekend, from the 17th to the 19th of October. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a new campaign book for their WWII pulp action TTRPG. <em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> continues the war between the Allies and the Axis powers, with the latter delving into dark occult works, shifting the venue to the icy regions of Norway.</p>

<h2>The Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p><em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> is a 156-page hardcover campaign book. The campaign is divided into three parts and features nine linked missions across the Norwegian front of the game's alternate history of WWII. The campaign builds on Modiphius' 2d20 RPG system, which has powered other TTRPGs such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-royal-flush-ttrpg-adventure-set-in-new-vegas-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dishonored-role-playing-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dishonored</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-star-trek-adventures-second-edition-starter-sets-now-available" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek Adventures</em></a>.</p>

The Nazis are desperate to turn to the tide of the war and look to developing atomic weapons. To prevent this, the Allies launch Operation: Grouse, Freshman, and Gunnerside, where they race to prevent the Axis from acquiring the Norwegian heavy water plant at Vemork.</p>

<p>But, since this is <em>Achtung Cthulhu</em>, the threat of nuclear devastation isn't the only danger to contend with. Enter the little-known Norwegian cult the Flokk of the Allfather, whose arcane knowledge may provide a darker, and faster, source of atomic power than conventional science.</p>

<p>The mission is a race against the clock where the players must rescue resistance fighters, uncover a vast conspiracy threatening to rain atomic fire on Allied cities, and fighting tooth and nail against horrors beyond mortal ken such as the Daemon Sultan Azathoth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re delighted to finally give fans a chance to get their hands on The Norway Projekt. If you’re looking to take your agents on an epic campaign through the coldest of fronts, with a chance to foil eldritch cults, battle Nazi super science and change the course of the Secret War, then this will be a perfect addition to your collection!’ - Achtung Cthulhu Line Editor John Houlihan</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> is available for pre-order now on Modiphius' store at an MSRP of $55. The book is expected to ship January 2026.</p>
