            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T has officially been canceled by publisher Behaviour Interactive, and not only that, but the game's development studio has also been shut down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Behaviour says that following a playtest for&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>in July, the studio "ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective".</p>
<p>Behaviour goes on to say that while players "expressed appreciation" for&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>during the playtest, the outcome of the studio's "deep analysis" ultimately yielded "unsatisfactory overall results", leading to the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project T</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-t-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-gameplay.jpg?itok=1DxIWXu8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-t-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-gameplay.jpg?itok=7HCzoQMQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is officially dead...by daylight.</figcaption></figure><p>Behaviour doesn't go into any more detail regarding why the results of its playtest were "unsatisfactory", and since that kind of information is likely to stay within the studio, we'll probably only find out if a former developer speaks out at some point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're not likely to be seeing anything from the developers in their current state, because according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple</a> former Midwinter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241867580527804417/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers</a> on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregory-marques-39a711_my-studio-abruptly-closed-today-midwinter-activity-7241917376005349376-pHsG/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, the studio has been closed down along with&nbsp;<em>Project T</em>'s cancellation.</p>
<p>One employee describes Midwinter's closure as "abrupt", possibly indicating that staffers perhaps weren't warned about the studio shutting down in advance, which could in turn suggest that Behaviour made the decision fairly abruptly.</p>
<p>In any case, <i>Project T</i>, which was first fully unveiled just a few months ago as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s eighth anniversary, is no more, and neither is Midwinter, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-t-canceled-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-environment.jpg?itok=OmuOpM7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-t-canceled-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-environment.jpg?itok=8R0eduX8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project T&nbsp;</em>had some pretty convincingly spooky vibes, but it is sadly no more.</figcaption></figure><p>The game wasn't the only&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff shown during that anniversary celebration; we also got to see some of&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">has since been released</a>, as well as cutesy-looking multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>What the Fog</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself also remains active, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date">two&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>characters</a> recently joining its roster and a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover"><em>Five Nights at Freddy</em><em>'s&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> waiting in the wings as well.</p>
<p><em>Project T</em>'s cancellation and Midwinter's closure come against the backdrop of a brutal couple of years for the gaming industry, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">multiple studios being hit by layoffs, cancellations, and closures this year</a>.

<p>Spotted by reliable Rockstar news source Tez2, the developers “accidentally included” Red Dead Redemption PC’s metadata in the latest launcher update that introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-cheat for GTA 5</a>. However, Rockstar has promptly removed the data, and players can no longer spot files about RDR1 PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tez2 has linked the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2668510/info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> page for Red Dead Redemption’s PC port. In the update history section, players will see that developers provided three updates for the listing yesterday, and the changelog shows regular updates over the past few months. However, it hasn’t been confirmed as the official SteamDB page for Red Dead Redemption’s PC port.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1836018840150458526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videotechuk_</a> is another reliable source for Rockstar Games news, and they recently provided more details about the launcher update. Based on the X post, the update included data for several games, including Americas, GTA III Definitive Edition, GTA IV, GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition, GTA V, GTAV Gen 9, GTA Vice City Definitive Edition, LA Noire, LA Noire VR, Max Payne, Red Dead Redemption, and Red Dead Redemption 2. It’s worth noting that “Project Americas” is believed to be the internal codename for GTA 6.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is Rockstar’s first entry that takes us on an expansive journey across the Wild West. The game was first released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2010 and received a port for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2023. However, this top-rated single-player adventure has yet to receive a port for the PC and the current-gen consoles, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.&nbsp;Players speculate that the latest find might lead to an official announcement from Rockstar. </p>



<p>In other news, Rockstar Games reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-song-band/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered $7500 to use a band’s song</a> in GTA 6. Also, check <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether the highly anticipated Rockstar release has been delayed to 2026</a>.

                <p>It's not uncommon for video game projects to be delayed by unexpected issues. But GSC Game World, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-clear-sky-review/1900-6198116/" data-ref-id="1900-6198116">STALKER</a> and its upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-november/1100-6525281/" data-ref-id="1100-6525281">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, had the terrifying and unique experience of being disrupted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Now, the first trailer for a new documentary, War Game: The Making of STALKER 2, chronicles the struggle that the team had to go through in order to finish the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWyO6X3hQsQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PWyO6X3hQsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Andrew Stephan directed War Game, which takes viewers behind the scenes at GSC Game World as their lives were upended by the invasion. Creative director Maria Grygorovych and her team were previously based in Kiev before the start of the war. But GSC Game World ultimately had to move development from Kiev to Prague while the fight for their homeland continues to this day. War Game was sponsored and produced by Microsoft, and it will be released on Xbox's official YouTube channel.</p><p>"It wasn't my dream to do this film," Grygorovych told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/stalker-2-ukraine-war-developers-doc-xbox-1236146958/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. "But I really think it's important to share... We are really not public people and it's hard to share something personal. But when this opportunity comes to us from Microsoft, we thought that it's important to share with the world a little bit more about how difficult it is to live in a wartime from the personal side... When you see specific people who can share some real story, maybe someone can imagine how hard it is and why any war is something bad. It's impossible for me to find some reason to start a war."</p><p>Not all of the team members fled the country, and some stayed behind in Ukraine to fight. One of STALKER 2's developers, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-the-developers-of-stalker-2-weathered-the-ukraine-war-to-make-their-game-the-deanbeat/#:~:text=One%20Stalker%202%20developer%2C%20Volodymyr,its%20web%20site%20as%20well" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Volodymyr Yezhov</a>, gave his life while defending the city of Bakhmut from Russian forces in December 2022. Grygorovych noted that some of GSC Game World's programmers, QA members, and community managers enlisted with the Ukrainian army despite not being professional soldiers, and she hopes to welcome them back to the company when the war comes to an end.</p><p>War Game: The Making of STALKER 2 will premiere on YouTube on October 3. STALKER 2 will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC on November 20.</p>

If they can find them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Konstantin Kopka, the game’s designer, to talk about how ecosystems and stages helped shape the game’s unique animals, the challenges that would lead to them adopting an on-rails movement style over an open world, and why they gave the player a tool to fidget with as they waited for that perfect photo opportunity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> sees players snapping pictures of eerie creatures in an abandoned wildlife park. Can you tell us a bit about what inspired you to create this experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kopka: Our main inspiration was, obviously, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the N64 and our childhood memories of playing that. We tried many different approaches to figure out the best design and ended up with our take on what we thought was the "heart" of that experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We took many mechanics and tried to improve on them to make the levels and monsters as interesting as possible and focused a lot on replayability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> straddles the line between cute and creepy. What drew you to capture these two feelings with the game's visual style?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The art for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was done by my brilliant sister, Elenor Kopka, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elenorkopka/">who also does animated short films and ceramics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Weird, ghostly things were a common obsession for all three of us, but Elenor brought the cuteness with her art style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing the game's various creatures and creating a whole ecosystem filled with strange beings to photograph?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like all creative ventures, this was a very iterative process. We started with a small roster of creatures to see how they would look in-game and kind of just went from there. Over time, through the collaboration of Elenor (art) and Philip Feller (animation), the park's inhabitants grew to over 100 distinct creatures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As soon as we had the vision for the different levels locked in, we tried to think about how the creatures would fit into the park's ecosystem, why they would be there, what they would do, and how we could set the scene for them.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into the creature's behaviors and the faces they make? How did you create and design all of the little actions and things they do so they felt natural to this world and would give the player interesting things to take pictures of?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elenor and Philip did a brilliant job with that. I am really happy with the uniqueness of them all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed a system of symbols (e.g. a smiley face, a frowny face, etc.) to give us a general guideline on what poses we would build. In the end, most creatures ended up with a mix of "standard" poses and one or two poses that are completely unique to this particular creature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A very important design guideline we discovered was that it was important to have that ideal "photo moment" in the pose to give the player something to aim at.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have the action take place on-rails? How did that affect the design of the game in ways both good and bad?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For a long time, initially, we actually had the game set in an open world, and we were very enthusiastic about this because it seemed cool and new.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We ran into tons of issues with this, however. The world felt very empty and confusing. As soon as we scrapped this aspect and made it a focused, on-rails experience, things just clicked into place and became much more fun to play. It was not an easy decision, but I think the game ended up better because of it.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>As the game plays on rails, what thoughts go into creating a world and inhabitants that offer interesting photo opportunities when movement and perspective are limited?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The on-rails aspect meant that our level design process was almost like designing a ride in an amusement park where you can exactly control when and where things happen. This made it easier for us to create suspense, and even (very light) jump scares.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to have the player (eventually) be able to stop the cart entirely posed some challenges because it restricted what we could and could not do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game rates the player' photos of the creatures as they snap pictures. What drew you to add this rating system? What thoughts went into choosing how this system would grade the pictures?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our biggest frustrations when playing and re-playing the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game was the tedious, slow rating process that happened after you finished the ride. So, from the start, we knew that this was something we wanted to improve and make way more fluid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rating algorithm is actually quite sophisticated. It even detects things like "how much of the creature is actually visible in the photo and how much is obscured by the environment, grass, etc."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, by having a one to three-star rating system, we allow for 100% completion of the game, which is important to some players.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the design of the photo album and giving the player a nice place to put their pictures while also offering some useful gameplay elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the photo album to feel very rewarding and fun to browse, so we made sure that the process of putting the best snapshots into their slots would feel satisfying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The camera has the ability to show the player a different take on the world with the Ghost-o-Vision. What drew you to add this functionality? What interesting elements do you feel it added to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Ghost-o-Vision mechanic is introduced a bit later in the game and adds the new challenge of limiting the time the player has to find the ghost. It's also related to the lore of the park and I think it adds a nice bit of diversity to the overall mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to allow the player to interact with the world using the Grappling Hand? What do you feel this element added to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought it would just feel good to shoot stuff with a huge grappling hook/hand thing, so that was the main reason we added it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over time, we figured out more and more how this would actually be used in the game. For example, the ability to shoot and destroy parts of the environments was added very late in the development but quickly became a favorite. It's also a nice "fidget" mechanic that allows players to do something while idle, especially if they already replayed the level a lot.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has stated AI is "the very core of our business" and the company has over a hundred "active novel AI projects" to assist with game development.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company held its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI">Investor Day 2024</a>, detailing its next games and innovations: including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">The Sims</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedis-final-chapter-currently-in-development-at-respawn-says-ea">Star Wars Jedi</a> and Battlefield.</p>
<p>Yet AI was a major part of the presentation. Speaking of generative AI, Wilson said: "This remarkable technology is not merely a buzzword for us, it's the very core of our business."</p>

<p>The company has over a hundred AI projects, said Wilson, across three strategic categories.</p>
<p>Efficiency is not just about cost saving but "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality", he said. Expansion is about "giving our creative teams an exponentially bigger canvas upon which to create" by adding depth and intelligence to characters and personalising stories. Lastly, the company will accelerate innovation and the creation of content through Transformation.</p>
<p>"For years we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different," said Wilson. "We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfil this promise for billions of people for billions and billions of hours."</p>
<p>So how are these AI projects being put into practice? Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment and Technology, spoke at length about AI opportunities - after briefly running through forthcoming single-player games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and the Star Wars Jedi games, as well as the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>.</p>
<p>At present, EA's current game-development infrastructure handles a billion AI requests daily, Miele said, while the company's AI tools power in-game features for stable game experience, personal recommendations, and create a fair and secure gaming environment.</p>
<p>One specific example of AI use is in The Sims for its forthcoming hub that acts as a central platform for all series games. AI is powering discovery tools so that Sims players can search for suitable in-game assets using photos rather than text.</p>
<p>Through photo-based searching, players can find housing elements or even upload a photo of a real human to create their likeness. While powerful, there's also potential for this sort of function to be abused.</p>
<p>Another example is EA's new Script to Scene tool, which essentially allows game development to be done through text or voice prompts. This includes creating characters and scenes, as well as direct performances, all using generative art, AI-enabled game development, and procedural generation.</p>
<p>These are clear examples of how AI is already impacting game development. Indeed, as Eurogamer reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">AI is already used by 62 percent of studios</a>, according to a report by Unity. Character animation was the biggest use case.</p>
<p>And just yesterday, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">Nvidia boss Jensen Huang who discussed the advantages of AI</a> as a key component for advancing graphical capabilities.</p>
<p>Other areas of AI use are for NPCs, scriptwriting, and voice acting, which have all received criticism.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-will-feature-new-storytelling-tech-that-will-be-used-across-various-ea-studios/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In July 2023, following several rumors, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be working on a Black Panther game in development by Cliffhanger Games, a Seattle-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in 2021 by Kevin Stephens. At the time, EA said it would be a third-person single player action/adventure game featuring an original story.</p>
<p>After quite a bit of silence on the project (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-reportedly-in-development-at-motive-will-launch-before-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch after Motive's Iron Man game</a>), Laura Miele (president of EA Entertainment and Technology) revealed some interesting tidbits about the Black Panther game while she discussed the company's efforts in the $20 billion action/adventure and action/RPG segment of the market during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA's Investor Day 2024</a>.</p>
<p><em>Next is our studio in Seattle, Cliffhanger Games, and its renowned leadership team known for innovative action RPGs such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Black Panther will be a love letter to fans combining vibrant characters, the world of Wakanda, an original story, and all-new technology, delivering groundbreaking design and storytelling that will actually transfer across many games and studios in our company.</em></p>
<p>The most interesting piece of info is the new tech hinted at by Miele. The new technology will deliver 'groundbreaking design and storytelling' not only in the Black Panther game but also in future EA games, as it will be used by other internal teams, too.</p>
<p>No further details were shared at this time (the game is still in early production), but it's hard not to connect the dots. Kevin Stephens, the founder of Cliffhanger Games, was originally a Director of Engineering at Monolith Productions before becoming its Vice President and Studio Head. As such, he certainly had extensive knowledge of the <a href="http://wccftech.com/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-video-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemesis system</a> featured in Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.</p>
<p>At the time, the Nemesis system was praised for creating unique moments between the player and the NPCs; while far from flawless, it hasn't been replicated in any other game to date. It's possible Cliffhanger is working on a similar concept, perhaps empowered by generative AI (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being used extensively at EA</a>). We'll have to wait for actual Black Panther game details to know for sure, but it is certainly an intriguing prospect.</p>

            <p>As per EA’s recent <a href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">generative AI tugathon</a>, the third game in Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> adventure Star Wars trilogy has been confirmed again to be in development. According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Jedi Fallen Order</a> and 2023’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Jedi Survivor</a>.</p>
<p>The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedis-final-chapter-currently-in-development-at-respawn-says-ea">Eurogamer</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, EA’s s president of entertainment and technology, Laura Miele, had this to say during a presentation at the company’s investor day:</p>
<p>“Over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."</p>
<p>The same series of presentations also saw EA CEO Andrew Wilson say that generative AI was at the “very core of our business”, and EA showcase some sort of <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1836190095910523025">horrific creativity-begone machine</a>.</p>
<p>Respawn’s previous two offerings were both well received, although Jedi Survivor has been plagued with performance issues on PC - although a recent patch looks to have helped.</p>
<p>Last September, series director Stig Asmussen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-jedi-survivors-director-is-leaving-ea">left EA after a decade at Respawn</a> - despite making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy">comments to IGN</a> earlier in the year that he has “always” seen the Jedi games as a trilogy.</p>
<p>“An undeniably fun Star Wars sequel with a suitably epic story and smart combat, but a hell of a lot of busywork alongside it,” was Alice Bell’s (RPS in peace) verdict in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Jedi Survivor review</a>. My own verdict is that I lasted an hour before having to change the spoken language from English because I disliked the main character so much. I also decided I didn’t want to play anymore at all an hour later, though, so don’t listen to me. Very good lightsaber hitting, though!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text / audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “…not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “…I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; “I’d spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast.” The word “sh*t” appears in the text / dialogue.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>The recent first look at the PS5 Pro also showcased Horizon Forbidden West running on it, so another update for Horizon Zero Dawn wouldn't be an unusual move for Sony. On top of that, fans of Aloy and the post-robot-apocalypse can also look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-release-trailer-story/1100-6526137/" data-ref-id="1100-6526137">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> later this year, as that game puts a more lighthearted spin on the series.</p><p>It's also rumored that Guerrilla is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/" data-ref-id="1100-6510122">Horizon multiplayer game</a>, so things are looking quite busy right now for the franchise.</p>

		<p>Achilles: Legends Untold is getting free DLC content today in the shape of Fates of Moira, a collection new gameplay modes that are available to play once the main story campaign is completed. The name is reference to the character Moira, who becomes a central part of this mode, and it also deals with the fates with different challenges awaiting Achilles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles Legends Untold: Fates of Moriai - Update 1.5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2ytN7qanH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The three modes that Achilles: Legends Untold Fates of Moira brings are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Inevitable Fate of Atropos: Precision and caution are your greatest allies. Every melee hit you land instantly kills any non-boss enemy, but the stakes are equally high for you—one hit and Achilles falls.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Fate of Clotho the Spinner: Achilles constantly loses HP, pushing you to play aggressively to stay alive. Using Hades Vision pauses the life drain, and you can heal by killing enemies with Drain Souls. However, you can’t attack or use weapon skills in Hades Vision, adding tension and strategy to every move.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Fate of Lachesis The Allotter: A relentless Laistrygon hunts you on every map, immune to conventional damage but can be slowed or debuffed. It grows stronger over time, forcing you to survive through strategy and cunning. The Ariadne’s Thread can temporarily remove the threat, but be prepared—it will return stronger than before.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the announcement of the free DLC, Dark Point Games has also confirmed that Achilles: Legends Untold is available from today on PS4 and Xbox One, with a Nintendo Switch release following later this year. Paweł Waszak, CEO of Dark Point Games, said, <em>“Given the strong demand and numerous requests we’ve received from our community, we decided it was important to make our game accessible to a wider audience. That’s why we’re excited to announce that we will be releasing the game on older-generation consoles, including Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. We want everyone to be able to enjoy the experience, no matter what platform they’re on.”</em></p>


<p>In our Achilles: Legends Untold review, Adrian said, <em>“The Greek Myths have been plundered by video game developers to such a degree it’s hard to conceive that a fresh take could be even possible. Remarkably, Achilles: Legends Untold offers just that. This action-adventure might be a little rough around the edges, but that arguably adds to its charm. If you can put up with some nasty difficulty spikes then you’ll find a remarkable world of myths and legends to explore.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-reckon-theyve-worked-out-the-real-world-location-shown-in-the-new-concept-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>EA finally started talking about the new Battlefield game this week, with head of Respawn and group GM for EA Studios Organization Vince Zampella telling <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">IGN</a> it will use a modern setting. IGN also exclusively revealed the first concept art for the new Battlefield, below, which in turn set the game’s community off on a detective hunt to work out where in the real world it was set.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/16/battlefield-concept-art-1726502144551.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Now, fans reckon they have a pretty good idea where the concept art takes place.</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential Battlefield spoilers follow:</em></p><p>Video game content creator TacticalBrit tweeted to say the concept art shows a war-torn Gibraltar. Various points of interest in the concept art line up with shots of the real world Gibraltar, making this one nailed on.</p><p>“Makes perfect sense for any game with a theoretical conflict as Gibraltar acts as a strategic bridge between Europe and Africa,” TacticalBrit added.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After doing more takes at the Battlefield Concept art.</p><p>I feel almost 80% certain this is infact Gibraltar.</p><p>Makes perfect sense for any game with a theoretical conflict as Gibraltar acts as a strategic bridge between Europe and Africa. <a href="https://t.co/RodDI4zq68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RodDI4zq68</a></p></div>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1836116916806783077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Gibraltar appeared in 2006’s Battlefield 2142 via the Camp Gibraltar Conquest-only map, so the franchise has featured the British Overseas Territory before. That’s all we really have on the new Battlefield though, save snippets of information Zampella gave to IGN, such as the unpopular Specialists system being ditched in favor of more traditional classes. The concept art also suggests ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will be part of the new game, and that it will feature natural disasters like wildfires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Battlefield Review</h3></div></output><p>Four EA-owned studios are working on Battlefield: DICE for multiplayer, Criterion for single-player and multiplayer, Motive for single-player, and Ripple Effect for a "new experience." There’s no release date or launch platforms yet. Also in out interview, Zampella offered his thoughts on the recently announced PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vince-zampella-defends-the-ps5-pro-price-battlefield">including on its $700 price</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-heavily-underperformed-as-square-enix-reports-disappointing-profits.984174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> have heavily underperformed compared to previous entries in the series, further highlighting the flaws of Square Enix console-exclusive's strategy.</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/pdf/24q4outline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a>, the publisher reports that profits in its HD Games sub-segment for the current fiscal year did not meet expectations despite the release of Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Net sales in the MMO and Games for Smart Devices / PC were also lower than in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Talking specifically about Q4 of the current fiscal year, the report highlights how the two major publisher releases, the initial sales for Foamstars and the already mentioned Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, were not as strong as expected. In addition, an <em>"impairment made to the content production account"</em> resulted in an operating loss.</p>
<p>While Square Enix generally has sometimes unreasonable expectations, it seems like this is one of the rare cases when the publisher is reasonable, as both Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth really underperformed compared to previous entries in the series, as highlighted by analyst Daniel Ahmad on X.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is one of the rare cases where Square Enix is being reasonable, as both games really did underperform compared to past entries.</p>
<p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1836334410477527294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is a real shame that both games have underperformed on the market, as they are both very solid entries in the series. However, things could be turned around by their PC and potential Xbox console release. Final Fantasy XVI has been released this week on PC and seems to be doing well on Steam according to the current Top Sellers list, so hopefully, sales will end up being strong enough for the game not to be considered a commercial failure in the end. You can learn why the game deserves more in terms of sales by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> yesterday received its latest update that massively buffs player weapons and rebalances the game in their favour.</p>
<p>However, players still aren't completely satisfied and are requesting a new harder difficulty level to compensate. And, creative director and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt agrees.</p>
<p>A Helldivers 2 fan responded to Pilestedt's call for feedback on X (formerly Twitter), stating: "Everything is great but we need a new harder difficulty now." Pilestedt responded simply: "I agree!"</p>

<p>As part of re-balancing efforts, many primary weapons have received a damage boost, an increase to their magazine size, or a shorter cooldown, while support weapons and Stratagems have received significant damage boosts.</p>
<p>Further, partial damage dealt to enemies has been increased and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> now take less damage from headshots.</p>
<p>"With these changes, along with an upgraded Helldiver arsenal, enemy adjustments, and more consistent damage, the overall difficulty may slightly decrease. We'll be monitoring this closely and will listen to the community on how you think it feels," wrote the developers in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859">update's extensive patch notes</a>.</p> <div>

<p>The update also brings a new Galactic War feature where strategically important assets are displayed on the map, as well as a new Emote Wheel feature, and other changes and bug fixes.</p>
<p>What's more, the update has brought back a surge in players.</p>
<p>In May, we reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">game's peak concurrent players had taken a significant hit</a> and its average players had dropped by 62 percent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the update's release, Helldivers 2 reached a peak of 68,380 players (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>). That's a far cry from its launch days of 458,709 peak concurrent players, but still double the number of players from the last couple of months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Thanks to some alleged pictures of factory prototypes, the first look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-official-name-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> design may have finally arrived.</p>
<p>The pictures, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, were shared to an unspecified Discord server by a Chinese user who received them from someone under NDA, possibly a factory worker. Judging from the pictures, the console's design seems to line up with the rumors we have heard so far, as it is bigger than its predecessor, features a bigger screen, and has magnetic side rails for the new Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p>Together with the pictures allegedly showing the system, the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Le8OI2i">Nintendo Switch 2 specs</a> were also leaked, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/comment/lnpntd5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they</a>, too, line up with some of the rumors we have heard in the past few months, such as the 12 GB of LPDDR5X @7500 MT/s RAM and the 256 GB of flash memory. Sadly, no information can currently be gleaned from the SoC model name, but if all these specs are real, we are surely going to hear more about the system's capabilities shortly.</p>
<p>As the pictures and the leaked specs come from an anonymous source, we have to take everything above with the biggest grain of salt, especially as it seems to line up a little too well with the vast majority of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks from the past few months. Thankfully, the console is likely going to be revealed soon, so it won't take much longer to see what Nintendo has been working on for its next-generation system.</p>

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">skate</a>. game now has an (admittedly vague) early access release date of 2025, according to <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235">a post by the developers</a> on Xitter. It's difficult to write about the new skate. game because if you choose to write skate. with the imposed stylings which skate. publishers Electronic Arts insist, you end up putting a full stop after every instance of skate., which makes your sentences about skate. sound fucking stupid. and. belaboured. with. pauses. Game makers, please stop putting punctuation in your game names.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"we're incredibly stoked to announce that skate. will be launching in Early Access in 2025. we'll share more details on what to expect in the coming months," say developers Full Circle, fully embracing the lower case, except for the words "Early Access". </p>
<p>Punctuation chaos aside, the skateboarding game looks like great fun. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skates-chaotic-playtest-videos-are-the-best-marketing-the-game-could-ask-for">footage we've been shown</a> so far shows wonderful prototype sandboxes, and dozens of skaters bailing off rooftops and sailing down skyscrapers set up like a big human pachinko machine (see below). There's also whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVjkBnQ2B1pIQWlUDDQLU_2Cnfzv3Cuxu">playlist of full of highlights from testers</a> and some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu0MY53Hz00">excellent bail compilations</a>. Meanwhile the developers have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaDU2afjG-w">regular informal chitchats</a> about what's happening in-house. </p>

<p>That sense of transparency hasn't always been 100% voluntary, mind. A multiplayer version of the game's alpha was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-multiplayer-version-of-the-leaked-skate-4-build-is-out-in-the-wild">leaked online in 2022</a>. But even this doesn't seem that big a deal for a studio who appears to lean into semi-open development. I quite like seeing blockouts of unfinished levels and work-in-progress animations that twist and contort in alien ways. It's a nice reminder that video games don't just appear fully baked. For a long time, they look like hilarious ad-hoc playgrounds made out of cardboard and brightly coloured string. It looks incomplete, yes. But there's something appealing about a level in prototype. Sometimes a sketch can be as pleasing as a finished piece. I once blocked out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azxLKXgH8bs">a  construction site</a> for skateboarding sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/session">Session</a>. It was basic as hell, but I was happy with my big cubes and simple colours.  </p>
<p>If EA's new game can replicate some of that fun - of building your own skate park - I'll be happy. For now, I have cautious hopes. Session was great for realistic foot physics. And the arcade high-scoring of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> gave me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-review-so-good-it-will-give-you-blisters">thumb blisters</a>. But the return of this series will hopefully offer a wacky world somewhere between hardcore sim and cartoon kickflipper. The big caveat is that this remains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-4-is-now-just-skate-and-will-be-free-to-play-with-microtransactions">a free-to-play game by EA with microtransactions</a>, and the live service model is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">not always wholesome</a>. </p>
<p>All that said, I'm not doing "skate." anymore. It's just Skate now. I don't care if that causes people to confuse this new entry with the original Skate from 2007. You should have thought about that when you decided Skate 4 wasn't good enough, EA. I am sticking to the longstanding RPS principle: if your game's name is formatted stupidly, we will either fix it, or make fun of it, or both.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text/audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “...not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “...I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; "I'd spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has admitted that profits of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> "did not meet expectations".</p>
<p>The comment comes from its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/explanatory.html">financial results briefing</a> held in May and finally made public today.</p>
<p>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu shared the results, stating: "In the HD Games sub-segment, we released multiple new titles, including major titles such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but profits unfortunately did not meet our expectations."</p>

<p>Further, he stated initial sales of Foamstars and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - released in Q4 of the last financial year - were "not as strong as expected".</p>
<p>It's important to note these comments were made in May, at the same time Square Enix announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>. Shortly after, reports it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">laid off a number of employees in its US and European offices</a> emerged.</p>
<p>At this point in time, Final Fantasy 16 had been out for a year and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth less than three months.</p>
<p>Still, there has been much speculation around the sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">reported underperformance according to industry analysts</a>.</p>
<p>Sales tracking from Circana previously stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the fourth top-selling game in the US</a>, but remains far behind sales of previous entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>The release of Kiryu's statement today, then, is the first official acknowledgement of the game's sales. Still, it's unclear by how much the game "underperformed" and Square Enix is notorious for its high expectations.</p>
<p>Much has also happened since this financial report. Firstly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Final Fantasy 14 expansion Dawntrail</a> was released in July, which will likely have had a positive impact on overall company profits. We'll find out in the next financial briefing.</p>
<p>Secondly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-doesnt-want-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods-on-pc-release">Final Fantasy 16 was released yesterday on PC</a>, continuing the company's push towards multiplatform releases.</p>
<p>And while Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remains a PS5 console-exclusive for now, it's likely it will follow Final Fantasy 7 Remake with a PC release in future.</p>
<p>Could these games also come to Xbox? Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-to-further-deepen-the-relationship-with-xbox-gamers-says-final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida told Eurogamer</a> the company would like to "further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers" following the release of the MMORPG on Microsoft's console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The deckbuilding roguelike genre has been solved at this point. I don’t mean that in a bad way; it’s just that we’ve had a lot of takes on it since Slay the Spire really boosted the genre into the stratosphere. Demon’s Mirror, then, has a fairly large obstacle to overcome, because how do you stand out when there are already so many options to choose from? It turns out the answer is by also throwing in a match-3 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon's Mirror - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmwM3g188q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It takes a little bit of time to adjust to the way that Demon’s Mirror does things, and it initially feels as though the card game and the puzzle game are essentially separate. The only thing that appears to connect them is that a couple of your cards can interact with the board, and that everything costs energy, which means you need to decide if you’re better off matching a bunch of tiles to attack, get energy, get armour, or get willpower, or if you should use a card to do one of those same things or something else.</p>


<p>However, as you get to grips with not only the three characters available, but also the core mechanics each of them has, and then start properly building around them, everything starts to mesh together to make for a smoother experience. My favourite character of the three is one who can apply a unique status effect called influence, which basically represents them talking to the enemies you’re fighting, and if you can apply more influence than they have health remaining, they get taken out of the fight.</p>


<p>Despite being my favourite, this was also the character I had the hardest time finishing the game with. I could see an incredibly cool build in there based on skill cards that cost 0 energy, a card that applied influence X amount of times (where X was the number of skill cards you’d played), and a card that allowed you to put any 0 energy cards back into your hand from your discard pile if you matched green tiles. I then just needed the right relics, which ended up being ones that could reduce the cost of green tile chains, and a couple of others that let you match for free if you played enough cards.</p>
<p>Once I had this working, it took maybe four runs for everything to properly coalesce in both my head and my hand, until I suddenly had a build that actually beat everything within the first two turns. I just needed to keep thinning out my deck until the combo was guaranteed, and then just play a lot of cards to draw more cards and keep doing so for free, until the card that allows you to inflict three influence for each skill card would hit upwards of 200 in total.</p>

<p>The reason I spent two paragraphs detailing that one specific combo is because Demon’s Mirror is full to the brim with different builds to explore and combinations to mess around with, and you can make the game harder or easier with special modifiers you unlock, as well. There’s not as much to do here as there is in some other examples of the genre, but what is here is a delight.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Demon's Mirror is a wonderfully refreshing take on the whole deckbuilding genre, and well worth a look if you want something that genuinely feels new. If you've never played one of these before, however, then it's probably going to feel pretty tough to begin with, but it'll be worth it.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>A universe that includes a film and Project Rene, which is sort of Sims 5, maybe</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
People waiting impatiently for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>: you have sinned against Simming and must do penance. In your temerity and ignorance, you have cried out unto developers Maxis and publisher EA for another sequential helping of the cuddly/sociopathic neighbourhood-building game - a "sequel", if you will. Know ye not that we live in the time of Disrupted Models? Sequels are archaisms devised by the old gods in their dotage. Let us all join hands and set forth into the sunny uplands of the Connected Cross-Media Cross-Platform Universe.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The Sims will move beyond linear, sequential Sims releases and offer more options for players than ever before," explains <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">an EA blog post about the future of the series</a>, published yesterday. "We're focused on creating a variety of games and experiences that will touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, mobile narrative games and continued depth, improvements, and modernization of The Sims 4, which will continue to be a foundational Sims experience."
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/">Variety</a> (ta <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">Eurogamer</a>), The Sims franchise general manager Kate Gorman explained the thinking in slightly more detail. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise started with Sims 1 and then Sims 2, 3, and 4," she began, in a useful refresher for those of us still wrestling with the whole "sequel" concept. "And they were seen as replacements for the previous products. [But now,] we are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we're only going to be adding to our universe." 
</p>
<p>
But what could this mean??? "What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a 5," Gorman continued, "but it doesn't mean that we're going to start you over... As we think about the future of it, we want you to continue all of those families and generations. Those creations are your progress, your attachment. 
</p>
<p>
"We don't want to reset your progress. And so it's not about... what the numbers are in the games, but know that the future of the franchise looks more like keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience, and not a start-and-stop experience between products." 
</p>
<p>
Beyond this point, the brain of the writer buckles and cannot reassemble the majesty of EA's vision into cogent paragraphs. I am forced to resort to the simplified, World War-era medium of bulletpoints. Here's roughly what the Sims universe will encompass, based on the blog post and the interview above.
</p>
<p>
- The mysterious Project Rene, which "is focused on building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world". There's a small invite-only playtest happening later this year, which will give "an early look at a multiplayer experience that explores joining friends and other players at a shared location". I guess this could be something approximating a "Sims 5", if you're desperate. EA have previously said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-sims-game-will-be-free-to-play-with-paid-dlc">Project Rene would co-exist with The Sims 4</a>, and would be a free-to-play game with DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-devs-definitely-want-to-have-multiplayer-are-looking-at-animal-crossing-for-inspiration">multiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing</a><a></a>
</p>
<p>
- a Hollywood movie adaptation in partnership with Amazon MGM Studios, with Loki director Kate Herron directing and Dr Who scribe Briony Redman on the writing team. I think Margot Robbie is involved somehow. Make it like the Barbie film, please
</p>
<p>
- Continuing to improve and maintain The Sims 4, a venerable but very popular game. EA are "investing in meaningful new features and base game updates", so as "to evolve the game in both appearance and gameplay experience"
</p>
<p>
- expanding The Sims FreePlay, a mobile game spin-off, while developing another mobile experience or game, Project Stories
</p>
<p>
- "Reinvigorating the MySims product line, beginning with two lovable games available soon on Nintendo Switch", Nintendo's charming cut-price Steam Deck - the games in question are MySims and MySims Kingdom, which together form the MySims: Cozy Bundle. It burns, it burns!
</p>
<p>
- A set of creator tools, a player content gallery, a marketplace, and a social network, to be shared across Sims games
</p>
<p>EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-rene-aka-the-sims-5-shows-prototype-lighting-animation-routines-in-latest-video">revealed some strictly WIP footage of Project Rene last year</a>, with prototypes of daily routines around the neighbourhood and new animations for moods and reactions. I've popped a screenshot from one of those prototypes at the top of the page, there. Again, it does <em>sort</em> of feel like Project Rene will be something approximating a traditional Sims sequel, but I reckon I'll be struck by righteous lightning if I spell that out too avidly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In many ways, the announcement of Fairy Tail 2 was an unexpected but welcome surprise. While there's no denying the popularity of the series by Hiro Mashima, Koei Tecmo and Gust gave no indication that the franchise would continue to bring a close to the original manga's storyline.</p><div>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to try out the game before its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-december/">December release</a> and speak with Producer Hiroshi Kataoka, discussing the setting, characters, battle system, future content, and more. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>The original Fairy Tail was almost universally praised for being a very good adaptation of the manga by Hiro Mashima, but many found it difficult to keep up with the story and characters without any prior knowledge. Is there anything in the new game that addresses this issue?</strong></p>
<p>We have a few systems in place to address this issue. For starters, at the beginning of the game, there's an event that is specifically focused on looking back at the past story. We also implemented a glossary in the main menu, which allows players to check terminology as well as learn more about characters and their past, so it's easy to learn what happened before the Alvarez Empire Arc. During dialogues, there are also words highlighted in yellow, which can take the player straight to the glossary, even during gameplay. So, to enjoy Fairy Tail 2, it's not necessary to play the original.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Tail 2 features an all-new original story called Key to the Unknown, set after the events of the Alvarez Empire Arc and the original story. Is there more original story besides this new epilogue?</strong></p>
<p>There is more original story, but it's not a lot, and it's mostly found in sidequests and optional content. Fairy Tail 2 is all about respecting the original IP, and we didn't want to break the flow of the original narrative. When it comes to the original story we added, including the epilogue, Mashima-sensei checked everything, so players and fans can look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest changes featured in Fairy Tail 2 over the original is the battle system. Why go from a classic turn-based system to the new real-time one?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few reasons for the change. The first game featured a turn-based battle system to help newcomers to the genre and let them have fun right away, but its slow pace wouldn't have been suitable for what happens in the second game. The Alvarez Empire arc, which is the last arc of the original manga, features a lot of combat against some very powerful enemies, and I felt that a faster, more action-based combat system was better suited to properly adapt these battles. Being the final battle, it just had to be faster.</p>
<p><strong>Many role-playing game series are moving away from turn-based combat and employing more action-oriented systems. Do you think there's still a market for classic turn-based games?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think the market is shifting towards one or the other. It all depends on what kind of battles someone wants to have in their games. You can do interesting things with both turn-based and action-focused combat systems. Personally, I still find turn-based combat fun, but for Fairy Tail 2, I felt that an action-oriented combat system would have been best. It really depends on the game.</p>
<p><strong>Are there multiple difficulty settings?</strong></p>
<p>Fairy Tail 2 features multiple difficulty settings. We have an easy mode for beginners to enjoy the story, but we also have more battle-focused difficulties for those who find the other difficulties too easy. There's a total of four settings, so it's not either easy mode or normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Tail features a lot of characters. How did you pick the playable characters? Are more coming after release?</strong></p>
<p>The playable characters were picked based on their role in the final battle against the Alvarez Empire. We picked those involved in the battle in the original story. There will be some additional characters coming after launch, but we can't specifically say who is coming right now.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about additional content, will there be more story added to the game after release?</strong></p>
<p>We will release additional free and paid content after the release. We're still deciding what to release specifically, but I can confirm that more content is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, will the Fairy Tail series continue? If so, would a new entry in the series feature an all-original story, or will it adapt the 100 Years Quest story?</strong></p>
<p>There's definitely the chance of more Fairy Tail in the future, but right now, it's hard to say if there's going to be another entry in the series and if it will adapt the new story or feature original content. It all depends on how Fairy Tail 2 is received. If players want more sequels, we will consider developing them and speak with Kodansha, who holds the IP, on how to proceed. So, there's definitely a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>If you could adapt any other manga series, which would it be?</strong></p>
<p>I like old manga series, and I would love to adapt some works from Leiji Matsumoto. I really like Space Battleship Yamato, and I would love to make a game based on it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Investor Day</a>, which also saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> of the third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson outlined the core importance of generative AI for the company's future. Following up on <a href="https://wccftech.com/generative-ai-will-allow-bigger-more-immersive-worlds-says-ea-and-developers-were-hungry-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his previous statement</a> that generative AI will allow bigger and more immersive worlds, Wilson explained how EA is using this technology for its upcoming projects as part of its bid to outpace market growth through 2027 and double the audience to over a billion users.</p>
<p><em>AI in its different forms has always been central to this creative journey. We all remember playing against the AI, and it has evolved into today's innovations in generative AI. This remarkable technology is not merely a buzzword for us; it's the very core of our business. Beyond writing or coding AI to ensure the believability of our characters, we have always used forms of machine learning and AI across our games and processes. Right now, we have over 100 active novel AI projects across three strategic categories: efficiency, expansion, and transformation.</em></p>
<p><em>Let me first talk about efficiency. This does not just mean cost savings today. Efficiency is doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality. That means driving more iterations, more testing and high quality content for our communities. It means removing obstacles for our game developers. It means culturalizing content across geographies so they can focus on finding more fun for more players around the world. The lowering of these friction points leads to deeper gameplay experiences.</em></p>
<p><em>Expansion is about giving our creative teams an exponentially bigger canvas upon which to create and richer colors so they might paint more brilliant worlds. It's about our incredible teams creating characters with more depth and intelligence, telling stories that are more personal and nuanced, and bringing more authenticity and deeper immersion. For years, we at EA have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different. We predict that with generative AI, we will truly be able to fulfill this promise for billions of people and billions of hours.</em></p>
<p><em>Transformation is about looking much farther into the future and finding new ways to play, watch, create, and connect that aren't imagined today. We believe AI will greatly expand and transform the entertainment experience for user generated content. It will accelerate how innovators and creators in entertainment are building and delivering experiences rooted in self-expression, content creation, curation, and instant gratification, the kind of entertainment that today's players and fans deeply crave.</em></p>
<p>Bold words indeed from the EA CEO, although Electronic Arts is not at all the only big company to believe in generative AI's potential to disrupt the gaming industry. Microsoft, for instance, partnered with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-inworld-ai-qa-everyone-in-gaming-sees-the-potential-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inworld AI</a> to create a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiplatform AI-powered toolset for game developers</a>. Ubisoft also <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> off an interesting demo at GDC 2024 powered by Inworld AI tech.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts appears to be developing an in-house solution rather than relying on a third party. Either way, we might be looking at an influx of games featuring some sort of generative AI implementation in the next few years.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Having gone to bed last night with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> installed yet unplayed on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, I awoke to find Valve have slapped the moody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with Unsupported status for the handheld. Its crime: an inability to "run well" on the Steam Deck’s internals, regardless of settings changes. Dammit, Clive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve given it a whirl myself this morning, and while a literal interpretation of "unsupported" arguably doesn’t apply to FFXVI – the Steam Deck can still launch and run it without detonating in one’s hands – it does ask a little too much of the hardware. The Low quality preset and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a> on Ultra Performance is enough to keep me above 30fps in plenty of fights, but other areas will easily knock that down into the 20-25fps range, or even into the teens. Which ain’t particularly nice to play, even if you are still technically playing. FSR 3 can provide frame gen as well as upscaling, but this manages to make things worse, introducing heavy stuttering in exchange for only a tiny handful of extra generated frames.</p>
<p>(Strangely, nothing performs worse than the cutscenes, which I’ve repeatedly seen collapse to around the 17-20fps region for no clearly apparent reason. Though at least this pre-empts any potential annoyance about them also being capped at 30fps on PC.)</p>
<p>Also, and this isn’t part of Valve’s Steam Deck verification criteria but I can and will moan about it anyway: it’s a 152GB install. 152GB! So even if you decide the tough out the framerate dips, FFXVI is going to devour the lion’s share of any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">Steam Deck SSD</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a>. 152GB, honestly. You could fit twelve copies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls II</a> in that. Or six <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Risings</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-pc-performance-best-settings">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, this makes it two Big Budget Action Games Where You Play a Grumpy Man With a Sword in a row that fall just short on Steam Deck performance. As for how Final Fantasy XVI’s new PC port takes to more traditional PC hardware, I’m currently locked in the benchmark dungeon trying to find out, though I suspect you won’t want to take your chances with anything below the minimum requirements of a RX 5700 or GTX 1070.</p>

Here’s the official blurb, from Nintendo:</p><blockquote>The warriors from Double Dragon join forces with the toad-acious Battletoads trio to form the ultimate team in this 1993 beat-’em-up! Tussle with terrific twins Billy and Jimmy Lee as they team up with Zitz, Rash and Pimple to defend the Earth against the combined might of the Dark Queen and the Shadow Boss! Leap from the Battlecopter onto the tail of the Colossus spaceship and fight your way through beastly baddies and lethal objects using the Battletoads’ arsenal of Smash Hits or the Dragons’ array of Dragon Force Techniques – each provides incredible attacking combos, including kicks, punches, throws and more! You’ll also put your driving skills to the test with the Speeder Bike and high-speed Space Pod. How will this struggle for Earth’s future end?</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-4-1726648535968.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Battletoads Double Dragon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Next, we have Jaleco’s Big Run, a racing game originally released for the Super Famicom in 1991. Check out what the game is about, per Nintendo:</p><blockquote>Race across the vast landscape of Africa – from Tripoli to Dakar – over the course of nine stages in this racing game originally released for the Super Famicom system in 1991. This monumental task isn’t only about putting pedal to the metal, though! First, you’ll need to select a sponsor and then use those funds to hire staff. Next, you’ll need some spare parts to replace tires and engines when they get damaged or worn out. The glory of victory awaits if you can combine precise tactics and bold driving to weather the brutal driving conditions that stand between you and your goal.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-5-1726648565847.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Big Run.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle is a 1993 action puzzle game developed by Namco and originally released for the Super Famicom.</p><blockquote>The Cosmo Gang take on falling-block-style puzzles across three modes in this 1993 action-puzzle game that was originally for Super Famicom. Focus on clearing blocks to get the high score in 1P Mode, play competitive battles in VS Mode and put yourself to the test in 100 Stage Mode, where you can solve stage after stage of strategic challenges. In each of the modes, progress is made by removing containers and Cosmos that fall from the top of the screen. You can remove the containers by lining six up in a horizontal row — and Cosmos are removed when they touch the blue orbs that occasionally make their way down. Though the two types of blocks are cleared in different ways, try to see if you can perform a combo by clearing both types at once!</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-6-1726648607092.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>And finally, Technōs Japan’s sports game Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Shūgō!, which came out on the Super Famicom in 1993, is available. The Kunio-kun series, known as River City outside Japan, is now in the hands of Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works, with recent revivals from WayForward.</p><blockquote>This sports game, released for the Super Famicom system in 1993, features Kunio-kun (who you may recognize from the River City series!) and his striking dodgeball moves. Take the field and square off against teams from various countries and employ a variety of jumps, passes and dynamic knockout shots as you aim to become the greatest dodgeball team in the world. Plus, each stage has hidden gimmicks to discover, so your matches may even take some unexpected turns! Build your ideal team, power up with in-game items and train your teammates to be the best they can be.

            <p>EA has officially announced a film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> is in the works and aims for it to have an impact like the Barbie film.</p>
<p>The film will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/barbies-margot-robbie-to-produce-the-sims-movie-adaptation">produced by Barbie actress Margot Robbie's production company LuckyChap</a>, with Loki director Kate Herron at the helm.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/the-sims-movie-plot-details-amazon-ea-margot-robbie-1236142126/">Variety</a>, EA's vice president and general manager of The Sims Kate Gorman discussed the company's plans for the film and the inclusion of fan-favourite Easter Eggs.</p>

<p>"What I will tell you is it's very much rooted in The Sims universe," said Gorman. "And what we want is to have a truly authentic Sims experience brought to a theatrical release. So what you'll see from us is that we have been wanting to get this right. We wanted the right partners and to make an impact the size of something like a Barbie movie is exactly what we want.</p>
<p>"And we know there's so much love and nostalgia, probably beyond what we would even realise, for The Sims and so many people like us have played throughout generations. So we want this to be an experience that reflects all that amazing history and play of so many people in this world, but also is something that you can share across generations and to be part of pop culture and culturally relevant."</p>
<p>Gorman has promised an "authentic Sims experience" that will see its universe "come to life" with "classic experiences".</p>
<p>"There will be Freezer Bunnies," Gorman confirmed. "I'm sure a pool without a ladder is somewhere in there, but we haven't finalised any of those details. But that's the idea, is to say that it lives within this space. It's a nod to all of the amazing play and creation and fun that people have had over the last 25 years within The Sims."</p>
<p>Freezer Bunnies, for those who haven't played The Sims, have recurred in the games since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a> as cute toys spotted in freezers, toy boxes and more.</p>
<p>Herron not only directed the first season of Disney+ series Loki, but wrote a script for an episode of Doctor Who and will be directing episodes of HBO's The Last of Us season two.</p>
<p>Yesterday, EA shared a blog post explaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">the future of The Sims</a>. The company confirmed it's not working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> and is instead moving "beyond linear, sequential Sims releases".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered has been rated by the ESRB for the PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>The rating comes following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-pre-order-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> and rumours suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation will have a State of Play</a> coming by the end of the month.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB rating</a> summary reads, “This is an action/role-playing game in which players assume the role of a hunter (Aloy) surviving through a post-apocalyptic world. Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text/audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “…not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “…I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; “I’d spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast.” The word “sh*t” appears in the text/dialogue.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear when PlayStation could announce Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, but the rating suggests it’s likely very soon and could be used to show off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro features</a>.</p>



<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was first released in 2017 and, as of April 2023, has sold over 24.3 million units. On Metacritic, the game received an 89/100 for the PlayStation 4.</p>
