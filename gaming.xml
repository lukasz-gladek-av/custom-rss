			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment revealed Road Kings, the latest chapter in their successful series of racing simulation games after MudRunner, SnowRunner, Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, and Roadcraft.</p>



<p>Whereas most of the previous games focused on off-road driving, though, this one is squarely aimed at delivering the definitive trucking experience. Players will start out as rookie drivers behind the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South, from Jacksonville to Savannah. They will have to keep an eye on everything that real truck drivers do, from regulations to fuel, unpredictable weather, and much more. There's even going to be a narrative component that ties everything together, exposing the human element to the drivers and everyone involved in trucking.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to chat with Saber Interactive Porto Game Director Peter Mack and Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits about Road Kings, which is scheduled to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141130/Road_Kings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X consoles (a Nintendo Switch 2 port is still under evaluation).</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Peter, which game did you work on before this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This is the first project I've worked on at Saber Porto. My experience before this was working with smaller LEGO games at another company, but I've now been with Saber Porto for many years.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so this is the first project you've been doing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> With Saber Porto, yes.</p>



<p><strong>How long have you been working on this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This project started production around three years ago and was in pre-production for a year before that.</p>



<p><strong>Does this run on your proprietary engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> No, it's Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using any of the signature features, such as Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes, we're taking advantage of a lot of features that are now available.</p>



<p><strong>I don't know if you can share that, but is Road Kings also coming to the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I would have to get back to you on that.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> We haven't quite decided that. Yeah, we're investigating it, but we're looking at our pipeline and stuff. One of the things to add to his answer about technology is that yes, it runs on Unreal, but we are leveraging the knowledge and experience that Saber has developed with Snowrunner, road crab, Mudrunner, you know, and any fantastic. We know vehicles. We know big vehicles, and we know trucks. You can really feel that it's solid, real, when driving. We have been praised for our realistic simulations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Saber has done many racing simulation projects about trucks and stuff like that. Where does Road Kings sit in this portfolio?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I feel this is a spiritual successor to all of the simulation-centered titles that have come before it. It's inspired by them and it makes a very nice complement to Saber's other racing simulations.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Yep. Right in the middle! We are very proud of it. We've added that Saber spirit to it, where you are the hero of the open road. It is a true truck simulator, but you do so much more. You help people in need, you help communities in need...</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> It's very human.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> It's about trucks. At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</p>



<p><strong>You said there is a story in Road Kings. Can you talk a bit about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. As I was just saying, trucks are a huge part of society, so they are involved in a lot of very important things to a lot of people. We tried to create a story that touches on these facts and what we've learned by talking with truck drivers and understanding their lives. We tried to create a narrative that the player, as part of an immersive simulation, can engage with or not. If you like to just sort of work and drive for long-haul trips over the road, you can, but if you want to engage with a sort of narrative experience, you can do that, too.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Especially in America, where trucking is very important. The country is really big, and we don't have trains like in Europe, so the trucking culture in America is very unique. Tapping on what Peter said about that spirit and human factor, that is really important.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There are also all the changes that are happening in the industry right now. When we were doing research for Road Kings, we were reading about and speaking with people about their fears about the impact technology has on trucking. If you look at blogs lately, it's about autonomous trucks and when they are coming and what they are going to do to this very important aspect of society that has existed in the United States for hundreds of years, and how it's going to be affected. Along with that, there's the change in the technology of the trucks. There is a change going on in the climate and the increasingly unpredictable weather, which often affects drivers and puts them in danger. All these things are for us narrative components to bring into stories you encounter in the game..</p>



<p><strong>Can you share how long the story of Road Kings is going to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I understand it's topping out at about 10 hours of gaming, but that's pretty much if you sail right through and if you do story beat after story beat.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> I mean, it's a simulation game. You can play forever beyond the story.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There is also a layer of procedurally generated conditions and stories that you can encounter. For example, the dispatcher can call you up. Again, taken right from the pages of drivers, blogs, and diaries, they call you up and tell you that they made a mistake and the job you're doing is wrong, and can you do them a favour and take it to the other side of the state? And if you say yes, if it's convenient and makes sense, you get a reputation with the dispatcher, and if you say no, you get paid as normal. So, in addition to it being endless in terms of the simulation, there's even the sort of endless aspect to the small stories you can encounter.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The weather is dynamic, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Does it include icy conditions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Let us get up toward Missouri and we can talk about that, but right now you're in sort of north Florida to southern Georgia. So, we don't have snowstorms for now, but we're looking at it.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk about the asynchronous multiplayer mode?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a leaderboard for the player-created companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Is it cross-platform? Can you invite a friend who plays the game on another platform?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Indeed!</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support Road Kings post-launch, with more content and features?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Absolutely. 100%. We already have a lot of content planned for after launch. We find that this game lends itself very easily and naturally to expansion, not just in terms of geography, but in terms of truck types and customizations. All is expandable post-launch, but we also see very easily that we can add more stories and more narratives and more dispatchers, and more companies. I think we have fifteen more companies already lined up to be considered.</p>



<p><strong>Would these be premium DLCs, or possibly some free DLCs, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I think we're looking at a plan that includes all of the above.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you both for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Watch out! EA claim to have created "the most dangerous ring in gaming" for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale, and they won't stop waving their lethal hoop around in a post that runs down the mode's features ahead of its first Labs playtest.</p>
<p>Prior to now, all we've gotten battle royale-wise have been teases, with the devs busy seeking feedback on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s more standard multiplayer bits during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">recent open beta</a>. Oh, and showing off their campaign's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">rampant helicopter destruction</a>, lest we forget the great sacrifice of those poor metal birds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In that <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing">blog post</a>, EA insist their battle royale'll still be plenty Battlefieldy, since it doesn't ditch the gadgets, explosives, environmental destruction, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/better-for-battlefield-6-vehicles-to-start-off-too-weak-says-producer-to-players-sore-about-tooled-up-engineers">vehicles</a> you usually have at your disposal in field battles. There'll be 100 players crammed into a specially built new map, armed with "two default gadgets" their chosen class to kick off the hunting for loot and experience points. Oh, and obviously the killing, can't forget about that.</p>
<p>Enveloping this gaggle is the usual battle royale contracting boundary, but EA claim to not have settled for any old harmful circle, as they outline below:</p>
<blockquote>We set out to bring the most dangerous ring in gaming to Battle Royale that instantly kills players upon contact. With urgent warnings as the fire approaches, soldiers will be pushed into more intense firefights as the game space continues to shrink. There’s no jumping in and out of it, no using it for cover, no walking through it - if you get caught in it, you are done. We’re excited to see how the ring affects the pace of the game and how it creates spontaneous showdowns.</blockquote>
<p>Jiminy crickets, a brim of bad times so deadly you've got to describe it like an obstacle from the classic children's tale We're Going on a Bear Hunt. I like the idea of instant murder over a countdown or gradual damage in theory, though that'll probably go out of the window the moment I'm a bit too slow to migrate towards the middle of the map melee.</p><p>Another detail worth noting is the makeup of the goodies players'll be able to grab during these fights. "There are five tiers of weapons to loot along with attachments, throwables (Ex. Frag Grenades), gadgets (Ex. RPGs), Strike Packages (Ex. Air Strike), armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorited weapons," EA outline. The mode also packs support class revives and "mobile redeploy options" that can bring you back if you snuff it because you've been blasted into oblivion while trying to snag your most beloved of bullet-dealers.</p>
<p>The battle royale testing is set to begin at some point this week, and you can sign-up to be given access <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">here</a> if this'll be your first jaunt into Labs ahead of Battlefield 6's release on October 10th.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a new PlayStation Family App on iOS and Android, giving you more - and more immediate - control over a number of aspects of your child's gaming.</p>
<p>What catches my eye is the ability to manage how much time a child is spending on their PlayStation machine, and to do it dynamically. This means your child has a time balance per day to play, which you can up or down whenever you wish, and you can see how much they have used in real-time. They can even pitch you for more playtime via the app, so you don't even need to talk to them! You need only approve or decline.</p>

<p>Also useful: real-time notifications that show what they're playing, spending controls, customisable content filtering, and managing access to social features. And graphs, which are always useful, I think.</p>
<p>"We're excited to bring an easy way for parents to manage their children's gaming directly from their mobile devices," said Sony on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/announcing-playstation-family-app-for-parental-controls-and-family-management/">the PlayStation Blog.</a> "This is just the beginning with our new mobile app – we'll plan to continue adding enhancements to the PlayStation Family app to evolve the experience over time."</p>

IP lawyers, too, have criticized the development. IP expert <a href="https://x.com/Florian4Gamers/status/1965991376681664655" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florian Mueller took to social media</a> to say Nintendo “should never” have received a "summon character and let it fight" patent in the first place, while video game patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/an-embarrassing-failure-of-the-us-patent-system-videogame-ip-lawyer-says-nintendos-latest-patents-on-pokemon-mechanics-should-not-have-happened-full-stop/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> "these claims were in no way allowable."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">These types of patents are too often used in bad faith <a href="https://t.co/89972KD6NB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/89972KD6NB</a></p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1965722965636776444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">According to Mueller, the problem is global. “The Japan Patent Office also granted Nintendo an outrageous patent,” he said. “They ‘amended’ one of the patents they're using against Palworld in Japan. Outrageous stuff.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> the patent will likely be ignored. "I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art," he said: "This isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also now owns U.S. Patent No. 12,409,387, which relates to the "smooth switching of riding objects" mechanism.

The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office (JPO): two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment.

We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

But there's one section of the game that is proving to be particularly devious.</p>
<p>Before we go ahead, please note that although this article won't cover anything related to Silksong's story, we will be <strong>spoiling a key gameplay surprise</strong> that you might want to discover for yourself. If you'd like to maintain the mystery, consider coming back at a later date.</p>
<p>So essentially, as covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-traumatized-hunters-march-bench-trap/">The Gamer</a>, a single bench located in Hunter's March – one of the most demanding areas of the game, no less – doesn't offer the usual respite that you might expect. Instead, sitting on it (and keep in mind the usual 'Rest' prompt will still pop up) will actually trigger a deadly trap, causing spikes to swing down from the right and, should be low on health, kill you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qtirvp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Such_Food4915/">Such_Food4915</a> highlighted this with a simple caption that states "i have no words. this is the most anger i have ever felt for any game ever. i had one mask".</p>

<p>Similarly, X user <a href="https://x.com/DazrTheKing">Dazr</a> has posted a video showcasing exactly what the bench in question will do should you sit in it. <strong>Last warning if you're still here</strong>, this will show you everything:</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind for us when looking at this is that it's remarkably similar to how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> played a mean trick on gamers with the Mimic enemy. These things disguise themselves as chests which, when opening, triggers a pretty devastating attack.</p>
<p>It's a pretty clever – albeit naughty – way to lull players into a false sense of security, and it shifts your mindset going forwards. Nothing is truly safe within the world of Silksong, and you'd best keep your wits about you at all times.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> contains what could be a cheeky reference to this year's prior headline success story from a smaller developer, Sandfall Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Are you playing Team Cherry's new metroidvania? Here's how to find that Easter egg. Beware mild area and equipment spoilers from this point on.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Briefly, you'll need to head west of Wormways and play your needolin at the nearby Weavenest Karn. Alas, you might need to cough up 500 rosaries for a Simple Key in order to access the place, if you haven't already. The needolin, for context, is a musical instrument that sometimes reveals apparitions and other ghostly activity, when plucked in the right area - read our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong walkthrough</a> hub for more. In this case, Hornet's lonely ditty will trigger some phantom text about sleep and entrapment, which includes the phrase "for those who come after".
</p>
<p>
We first <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q1cQyr5">learned of this</a> from Reddit, spawning ground for any and all videogame Easter egg reports and also, any number of fakes. Our James then dug out his savegame from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a> and confirmed that the sequence is real.
</p>
<p>
"For those who come after" is the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWate4IdV7M">a beloved orchestral track from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. It's a key phrase in the game's story, uttered by characters laying down their lives in the quest to stop the Paintress. It's also, of course, a fairly everyday bit of writing, the kind of line that adorns many a memorial work, and the reference could be accidental. But the shared musical context inclines me to believe that Team Cherry intended the connection.
</p><p>
I do hope it's intentional. I love this kind of embedded compliment. It reminds me of when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> devs wrote a whole in-game skit about hairdryers to express their fondness for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/alien-isolation-preview">Cara Ellison's Guardian preview</a>. (My equivalent for that is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> devs derisively including my Eurogamer "Avoid" in their accolades trailer.)</p>
<p>I also very much like that the apparent link is revealed through music, as though Hornet's soulful string-plucking had flittered across the void of commerce and raised an echo from the art nouveau necropolis of Expedition 33. There you are, I've overegged the pudding now.
</p>
<p>
Sandfall Interactive appear fond of Silksong themselves - they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1ndhpxh/expedition_33_devs_celebrating_silksong/">posted some congratulatory art</a> featuring Hornet and Clair Obscur's Maelle. Let's see if the good vibes persist come GOTY voting time.
</p>
<p>Silksong's other secrets include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-out-hollow-knight-silksongs-hiding-a-sneaky-stardew-valley-creatorman-cameo">a mystery cameo from Eric Barone, creator of Stardew Valley</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-hollow-knight-silksong-does-have-another-difficulty-mode-just-not-the-one-you-probably-want">hidden mode that probably isn't the kind you're hoping for</a>. I think it's safe to say that there's much else to discover.</p>

It's not really about finding the perfect slot on the calendar—there are no concerns about profits and losses related to, say, missing a Christmas window—but about finding the ideal spot for the team that's building the game, and then working within that window to make sure their title isn't fighting with a juggernaut like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/compulsion-games-boss-tells-brazilian-devs-to-bake-discoverability-into-the-bedrock-of-their-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Compulsion Games boss tells Brazilian devs to bake discoverability into the bedrock of their games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Flexibility makes it easier, perhaps, to pivot or delay if needed.

"We picked the original release date of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Demonschool</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;as September 3 because if [Team Cherry] were to drop a megaton announcement at Gamescom or PAX [...] it wouldn't be ideal, but it's a little bit outside of the blast radius," said Kwek, who estimated the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;studio would make its release date announcement around three or four weeks before launch.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;You're essentially gambling with someone's livelihood&quot;">"You're essentially gambling with someone's livelihood"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Cherry didn't end up announcing the game's release date at Gamescom Opening Night Live. It happened a few days later—and the launch date was just two weeks away. Kwek, with Necrosoft Games, immediately got to work figuring out what to do. Should they stick with September or move to November? The problem with September is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; a direct, big competitor that would certainly eat up people's time.

"Steam, they're probably a little bit more easy going about that sort of thing. Let's just say, the week—the seven days following the announcement of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release date—I think I aged maybe five or six years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release date was announced, Devolver Digital's Lowrie said the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;team reached out: "Hey, I guess we should talk," he said of the call.

The teams pitched around ideas, but Cuzzillo ended up mocking up a version of what would eventually be released, and Boch used&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' complex soundscape as inspiration for the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sounds that play with the video.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It ended up being one of Devolver Digital's most watched videos for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on its channels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, Bloober Team <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/report/espi-30-2025-wyniki-sprzedazy-gry-cronos-the-new-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed with a brief notice</a> that its new sci-fi horror game Cronos: The New Dawn has sold 200K units digitally in the first three days. It's not terrible, but it's not great, either, especially since the game was released on all major platforms, including the record-breaking console Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>It's way too early to spell doom for the Polish studio, anyway. CEO Piotr Babieno told <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-nie-widzi-zagrozenia-dla-Cronos-The-New-Dawn-w-zwiazku-z-debiutem-Hollow-Knight-Silksong-wywiad-9003011.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankier.pl</a> that the budget of Cronos: The New Dawn was lower than estimated by investors, which means it won't take that much to recoup the investment:</p>



<p><em>We also noticed that the costs of creating Cronos: The New Dawn were estimated at over PLN 100 million ($27.4 million). I can assure you that the development budget was certainly not that high, and even though we are counting on very good sales results, the break-even point is not as high as analysts indicate. We are completely confident about the company's investment growth and earnings. All our analyses indicate that things will be fine, but we will of course report on sales levels when we reach significant milestones.</em></p>



<p>Babieno also confirmed that there are no current plans for a sequel, although a transmedia expansion to cinema or TV is certainly possible. On the development side, Bloober is preparing even larger titles for the next couple of years, which Babieno believes will be even better than 2025 for the studio.</p>



<p>For those still on the fence for Cronos: The New Dawn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here's our review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo, who thoroughly enjoyed the experience and rated it 8 out of 10.</p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

            <p>There's another message about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s Coronations DLC for you to read, sire. Developers PDS Black have apologised for the update not being up to par, and issued the first of multiple patches aimed at rectifying its issues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, this add-on fleshes out ascending to the throne in the crown-heavy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game a bit more, as well as letting you set a key goal for your regime. It arrived earlier this week, and the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">quickly sank to mostly negative</a>. The main gripes were buggy oaths - you can swear oaths at the end of coronations, earning rewards if you fulfil your oath on time - and whether gating some relatively small-scale yet significant features behind paid DLC was justified.</p>
<p>Paradox have now responded to that backlash, with a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-1-17-0-1-a-long-overdue-apology.1858561/">statement penned by Riad</a>, a QA manager at Crusader Kings 3 developer PDS Black. Writing that the Coronations wasn't "up to the standard you deserve", the developer continued: "It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly."</p>
<p>According to Riad, the upcoming All Under Heaven DLC, which'll expand the game's map into China, Japan and southeast Asia, has required the vast majority of the studio's attention and resources. As a result, the team working on the smaller Coronations had to get by with "limited resources" and less staff.</p><p>"As a studio, we’re taking a hard look at how we assign resources, and support our developers so that every release meets the expectations you rightfully have," the QA manager wrote. "For example, we will be more stringent about allowing last-minute changes to the game (which can cause issues like broken oaths). We will also ensure that we dedicate more time towards full-length playthroughs throughout the entire development cycle, to ensure that issues like these can’t slip through."</p>
<p>Riad added that it "hurts so much when we fuck up like this", and that the studio will be aiming to earn back the trust of players. That'll likely be a very tall order given that this is hardly a one-off for Paradox. The publishers have acquired a bit of a reputation for regularly releasing DLC which is either <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-releasing-the-worst-reviewed-game-on-steam">low quality</a>, viewed as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">unnecessary extra monetisation</a>, or some combo of the two. The latter's been front and centre recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>'s paid DLC clans, a mess we're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">currently waiting to see the full extent of Paradox's cleanup plans</a> for. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you're ready to trust Paradox again, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> devs have quickly put out a patch aimed at fixing the main issues with Coronations' oaths. Riad also specified that there'll be "at least one more patch" for the DLC coming, "to fix many of the issues we encountered ahead of the release, but didn’t have enough time to fix". You can find the full notes for the first patch, which is out now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991?l=english">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Grit &amp; Valor 1949 is set, fairly obviously in 1949, but it’s not the 1949 that our grandparents experienced. This is an alternate history, and one where WW2 still rages on. It’s also an alternate history drawing on Steampunk ideas and aesthetics, where battlefields clamour with the sounds of mechs and unlikely weaponry. Grit &amp; Valor takes this setting and turns it into a real-time tactical roguelite, fusing ideas from games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/31/into-the-breach-review/">Into The Breach</a> with small scale RTS games like Bad North into a new, mostly cohesive, whole.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grit and Valor - 1949 | Official Console Launch Trailer: XBOX X|S and PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sv2Cs_oZhl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re part of the Resistance, fighting back against the evil Axis from a small island outpost off the coast of Scotland. Your task is to liberate each region from its Axis occupiers, forcing them from the British Isles, back into France and Western Europe, before finally facing the enemy’s seat of power in New Germany. Each area has multiple stages, and multiple pathways through which, as this is a roguelite, you’ll be hoping to pick up the best enhancements along the way.</p>


<p>The tutorial is suspiciously straightforward, and extremely quick before sending you over the top into live combat. While you move around each battlefield by stomping through a fixed grid, you don’t select individual targets for regular attacks; instead, you rely on your mechs targeting the nearest villain in their sights.</p>
<p>Just like Fire Emblem, there’s a weapon triangle at work here to distinguish who will have the upper hand, so Ballistic Class is strong against Fire, Fire is strong against Explosives, and Explosives beat out Ballistics.</p>


<p>Each Mech has a different class then, but also its own pilot, with each driver having their own special ability to help you out in the field. Archie Miller, the chap in control during the tutorial, has a Jump Jet ability that lets you leap across the battlefield and cause damage to enemies in a wide area, while Emilia Rochefort can heal her Mech. The third starting pilot, Jan Nowak, can lay traps, leaving mines in the path of advancing enemy vehicles. You need to know when to deploy these skills, not least because they have a limited number of uses, and they’ll often mean the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>During each battle, there are crate drops containing enhancements for your mechs. Each crate gives you three options to choose from, with different levels of rarity denoting the most powerful or unique abilities. You might also pick up repair packs here, letting you regain some health for one of your team, while you steadily try to create an arsenal that will see you through to the very end.</p>
<p>That’s unlikely to happen in one run. As you fight you’re also earning currency to spend on permanent upgrades, and it’s these that will fundamentally raise your chances of success.</p>

<p>There’s a lot going on in Grit &amp; Valor’s diorama-like levels. You have to juggle grabbing objectives, taking cover, protecting your Command unit, and taking out the Axis forces, all the while making sure you’ve got the best matchups going on through the weapon triangle. As it takes place in real time, it can be a little chaotic, and while the pad controls do a good job, I can’t help but feel that a mouse makes these things easier. Now, if they happen to drop a Switch 2 patch with mouse support, that might be the perfect answer.</p>
<p>It’s all a lot of fun though. While the game on Switch isn’t as detailed or high resolution as on other platforms, I still appreciate the Steampunk comic-like visuals. The action is easy to parse, but challenging, and there’s a clear sense of progression, as every run grants you new Mechs, new parts or the ability to upgrade something that will make your life easier next time out. It’s fast-paced and it doesn’t waste your time, and as a Switch game, it’s an ideal title to pick up and play, get a run in, or a couple of stages within one, and then head off to do something else.</p>

<p>There were a couple of times where the game crashed while playing, with it soft-locking in the menus and preventing me from advancing. However, a quick reset let me progress, and it didn’t get in the way of things too much – it’s possible that it might have been an oddity compatibility support when playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>By its very nature, Grit &amp; Valor becomes quite repetitive. It’s carried through by your steadily expanding arsenal and abilities, and that search for an ideal run into enemy territory, but you have to be completely sold on the fundamental gameplay early on. Personally, I think it pulls it off, with the visuals and alternate history setting really drawing me in, but I could see some players losing faith with the repetition and chaos-tinged battles.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-high-difficulty-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> yesterday, FromSoftware has now released a free update for Elden Ring Nightreign, adding the brand new Deep of Night mode to the game.</p>



<p>This was designed as an endgame challenge for experienced players. Deep of Night can hide the Nightlord and Shifting Earth from players until battle begins. Enemies across Limveld will be more challenging, and random enemies will be mutated, potentially presenting greater dangers to players, who, however, can oppose these strengthened foes with new weapon enhancements. Beware, though, as some of these weapon enhancements could also have detrimental effects, such as increasing the amount of damage players take. </p>



<p>Players must be highly selective if they hope to survive the night and ultimately defeat the Nightlord. Three new relic slots have been introduced exclusively for Depths Relics, a new reward players can earn while playing the Deep of Night game mode. These Depths Relics can provide powerful enhancements, but, as with the new variant weapons, they also come at a cost. Victory will require skillful calculation and execution. Deep of Night mode is meant explicitly for the bravest Nightfarers, providing an extreme challenge and showing players the darkest depths of the game, including the dreadful possibility of unknowingly facing an Everdark Sovereign Nightlord.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is the latest in a series of successful game releases by FromSoftware. While not quite as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold five million units in the first month of its release</a>. Meanwhile, the Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree reached 10 million units.</p>



<p>Even Hollywood noticed the franchise's popularity. In late May, a live-action film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>; it will be produced by A24 and Bandai Namco. Alex Garland, the man behind 28 Days Later, Dredd, Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, and Warfare, is attached to direct and write the script. </p>

      </div>
<p>EA has also made some changes to the game's ranked competitive Road to the College Football Playoffs mode, to make the experience feel more competitive and reward skilled play. All players will now earn more Rank Points overall, especially in lower divisions, which will be balanced by a lower starting rank. Some players may find their ranks moved down as a result of the update. EA is also making improvements to playoff qualifications to reward strong performance, as well as making win modifiers like Away wins or lower-tier victories more significant.</p><p>Alongside the many gameplay updates, fixes, and improvements, CFB26 will also get some updates to the aesthetics and feel of the game. There are over 30 new additions in equipment and uniforms, including some teams' new season uniforms that didn't make it in in time for the game's launch. As the video game evolves to match the real college football season, EA is also adding over 50 new audio commentary intros for rivalry games, covering some of the 2025 season's most anticipated matchups.</p><p>As a last little bonus in this title update, CFB26 is getting a handful of new marching band pop covers, including contemporary pop hits like Apple and Espresso, as well as some older favorites including Misery Business and Get Lucky.</p><p>Check out everything that's new, changed, and fixed in the September 11 College Football 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/campus-huddle-title-update-september-11th?utm_campaign=cf26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_cfb26-title-update-4&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=86084&amp;ts=1757570124033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">title update</a> below:</p><h2>College Football 26 Title Update September 11th</h2><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Pass Blocking &amp; Pass Rush</h3><ul><li>Added option to set Base Protection by default.</li><li><strong>DEV NOTE:</strong> <em>For players who don’t want built-in pass protections on passing plays, we have included a new Coaching Adjustment to allow players to elect Base Protection as the default protection for all dropback passing plays.

This prevents scenarios where players could reach the playoffs with a losing record in lower divisions.</li><li><strong>Division Rank Adjustments:</strong> If you’re currently in one of the affected divisions, your rank may be moved down to reflect the new starting points until you begin your next season.</li><li><strong>Improved Playoff Qualification:</strong> These changes ensure that strong performance is rewarded, especially in higher divisions. Previously, playing mostly Tier 1 matchups could make it difficult to reach the playoffs even with a great record.</li><li><strong>Win Modifiers Matter More:</strong> The base Rank Points for a win are increased, making modifiers like Away wins or victories as a lower tier team even more valuable.</li><li><strong>No Change to Win Requirements:</strong> The number of wins needed to move up or stay in a division remains the same.</li><li><strong>More Time to Compete:</strong> Based on player feedback, we are making all RTCFP games 4 minutes a quarter vs 3 minutes so that you have enough time to overcome Home Field Advantage.</li></ul><h2>Why Are We Making These Changes?</h2><p>Our goal is to make playoff qualification more competitive and rewarding, while ensuring that every win counts—especially in tougher matchups. These updates will help create a more balanced and exciting Road to the College Football Playoffs experience.</p><h2>Presentation</h2><h3>Equipment</h3><p><strong>New Equipment Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>6 New Axiom Masks</li><li>Adidas Ultra Boost Mono Cleats</li><li>Adidas Adizero Electric 2 Exotic Speed Cleats</li></ul><p><strong>New Uniforms &amp; Uniform Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>Air Force Space Force Alternate Uniform</li><li>Central Michigan University Sleeve Numbers</li><li>East Carolina University Purple Fleck Helmet</li><li>Florida International University Vice City 2023 Uniform</li><li>Fresno State Camouflage Helmet</li><li>Fresno State White USA Helmet</li><li>Mississippi State 2023 Throwback Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State Black Alternate Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State White Interlocking Helmet</li><li>Old Dominion University Blue Helmet</li><li>Oregon State Camouflage Uniform</li><li>Sam Houston State Home Jersey</li><li>San Diego State University New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of Alabama at Birmingham New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of California Paw Print Helmets</li><li>University of Kansas Blue Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Kansas White Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Louisiana at Monroe Black Alternate Helmet</li><li>University of Nebraska Black Uniforms</li><li>University of Nebraska Blackshirts (2020) Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico Red Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of New Mexico Turquoise Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico White Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of Virginia Stars and Stripes Helmet</li><li>University of Washington 2022 White and Gold Set</li><li>University of Washington Throwback Uniform</li><li>Western Michigan Bumpers</li><li>Names now appear on the New Mexico State University Crimson, Black, and White Jerseys</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><p>We hope you’ve enjoyed the Pop Song Covers that were part of our original launch.

"They then promptly tell on themselves across social media, asking 'Why did this happen?'"</p><p>"These are our mitigations at work, ramped up and powered by new detection systems that have been extremely effective at disrupting bad actors in real-time," continued the developer. "We don't hit every cheater with these mitigations; most are banned upon detection. But in August alone, over 55,000 cheaters were disrupted by Call of Duty's mitigations."</p><p>After nerfing cheaters in action, the developer collects info about the users and permanently ban them.

            <p>
Nintendo has been granted a new patent in the US, following its ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair.
</p>
<p>
The new patent, granted last week by the US Patent and Trademark Office, covers the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to let it fight another. The patent application was filed in March 2023 and has been granted without objection (thanks <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Games Fray</a>).
</p>
<p>
Such a patent would not only implicate Palworld with its monster summoning and battling, but many similar games from long-standing rival Digimon, to the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-nexus-anima-revealed-a-spin-off-creature-collector-from-genshin-impact-studio">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> and DokeV, as well as indies like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/temtem">Temtem</a> and Cassette Beasts.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of steps in the patent pertaining to the gameplay mechanic, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</li>
<li>performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</li>
<li>performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</li>
<li>when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</li>
<li>when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</li>
<li>performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>
All of these steps must be followed for Nintendo to have a case, but in theory it could launch an infringement lawsuit against a number of games with this patent now in place.
</p>
<p>But is this patent enforceable through further lawsuits from Nintendo?</p>
<p>
Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, believes the patent will likely be ignored. "I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art," he told Eurogamer, adding: "This isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens">Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</a>".</p><p>"The filing for such patent protection indicates that Nintendo does intend to pursue a legal strategy in defending itself against entrants in the pocket monster genre," games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer. "But that strategy may or may not involve lawsuits, as the 'muddying of the waters' effected by the patents existence may be enough to deter investment in and creation of competitors.  That is, if Nintendo looks like it <em>could</em> pounce, that may be enough. No actual pouncing required."</p>
<p>What's more, the patent is broad and Nintendo won't want to jeopardise seeing it narrowed in the context of a legal challenge, Hoeg explained.</p>
<p>"So yes, it's enforceable in so far as it has been granted," said Hoeg, "but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>What's more worrying for Hoeg is whether the USPTO is "up to the task" when it comes to games patents. "Law and technology are often strange bedfellows, and in my opinion the patent office has appeared out of its depth on evaluating video games for quite some time," said Hoeg. "It may be time for reform there."</p>
<p>
At the least, the patent is certainly worrying for the games industry in the face of creativity and developer freedom.
</p>
<p>
Already Pocketpair has altered gameplay in Palworld as part of its ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">disputing the claims of copyright infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>The patent is also well-timed ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Nintendo's forthcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, due out on 16th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' DLC Claws of Awaji will be ready to dive into very soon, and in anticipation Ubisoft is issuing a new update for the base game.</p>
<p>This update, which is scheduled to go live later today, will include a level cap increase, upgrades for your hideout, the ability to fast-forward the time of day (hurrah!) and new Ezio themed Project Rewards.</p>
<p>As for Claws of Awaji, that's coming on 16th September, as paid DLC (though those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows will get it for free). On its release, Claws of Awaji will introduce a new region, a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. The expansion is said to be adding over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>

<p><strong>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New expansion: Claws of Awaji </li>
</ul>
<p>A storm is coming.</p>
<p>A new threat rises from across Osaka Bay as rumors surface of a hidden blade wielding shinobi, and of a long-lost relic. Naoe and Yasuke journey to a new land in search of answers, but find themselves surrounded by danger, ensnared in the Claws of Awaji.</p>
<p>In this expansion to Assassin's Creed Shadows, discover a new island region dominated by the Sanzoku Ippa, a nefarious faction intent on uncovering the final Regalia. Avoid traps and ambushes as you track the legendary Fujibayashi Tsuyu, and as Naoe, master the new Bo staff to eliminate enemies with tactical efficiency. New legendary gear, skills and abilities also await across more than 10 hours of additional content.</p>
<p><em>We also would like to inform MacOS users eligible for the Claws of Awaji DLC that the content may not be accessible immediately after launching the game for the first time following the release of the DLC.</em></p>
<p><em>To resolve this, please launch the game while connected online, then close it and reboot—either online or offline—to ensure the DLC becomes available.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>New free story quest: Go with the Bo</li>
</ul>
<p>Join Junjiro in his quest to meet a legendary Bo Master and learn more about the Bo staff, a dynamic new weapon type perfectly suited to Naoe's acrobatic fighting style. Upon finishing the quest, you will receive a Bo to use across your adventures.</p>
<p>Originally developed exclusively for the Claws of Awaji expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone... for FREE! You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16th.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level Cap Increase</li>
</ul>
<p>To support the launch of the Claws of Awaji expansion we've raised the level cap to 100, giving players more room to grow and more options to customize their builds.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Hideout Upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new update, each unique building now includes two additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside three new Hideout levels.</p>
<p>These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance Time of Day</li>
</ul>
<p>By upgrading the Nando to level two, the player will gain the ability to meditate and skip time forward to the next 6 o'clock (AM or PM). To activate meditation, find a safe location and hold the up button (L on keyboard). This allows Naoe and Yasuke to prepare for nighttime assault and be ready to strike [#@!%&amp;*] Castle at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Scouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading the Study to level four now allows Scouts to reveal both Viewpoints and Safehouses. Discovering Safehouses is especially valuable, as it enables Naoe and Yasuke to join the action more quickly by reducing their travel time.</p>
<p>And with the Kakurega upgraded to level four, uncovering all Viewpoints within a province will also reveal the entire province automatically, giving players full visibility of its terrain and strategic locations. No more fog!</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Gear Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>By upgrading the Forge to level six, Naoe and Yasuke gain the ability to enhance their gear to new quality tiers: Mythic and Artifact. Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential.</p>
<p>Epic items can be transformed into Mythic items, which improve their stats with each level, add a Boosted Stat if one wasn't present, and boost non-legendary perks, including the one in the engraving slot, by 50 percent at level five and 100 percent at level nine. (For perks related to damage reduction, refill ration, ammo, or tools, this bonus is halved, capping at a 50 percent increase at level nine.)</p>
<p>Legendary items, on the other hand, can evolve into Artifact items, which not only increase their stats with each level but also receive additional Boosted Stats at levels three, seven, and twice at level nine. Engraved non-legendary perks are also boosted like the Mythic items.</p>
<p>These powerful enhancements are designed as long-term goals, supporting players through the increasing difficulty of subsequent New Game+ cycles and other upcoming challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Project: Sanctuary</li>
</ul>
<p>We are releasing a new Project available in the Animus HUB, called Sanctuary, in which you can get Ezio themed gear, kusarigama, and much more! Activate the new Project, complete Anomalies and progress through the rewards like previously released ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Anomalies in Awaji</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of the Claws of Awaji expansion, we added new Anomalies available in that region, with one available in every schedule. These Anomalies are only available for players who have the expansion installed.</p>

<p>Ubisoft recently celebrated welcoming five million players to Assassin's Creed Shadows. Along with those five million assassins, at the time there had also been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March. And it sounds like Assassin's Creed Shadows may soon be welcoming more players to Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">with a Switch 2 port seemingly being on the cards</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-launches-november-4-powered-unity/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-launches-on-november-4-powered-by-unity-and-featuring-big-improvements.1294416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SEGA and Sports Interactive have unveiled Football Manager 26 and its release date. The football management simulation game will be released on November 4 on PC and Mac, while Football Manager 26 Console launches simultaneously on Xbox Series S|X, Xbox One, and PlayStation 5. FM26 and FM 26 Console will be available on PC and Xbox, respectively, to Game Pass subscribers on day one. November 4 will also mark the debut of Football Manager 26 Mobile as a Netflix exclusive. Lastly, Football Manager 2026 Touch will be released one month later digitally for the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>You may recall that last year's edition, Football Manager 25, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch on November 26</a> but was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> to double down on creating a better version for this year. Well, at least on paper, it appears to have paid off as there's a laundry list of new features.</p>



<p>Chiefly, there is the engine switch from Sports Interactive's proprietary engine to the widely used Unity engine. This allows for a much greater level of fidelity when spectating matches than before, thanks to new volumetric animations from real-life matches. Despite the engine change, FM26, FM26 Console, and FM26 Touch will all launch with save game compatibility for Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023.</p>



<p>The dated user interface has been refreshed to give players greater control and influence over make-or-break decisions in every career. Designed to be more intuitive for everyone from newcomers to veterans, the Football Manager 26 User Interface supports improvements in tactics, scouting, and recruitment. Another big addition is the long-awaited arrival of Women’s Football, which is seamlessly integrated into the FM ecosystem thanks to the most comprehensive database of its kind and a host of licensed competitions that Sports Interactive and SEGA will reveal in the weeks ahead of November 4. Authenticity has been further enhanced, too, with the newly licensed Premier League taking the spotlight in this regard. </p>

<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said: </p>



<p><em>I’m honoured and delighted to be revealing Football Manager 26’s release date today. Setting Sports Interactive up for the next twenty years and beyond was an enormous undertaking but I couldn’t be prouder of the efforts of the whole team over the past two years. FM26 represents a landmark release in our quest to produce football management perfection and the whole studio is really excited to share it with the world.</em></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 can be pre-ordered now at £49.99/€59.99/$59.99, although select digital retailers provide a 10% discount. Lastly, PC and Mac users who pre-order through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/football-manager-26-080e85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> can look forward to two weeks of advanced access to the game.</p>

                <p>College football players who lent their names and likenesses to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/" data-ref-id="1900-6418261">EA Sports College Football 25</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football 26</a> reportedly received a pay bump from $600 to $1,500 per player. However, that may not be enough for players when EA begins putting together the deals for College Football 27.</p><p>According to <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/group-that-facilitated-nil-deal-for-football-video-game-now-says-its-not-enough/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Front Office Sports</a>, the issue at hand is revenue sharing. EA's Madden NFL and other pro sports games include players when dividing the revenue. However, EA's deal for the College Football games only included extra payments if the athletes appeared on the cover or if they were involved with the marketing of the game.</p><p>FOS notes that EA also left out the language in the contract that allowed college players to opt out of the deal, but the company told Front Office Sports that players can still do so if they contact EA directly. OneTeam Partners--the organization that worked with EA to line up the college players--has shared a statement calling for revenue sharing in the next installment of the series.</p><p>"OneTeam does not dictate the terms of the NIL agreements between college players and EA," a OneTeam spokesperson told FOS. "The decision to remain silent on the opt-out was EA's unilateral choice. We continue to work with EA to influence its NIL License agreement, but these changes were implemented by EA ... The higher payouts in this year's title show the progress, but it's not enough. We continue to advocate for meaningful revenue sharing for college athletes from all partners."</p><p>Earlier this year, Pathway Sports and Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">reached out to college players directly</a> for their name, image, and likeness rights for $1,500, which was the rate EA reportedly ended up paying for College Football 26. Since there isn't a union for college athletes, neither OneTeam nor Pathway Sports can negotiate deals on behalf of all college players.</p><p>The report adds that OneTeam objected to EA's terms for this year's College Football 26, but was contractually obligated to present those deals to the athletes as written. Without a union in their corner, college football players may not have the leverage to get revenue sharing from EA in the immediate future.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-gets-official-details-testing-starts-this-week-on-bf-labs.1294395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, the Battlefield 6 development team <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> the long-rumored (and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-map-leaked-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a>) Battle Royale mode, which will begin testing this week via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs platform</a>. The goal is to infuse this highly popular game mode with Battlefield DNA, including destructible environments, classes, and more.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the map has been designed specifically for the Battle Royale experience. It features a diverse array of tactical points of interest, each with a distinct layout and theme that offers unique gameplay opportunities. During a Battle Royale match, players can find common vehicles around the map and eventually unlock powerful armored vehicles. The goal is to provide users with more ways to traverse the map early in a match and create interesting combined arms action, again playing to the trademark strength of the Battlefield franchise.</p>



<p>Destruction will include anything from creating pathways through walls all the way to toppling whole buildings, which is definitely something other Battle Royale games don't really have. The initial test will host a hundred players split into twenty-five squads of four, each vying to be the last squad standing. Communication tools include text, VoIP, and pings. To keep their squad alive, players can count on the Support class's revives and the Mobile Redeploy option.</p>



<p>The Battle Royale subgenre's defining feature is the ever-shrinking 'circle'. In Battlefield's twist, this will be a fire ring that instantly kills anything it touches, pushing players to always be inside it at a safe distance. In most other games of this kind, the circle merely damages players at a not-so-deadly rate, which players sometimes exploit to go around enemies and kill them. </p>



<p>Ahead of a Battlefield Battle Royale match, each squad selects the classes, another distinguishing feature compared to most games. The chosen class is not changeable during the matches. Players begin with two default gadgets from their class and level up during each match; XP is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Intel Cases will be a particularly juicy target since they provide experience to the whole squad. Leveling up a class provides access to new traits. For example, the Assault class can equip an armor plate faster.</p>



<p>Throughout a Battlefield Battle Royale match, players explore the map, complete missions, and battle for loot. There will be five rarity tiers of weapons to loot, as well as attachments, throwables, gadgets, strike packages, armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorite weapons. These items can be found in general or class-specific loot crates, by unlocking armored trucks, through mission rewards, or by looting defeated enemies.</p>



<p>The game will constantly assign missions to squads, asking them to complete objectives that offer extra rewards, giving them a competitive edge over their opponents. Tasks range from unlocking high-value caches to planting explosives to eliminate mission-critical targets. Mission details will include the available rewards, such as a weapons cache, vehicle key, or mobile redeploy unit. Once the mission objective is complete, the rewards are airdropped in, which means other squads may swoop in and steal them if those who earned the rewards aren't careful.</p>



<p>While the developers are focused on delivering the core Battlefield 6 experience first on October 10, it is clear that a well-received Battle Royale mode could make all the difference in reaching <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA's lofty goal of 100 million players</a>. Once ready, this mode might be released as a standalone and free experience, just like Warzone is to Call of Duty, but it's too early to say for sure at this stage.</p>

            <p>Early start today! One of those mornings where my mind woke up before my body. We're back with another day of video games, gathering all of the news and events here, while talking about them with you.</p>
<p>By the way, thank you for your feedback yesterday. We're gathering it to help shape and drive change.</p>
<p>But onto today, and a question that formed in my brain this morning, while sipping coffee and looking at my dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> beside my television. How many of you are using your Switch 2? Does it get frequent use or occasional use? Or, perhaps, none at all.</p>

<p>The Japanese video game company Sunsoft (known for releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/blaster_master">Blaster Master</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ufouria_the_saga">Ufouria</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/trip_world">Trip World</a>) is teasing something big...</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/sunsoftgames/status/1965958472945565993">brief post on social media today</a>, it revealed plans to share some important news.
