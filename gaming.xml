			<p>Sony has released Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC without too much fanfare. The system requirements were only <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a couple of days ago, way later than usual, and the launch experience leaves more than something to be desired, which was a bit surprising since the port was handled by the usually very competent Nixxes Software.</p>
<p>The biggest issue that is driving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam user reviews way down</a> (only 55% are positive at the time of writing) is the crashing. The game often crashes, as I experienced myself, with the following error message:</p>
<p><em>A problem has occurred with your display driver. This can be caused by out of date drivers, using game settings higher than your GPU can handle, an overheating GPU (current GPU temperature: 70 Celsius), or an error with the game. Please try updating your graphics drivers, or lowering your in-game settings. Current GPU and graphics driver: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 572.16 </em><br>
<em>(0x887A0006: DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG).&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-30-200037-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, 70° Celsius is definitely not a possible cause for GPU overheating; the drivers are the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-572-16-driver-available-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-dlss-4-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published just yesterday by NVIDIA;</a> and there's no way the problem would be too high in-game settings with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Clearly, the issue is related to the game itself, as evidenced by the fact that many users have reported it across wildly differing PC configurations.</p>
<p>Since we mentioned graphics settings, let's take a look at what's available in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture Quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Texture Filtering (up to 16x Anisotropic)</li>
<li>Shadow Quality (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Depth of Field (up to High)</li>
<li>Level of Detail (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Traffic Density (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Crowd Density (up to Ultra)</li>
<li>Hair Quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Screen Space Reflections (up to High)</li>
<li>Weather particle quality (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced reflections (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced interiors (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Ray traced ambient occlusion (up to Very High)</li>
<li>Raytracing object range (a slider that goes up to 10)</li>
<li>DLSS Ray Reconstruction (Legacy, which means CNN, or Transformer)</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-30-185225.png"></a></figure>

<p>The biggest surprise is the inclusion of the latest transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which greatly improves the ray tracing quality. Menno Bil, Graphics Programmer at Nixxes, said about the feature:</p>
<p><em>In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PC with ray reconstruction enabled, we see more detailed ray-traced reflections and better-defined ray-traced shadows, especially when viewing raytracing effects at steep angles. We also see improvements in the ray-traced interiors and less ghosting and noise in the ray-traced ambient occlusion.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve included two models of NVIDIA’s Ray Reconstruction, the original model introduced in DLSS 3.5 and a newly improved model designed for RTX 40 series GPUs and newer. This new model results in an overall more temporally stable image, further improving the visual quality of raytracing</em></p>
<p>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for the time being.</p>
<p>As you can read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my original review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>, the game itself is well worth waiting for the fixes, though.</p>

			<p>The rumors were circulating for a little while that MultiVersus may be on death's door, as the game wasn't performing how they wanted it to. Today, it's been confirmed by the team working on MultiVersus that it will, in fact, be closing its doors on the fighting game for the "foreseeable future." The announcement was <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1885327981758865568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1885327981758865568%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a>, with the comments expressing their sadness and disappointment but also stating that they weren't surprised. While they added new characters for people to experiment with, the game wasn't well optimized, with the menus being incredibly laggy. Players felt that the team didn't support the game enough and that it was at its prime during the Beta test. Between the Beta test and the official release, a lot changed, and it wasn't for the better. While there were people regularly playing the title, the interaction with MultiVersus dropped considerably.</p>
<p>For those who want to get involved with the final season, Season 5 of MultiVersus will begin on February 4 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM GMT and will end on May 30 at the same time. Despite the game ending for the foreseeable, Season 5 will still have a 70-tier Battle Pass, as well as Aquaman and Lola Bunny being added as new playable characters to the game. However, none of the MultiVersus content that is being added in Season 5 will be paid for with real money. It is now all earned by playing the game.</p>
<p>As of today, real money transactions are no longer available. However, if you still have unused Gleamium or character tokens, you can use them to purchase in-game content until the end of Season 5. Once the season ends, the game will no longer be available online, and it won't be able to be downloaded on any storefront. However, the game will still be available to play after the online features are gone, as there will be solo vs AI options, or you can play with up to three other players in person.</p>
<p>If you want to play MultiVersus, you will need to make sure to create an account before Season 5 ends on May 30. Additionally, if you delete or uninstall the game before the end of Season 5, you will be able to reinstall after May 30.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are no announcements or updates given on what will happen to the development team, but with there now being no game to work on, it is likely there will be layoffs or a closure of the studio. Along with this, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO</a> left the company last week after the failure of both Suicide Squad and MultiVersus.</p>

		<p><em> A bunch of speculative money in the world of AI was lost this week. Boo hoo?</em></p><p><em>But it's also undeniable that AI, a term that has in many ways lost any and all meaning, will be a major part of the coming years. Its loss of meaning matters not. It might very well go the way of crypto, but for the moment, it's inescapable.</em></p><p><em>How do you handle your children interacting with AI videos? What will it mean for young people to enter an internet full of lies and, as the headline implies, slop?</em></p><p><em>Naturally, Rob and Patrick have some thoughts.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Rob, it was a little strange to watch the headlines this week about billions in market capital disappearing and simply blink. It appears the next century will not necessarily be dominated by Silicon Valley guys who love to align with fascists while chatting on podcasts!</p><p>Who could’ve thought?</p><p>I blinked because it’s been strange to watch the “AI revolution”—an endless, accelerated stream of hype, money, discourse—and feel so utterly disconnected. Besides ire at its obvious potential and material impacts on labor and art, it often feels like a situation where I’m being <em>told</em> my life is going to change. No. If you buy the arguments, <em>has</em> changed. The way Apple pitches its ludicrous Apple Intelligence makes it sound like the world is already shifted, when in reality what they’re pitching are notification summaries that mostly suck. I’m trying to figure out the FOMO!</p><p>I have, on occasion, asked ChatGTP a basic history question out of curiosity. It seemed fine. <em>Seemed</em> fine. But I lump ChatGPT in the same bucket as the dreadful “AI” summaries that you find while doing a Google search these days. Consulting ChatGTP about a sports question, though, is a choice. Google’s AI summaries are not, and busted as they might be, I have found myself defaulting to scanning them for information because they take up the most important real estate that Google has: the first thing you look at when a search has gone through. I hate it.</p><p>Can I tell you an upsetting story?&nbsp;</p><p>My eight-year-old is in a theater class at the moment and their production is <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em> (My child, bless her heart, swung for the fences to be Dorothy in auditions, but it’s a class for older and younger kids, so she’s a munchkin. Thankfully, she’s very excited to be a munchkin.)</p><p>While picking her up this week, she excitedly asked me “Dad, did you know there’s going to be a sequel to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>?” I blinked, figuring she meant the second <em>Wicked</em> movie that’s coming out this year. All we’ve done lately is listen to the soundtrack and watch inspired dances on TikTok. But before I could ask, her friend came up and gave more details about this sequel.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, this sequel is coming soon “according to a trailer on YouTube.” I’m not sure if you’ve made the mistake of accidentally clicking on the ludicrous amounts of fake trailer AI slop on YouTube, but once you make the mistake once, your algorithm is <em>fucked</em>. It just swarms you with AI content from then on. I wasn’t going to ask this 10-year-old if what they’d watched was AI or not, but there’s little doubt in my mind they watched some AI video slop and took all of it literally.</p><p>I quietly sighed internally, told the kids “oh, that sounds cool,” and walked out.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s going to get so much worse!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@lorenzoherrera?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Lorenzo Herrera</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>That’s the vision Silicon Valley has for us, isn’t it? Promise a massive hardware and resource-intensive infrastructure to power a wholly owned counterfeiting machine, because the sheer absurdity of those demands justifies raising impossible amounts of capital for investors who want big, easy yields on their already ridiculous piles of assets. Use the counterfeiting machine to create content for platforms that have an insatiable appetite for audience size and engagement numbers. Trick elders and children at scale, but if that strategy doesn’t produce sufficient growth, create entire fake “content creators” reaching audiences with increasing numbers of bots performing bleak pantomimes of online life. The end result is theoretically a thriving economy of black box platforms claiming growth that is impossible to verify, blotting out the ability of real creators and audiences to find one another or even be certain that both parties are actual human beings. Is there a real hardware innovation here? Hard to say, it seems like the OpenAI model was partly predicated on being able to buy more expensive hardware than anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there platform innovation? If fraud is innovation (and investors largely decided those two things were synonymous since 2000), then it might qualify insofar as it solves the problem that Facebook’s membership is aging and disengaging by replacing real, live human users with machines posting a slurry of AI content into their feeds. The plans Google and Facebook have for your kids involve them spending their lives glued to their phones watching AI-generated short-form video that makes them feel poor, unattractive, and insufficient, because that is the ideal consumer on those platforms, assuming all their money doesn’t end up in Roblox.&nbsp;</p><!--members-only--><p>Now this week’s big news is that a Chinese-funded and developed competitor to Silicon Valley’s LLM boondoggles called DeepSeek appears to be able to significantly outperform their programs at a fraction of the cost and hardware resources. If all this pans out, it’s possible that a lot of Silicon Valley investors are going to lose massive amounts of money and will not own nearly as much of the infrastructure of this AI dystopia I described above. However, a lot of the companies who want to <em>use </em>AI against their users and workers will not care where the models come from and will happily move on from OpenAI <em>et al. </em>to DeepSeek-powered tech solutions. I hope Silicon Valley investors like Marc Andreesen end up taking a financial beating in this, but I don’t think DeepSeek will halt the encroachment of AI counterfeiting into our lives.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, a better and more efficient system for generating fake answers, fake pictures, fake writing, and fake people will result in <em>more </em>of that stuff, not less.</p><p>Yet here I must make a confession of optimism and admit I don’t think the plan outlined above is going to work. The AI bubble is inflated in large measure thanks to its promise to help prop up platform bubbles across technology. (It also promises to help companies lay off and reduce the value of skilled employees, but that’s a different threat.) I think it might do that in the short term but I think in the long term it’s poison, because once people begin to suspect that <em>nothing </em>on these platforms is trustworthy, not even the people commenting and posting, you’re going to see a lot of users disappear and a complete failure to capture young audiences.</p><p>Bubbles are about the <em>perception </em>of value versus <em>actual </em>value. The history of tech platforms is one where consistent failures to generate actual value is masked by speculative values and acquisition valuations. That works when the whole ballgame is about attracting investors in a world where capital flows freely between markets and you can recoup massive losses with one successful sale (usually to <em>another </em>overcapitalized underperforming firm). But actual human attention is more fickle. The most likely outcome in your daughter’s case is not that she is just cluelessly guzzling fake movie trailers and watching fake influencers. It’s that she stops engaging with that type of content <em>entirely </em>because it all loses value to her. Even a lot of the real stuff, unfortunately, because the rampant counterfeiting is going to devalue it, and eventually she’s going to be looking for places where she doesn’t have to sift through quite so much bullshit to find something authentic. It won’t be a moral stand, it’ll just be a practical one. But all this shit is predicated on connecting people with stuff to sell with people who might potentially want to buy it, and once the sellers realize they’re paying to access phantom audiences, platforms that embraced AI slurry and bullshit growth metrics are going to be in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re already nervous about some of these trends I think, which is why they were so bullish on AI (it also made them look dynamic and innovative), and it’s the nature of a bubble that a lot of interested parties have no interest in popping it. Marketers who have relied on platforms for decades certainly don’t want to tell their clients they’ve wasted 95% of their spend accidentally promoting ads into the feeds of pornbots and disinfo accounts. But the platforms and middle men can only keep this going so far when you’re training these unprecedentedly large audiences that the global commons has turned into something less convincing than the floor show at Chuck E. Cheese.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@hudsoncrafted?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Debby Hudson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I think your instincts are right. Where I see AI slop show up for my oldest is in YouTube Shorts, their equivalent of shortform TikTok-like videos. They are often about showing something heroic, sad, or something in-between. It really is no different <a href="https://www.404media.co/email/1cdf7620-2e2f-4450-9cd9-e041f4f0c27f/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>than the shrimp Jesus stuff that’s all over platforms like Facebook</u></a>, engaged by a collection of bots and old people.</p><p>But young kids and old people have something in common: a lack of perception. Or they don’t care. The result is the same, though, a steady stream of thoughtless engagement with colors.</p><p>With my kid, at least, her reaction to these platforms, despite the slop, is to create. She recently filmed a “YouTube video” with her younger sister, coaching her on what to say, how to walk people through coloring a drawing, and how to “like and subscribe at the end.” The impulse was human. I take solace that beyond the misleading algorithms is a self-driven impulse for art, and you try to unpack that indescribable impulse using the platforms available when you’re alive.</p><p>These companies can try to bury it, but history shows us it will not be denied.</p><p>I mean, sure, she’s emulating a YouTube video, but that’s all you can do at eight years old, you know? You emulate what you know. You emulate, before you can wander into <em>your</em> identity.</p><p>The natural impulse of some parents, I think, is they’ve gotta teach their kids how to suss this bullshit out. I’m not so sure. I think kids are smart, and they will suss out the bullshit on their own. The rise of places like YouTube and Twitch, for all their many faults, is driven by a sense of authenticity—it’s a direct <em>reaction</em> to a long line of media institutions that sanded down personality into bylines. What we’re left with, of course, is often all personality and little substance, but I think the broader point stands. I do not think they will settle for slop. The slop might surround them, might be forced upon them, and they might (to our own frustrations) leverage tools of slop in creating art, but truly, I think they come out the other side mostly okay.</p><p>I am an optimist by nature, though. That’s in my bones. Why else have children in such a despairing age, you know? Because I have some faith they fight to emerge on the other side.</p>

<p>MultiVersus is coming to an end. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-season-5-end-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began to circulate</a> on Thursday that the game could wrap up after Season 5, it’s been announced that MultiVersus is shutting down.</p>



<p>In a post on social media and <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games announced that Season 5 “will serve as the final update for MultiVersus”. The season will run from February 4-May 30. After that day, the game will be taken offline with the game only playable in an offline state.</p>



<p>“At that point, there will be an option to play&nbsp;MultiVersus offline via the local gameplay mode, either solo against A.I. opponents or with up to three friends,” the blog post reads. “To do this, you’ll need to install/download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, any time between February 4 at 9 a.m. PST and May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. </p>



<p>“After logging in, a local save file will be automatically created connected to your PlayStation Network, Microsoft Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store account, allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.​”</p>



<p>Starting today (January 31) real-money transactions will no longer be available in the game. Everything, including the two new characters—Aquaman and Lola Bunny—will be unlockable by playing the game. Lastly, once Season 5 ends on May 30, the game will no longer be able to be downloaded from any marketplace.</p>



<p>As far as the future of developer Player First Games is concerned, that’s currently unknown. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly,” the developers said. “All of us on the Player First Games and&nbsp;Warner Bros&nbsp;Games teams have put our heart and soul into MultiVersus, creating a unique social and cooperative experience from the ground up that brings together a variety of popular characters and worlds.</p>



<p>“We are very proud of the game we have built and are incredibly thankful for the support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey. Your passion and enthusiasm have been unmatched.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespects-former-studio-midnight-society-closes-down.1096905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dr. Disrespect's former studio Midnight Society has announced that it's closing down, which presumably also means that work on first-person extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>will also come to an end.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on X, Midnight Society says it's "closing its doors after three incredible years", which also means that its "amazing team of over 55 developers" are now looking for work. The studio says it's "actively seeking other game studios" to provide those employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Although Midnight Society doesn't explicitly say that&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, it's unlikely that work on the game will continue; that would require another studio to pick up the slack or for Midnight Society members to form a new outfit, and there's no indication that will happen, so it looks like the game is, er, dead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-society-shutting-down-deadrop.jpg?itok=gtu-zY_A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-society-shutting-down-deadrop.jpg?itok=esGyfraP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>studio Midnight Society, which was founded in part by Dr. Disrespect, is closing down.</figcaption></figure><p>Midnight Society was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrespect-game-studio-midnight-society-announced" rel="nofollow">founded back in 2021</a>, with controversial YouTuber Dr. Disrespect serving as one of the founders of the studio, as well as its public face.</p>

<p>The studio's first project,&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, was revealed under the codename&nbsp;<em>Project Moon</em>, and the studio said back in 2022 that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrepects-game-studio-wants-player-feedback-every-6-weeks" rel="nofollow">collect user feedback on a regular basis</a>, using it to shape the direction of the game.</p>

<p>In June, however, Dr. Disrespect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor" rel="nofollow">was fired</a> from Midnight Society following allegations of sexual misconduct, which were apparently part of the reason for the content creator's lifetime Twitch ban in 2020.</p>

<p>His YouTube channel was also demonetized, although YouTube recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reversed that decision</a>, allowing Dr. Disrespect (real name Guy Beahm) to continue to make money through his channel.</p>




<p>Following Beahm's ousting from Midnight Society, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;back in September, with one of&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>'s Founders (essentially a major contributor to the studio rather than an actual founder) claiming that around 50% of the studio's workforce was let go. It looks like now we know why.</p>

It remains to be seen what the critical and commercial reception to the game will be, but Clair Obscur has garnered attention for its vibrant visuals from the preview trailers that have been released so far, with the latest one being during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/" data-ref-id="2900-6159">January 2025

The XM4 assault rifle has been a top choice since Black Ops 6's integration into Warzone, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-patch-notes-detail-major-camo-and-weapon-changes/2900-6170/#12">Season 2's initial nerf</a> to the gun's damage range wasn't enough to get players to switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2's Cypher 091 assault rifle is a strong contender for battle royale, but it's not quite an easy-to-use laser beam like the XM4. Another XM4 nerf could potentially address the gun's handling and recoil, making the Cypher 091 a more competitive option for long-range fights in battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">The PPSh-41 has been a popular weapon choice in past Call of Duty titles, but the submachine gun is currently underperforming since arriving with the Season 2 update. As of right now, the C9 submachine gun is the most popular option for close-range combat, so it's possible the season's new submachine gun could receive buffs to make it more viable for battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the exact changes until the developer releases the patch notes. To see what recently changed, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-patch-notes-detail-major-camo-and-weapon-changes/2900-6170/" data-ref-id="2900-6170">Season 2 patch notes for Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, leakers suggest a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-tmnt-crossover-could-be-coming/1100-6529089/">TMNT crossover could arrive later in the season</a>. Season 2 currently features a battle pass of ninja-like operators, and the midseason update is set to introduce unannounced melee weapons and a skatepark map.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, so get ready to start slaying some zeds come springtime.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the third installment in the studio's&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series will launch on March 25th across PC and current-gen consoles, and pre-orders are open now if you already know you're going to be playing this one on day one.</p>

<p>Several versions of the game will be available at launch, and pre-ordering any of them will net you a bonus that includes a weapon skin, a trinket, and a player card. Of course, you'll get a bunch of extra goodies if you order any of the non-standard editions as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=aNSyQFki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=tlyplPpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches in March.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pick&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>up at retail, you'll be able to get the Standard Edition in North America or the Day One Edition outside of that territory. The latter comes with the Flatline Tactical Bundle and a special skin pack, while the former either comes with the skin pack or the bundle (and costs a little less into the bargain).</p>

<p>As for digital editions, you will,óf course, be able to buy the game on its own, but you'll also be able to pick up the Deluxe and Elite Nightfall Editions, which pack in a bunch of extras and some Creds to go along with them.</p>

<p>If you want to check out <i>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</i>before it's released, you can still <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gain access</a> to the game's closed beta, which runs from February 20th to 24th. You can check out the trailer below to learn more about that.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer FPS that serves as the third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>franchise. It takes place 70 years after the events of the second game and once again sees you teaming up with your buddies to fight off waves of hostile "zeds" (read: zombies, but with qualifications).</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 25th.</p>

Box office hit Wicked features Epic Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> during the movie's most iconic musical number.
</p>
<p>
The film's finale, built around breakout song Defying Gravity, sees Elphaba burst out of a window and try to take flight upon her broom.
</p>
<p>
But what you probably didn't realise is that, during this sequence, the sound effects you hear of Elphaba falling are taken from Fortnite. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Wicked uses Fortnite's sound effects that play at the beginning of every battle royale match as you leap from the Battle Bus and glide through the air down to the ground.
</p>
<p>
The detail can be seen in a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBAv0Ld38Lk">The Rough Cut</a>, where Wicked's editor Myron Kerstein discusses the complex sequence and all the visual, musical and sound effect cues that went in to putting it all together. 
</p>
<p>
Kerstein doesn't specifically call out the use of the Fortnite sound effect, but it can clearly be seen within the film's audio mix, labelled "All Skydiving Fly Sounds (Fortnite) - Sound effects for editing", around the 7:20 mark in the video below.

<p>
As for Kerstein's video, it's an interesting watch if you've seen the film or have a passing interest in how scenes like this are put together - not least because Kerstein appears to find it amusing how many times Defying Gravity is paused then restarted throughout the film's final scene (too many).

<p>
Wicked star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-fortnites-ariana-grande-concert-to-rewatch">Ariana Grande is already in Fortnite</a>, of course. So, Epic Games, when can I nab an Elphaba skin?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/what-we-played-eternal-strands-cuisineer-retroid-pocket-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>And with that, January is done. Often the longest month known to man, it’s actually flown by here, helped in no small part by having lots of games to play. I’m making a started on Avowed for our review in mid-February, and I’ve loved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a> this week, which is well worth checking out if you have Game Pass. Other than that, I enjoyed some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/27/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-review/">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a> and I’ve been tinkering with my Retroid Pocket 5 (not a euphemism) and drowning in a sea of data transfers and microSD cards that have decided they’re unhappy.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Jim</strong> has been juggling a few different games with Alan Wake II at the top of his playlist. He told us, “I’m glad Remedy got another shot at making one of these – the combat gameplay isn’t terribly inventive though I’m enjoying the wacky story and setting. I’ve also revisited Dynasty Warriors: Origins which continues to be great fun. I’d be surprised if we don’t see some kind of DLC in the near future, perhaps unlocking new weapon types.” He continued, “Finally, I played some SMITE 2 which is now in open beta. It’s still a great concept, pitting deities and mythological heroes against each other, and it plays beautifully on PS5. I’m just not sure I’m ready to commit to another MOBA after all these years.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is not here, opting instead to go on his honeymoon to Japan! So far he’s done a tour of Tokyo and set foot on Mount Fuji, and we’re not jealous in any way. Nope, not one bit. *sob*</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> <em>is</em> here, and he’s taken a break from overdosing on Unicorn Overlord to review the side-scrolling beat ’em up Big Helmet Heroes. He dropped an immense bombshell relating to this, saying, “Whilst the game is embargoed until next week, I can exclusively reveal that the heroes do indeed have very big helmets.” After that shock, he managed to play at least one other thing, saying, “I’ve also been playing the recently released remake of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black for review. It’s still great and I’m now even more excited for Ninja Gaiden 4 than should be allowed. The government should pass some legislation to prevent my excitement levels from increasing any more, lest I explode.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/cuisineer-review/">Cuisineer</a> for review. He’s not been well though, saying, “I’ve played nothing else because I’ve been devastatingly ill for four days. Again.” Get well soon mate!</p>

<p>He might also have recovered from multiple illnesses in reality, but <strong>Steve</strong> has been struggling with Stone of Madness, the new game from the Blasphemous devs. He says, “I love the setting and themes but am just awful at stealth and that’s the primary mechanic – should have read up on it in advance!” He continued,&nbsp; “I also ploughed through Gears of War 3 in my rapid run through the series. It’s really impressive how much the games improve over each iteration and I’m excited to see how the next-gen Gears of War 4 shapes up, but I’m going through Baird’s story in Judgement first. I am wondering what will provide the emotional centre given some of the events of 3 which does feel like an appropriate end to the trilogy in lots of ways.”</p>
<p>Finally, after my positive review he’s also installed Eternal Strands and played the opening sections, saying, “It feels pretty cool and I’m looking forward to see how it opens up.”</p>
<p>Finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been playing a shooty zombie game (which required him to install Windows 11, really ramping up the horror factor), shot his way through a bunch of Nazis in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/27/sniper-elite-resistance-review/">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>, and after all that shooting has now decided to start a new life as a tram driver.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fable-could-be-a-simultaneous-xbox-ps5-switch-2-release-starfield-is-close-to-its-playstation-5-release-%E2%80%93-rumor.1096842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fable, the next entry in the series in development by Playground Games, may be a multiplatform release right from launch, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350777664/starfield-fable-y-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-llegaran-a-playstation-5-y-switch-2-segun-nuestras-fuentes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vandal</a>, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-big-steam-deck-new-joy-cons/">proved</a> to be somewhat reliable, shared in a new report today that work on the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 versions of Fable has already begun, and the game could release on the two systems at the same time as it lands on PC and Xbox Series X and S.</p>
<p>In addition to revealing that Fable is already in the works for other systems, the new report also revealed that Killer Instinct and Starfield are among the closest former Xbox exclusives to release on other platforms. The PlayStation 5 version of Bethesda's latest RPG has been in the works since its launch in late 2023.</p>
<p>While the news of Fable being a multiplatform release right from launch must be taken with a grain of salt, there's a good chance of it happening, considering Microsoft's new strategy, and some recent statements from Phil Spencer, who said outright that <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/">keeping their games off other platforms is not the path for the publisher</a>. In addition, Microsoft's new multiplatform strategy has started to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-top-publisher-december-2024/">bear fruit</a>, so it really wouldn't be surprising for the publisher to double down on it, and release some of its most anticipated games on other platforms right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Fable is currently scheduled for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/">2025 release</a>, so it shouldn't take much longer to learn more about it, including its rumored multiplatform launch. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/n64-classic-ridge-racer-64-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online.1096839/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another N64 classic for Nintendo Switch Online, and this one's perfect if you're a fan of retro racing games.</p>

<p>Today's new Switch Online addition is&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64</em>, and just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie" rel="nofollow">other</a> N64 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the service, you're going to need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the basic Nintendo Switch Online subscription will get you access to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-january-2025" rel="nofollow">SNES</a> and NES games, as well as Game Boy classics, but you'll need to fork out a little extra if you want N64, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a>, and Game Boy Advance games (as well as DLC for a couple of Switch games).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-ridge-racer-64-car.jpg?itok=ly6uTtsP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-ridge-racer-64-car.jpg?itok=ZEyywH0G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>is yours to check out on Switch Online, assuming you have an Expansion Pack.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>itself, it was first released in 2000, and it's the series' first foray outside of PlayStation (not counting arcade versions, of course). Unusually, it's also one of the only times Nintendo itself has worked on an IP that isn't its own.</p>

<p>The game received a DS port in 2004, but obviously, it's the N64 version you'll be getting here, complete with its full track complement and range of unlockable extra cars.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy local multiplayer with up to three friends, as well as several different gameplay modes including Grand Prix, Quick Play, and special modes like Time Attack and Car Attack.</p>

<p>If you want to know what you're getting into when you play&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64</em>, you can check out Nintendo's new trailer for the game on Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Nintendo is currently gearing up for the impending launch of the Switch 2, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">announced the console</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>We don't know when it's releasing yet, but we do know that the Switch Online service will continue to be available on Switch 2, so it's likely that the current console's retro game lineup will also be accessible on the new machine.</p>

<p><em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>is available right now for Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack holders.</p>

			<p>Today, Tripwire Interactive announced the release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killing Floor 3</a>. The third chapter in the cooperative first-person shooter zombie game will be available on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/killing-floor-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X starting March 25. Pre-orders are now open across all platforms through retail and digital stores.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail, global publisher PLAION will offer the following options:</p>

<p>Like with any game that opens up pre-orders, Killing Floor 3 also shared the PC system requirements via the store pages. Long story short, it won't be a very taxing game to run on your rig.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will take place roughly 70 years after the previous installment, when megacorporation Horzine has created the ultimate army: a docile horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. The only thing standing between them and mankind is the rogue group known as Nightfall. The game puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, who'll then team up with up to five teammates. Smarter AI, dynamic environments, new and fully customizable weapons, and even more realistic dismemberment are the signature features promised by Tripwire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If having to wait two months sounds too long, you could try <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up</a> for the Closed Beta that will take place between February 20 and 24. As a side note, the game's release window s<a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hared in May 2024</a> by Embracer Group has been respected. We'll see if that's the case for two other games published by Embracer, Titan Quest II and Gothic Remake, both of which were also slated to launch by March.</p>

<p>Since its release last week, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has seen a lot of attention from the modding community, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few mods</a> have already been released to address some of the game's most glaring issues and allow players to do something that is not possible in the vanilla game, such as adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-addresses-pop-in-playable-sephiroth-zack/">Sephiroth and Zack to the party</a>. The two characters work reasonably well in combat, but what is possible to do with them is extremely limited at the moment, as no one has currently figured out how to change their equipment and Materia.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

However, the Nixxes-developed port has debuted to a 'mixed' Steam user review rating, with many players complaining about technical issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, 55% of Spider-Man 2's Steam reviews are positive. “Despite having a high-end GPU and running the latest Nvidia drivers (5.66.36), the game frequently crashes,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said one RTX 4090 user</u></a>.

In the artwork, below, a group of Weavile are hiding in the treetops with claws at the ready, preparing to prey on an innocent Swinub.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No Swinub," look up!

"Always got to be one card per set that shows Pokémon in the process of straight up killing each other," one user replied. "Leave the lil guy alone," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The ecology of Pokémon is always so crazy to imagine," another fan added. "Like these are still animals, some smarter than others. Just they have the ability to fire laser beams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are choosing to believe the full art card for Mamoswine, the final evolution of Swinub, depicts a happy ending though, as it shows the mammoth pocket monster looking up while protecting a handful of Swinub.time</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hey, Mamoswine protected his baby. Don't worry. He most definitely saw those Weaviles," said one desperate fan. "The Mamoswine alt card already looks above. He saw them.

It includes a total of 207 cards and is therefore significantly smaller than Genetic Apex's 286. That being said, 52 of these are the alternate art, Star and Crown rarity cards, and as Genetic Apex had 60 of these, there is a higher percentage of rare pieces to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. still hasn't commented on<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it"> the controversial trading update which arrived the day before</a>, with its social media accounts and the game itself only really focusing on Space-Time Smackdown. It also failed to respond to IGN's request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A "Trade Feature Celebration Gift" did arrive with 500 Trade Tokens and 120 Trade Hourglasses (the former of which is enough to trade a single ex Pokémon), but the developer has otherwise remained quiet on fan complaints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p>The issues persist even for those with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/">higher-end PCs running the latest drivers</a>.</p>
<p>"Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilisation patches out because holy hell," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/">said</a> one reviewer who felt obliged to share their experience after just half an hour with the game.</p>

<p>Even players who leave a positive thumbs-up are taking the time to caution others.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the launch is pretty bad," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ravyyyyyyy/recommended/2651280/">added</a> another player. "Crashes every 20 minutes or so if you have turned ON the Frame Generation (which, guess what, is turned ON by default). A bit of stuttering here and there. The hair on the models looks awful. OH! And the biggest issue I had, was that I tried to delete my saves so I can start a New Game (you can't do that until you get rid of the old one), and I couldn't do that, seems it wasn't working. I had to disable the Steam Cloud, manually delete the save, and only then it worked. BIG OOF.</p>
<p>"Other than that, haven't had any other problems.</p>
<p>"I am only recommending it because I believe they will solve these issues, as they have pushed a minor patch after the launch, and because I am a Spider-Man fan."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony confirmed it was dropping its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC</a>, but introduced in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the worst-kept secrets is out in the open—Forza Horizon 5 is coming to the PS5. We know its release period, and the developer has already discussed the game’s release time details and brand-new content on the way.</p>



<p>The Xbox and PlayStation partnership continues to blow minds in 2025. The two companies have waged war for two decades across numerous generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. But the tides have turned in the last few years. We’re seeing more Xbox exclusives and Microsoft-owned titles come to the PS5.</p>



<p>Halo is rumored to be coming to PlayStation, as are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Hellblade</a>. One title we can tick off though is Forza Horizon 5. The Horizon series (and Forza Motorsport) have battled against PlayStation’s Gran Turismo for years, but now the racer has turned a corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-5-coming-to-ps5">Is Forza Horizon 5 Coming to PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beauties. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 and it marks the first time a Forza title has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</strong></p>



<p>We thought the official announcement was coming in 2024, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 PS5 Release was apparently delayed</a>. The news finally arrived on January 30 to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 is on its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-release-period">Forza Horizon 5 Release Period</h2>



<p><strong>Spring 2025 is the release period for Forza Horizon on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The season of Spring is considered <strong>March, April, and May</strong>, meaning Forza Horizon 5 isn’t far away. I can hear the tires screeching in the distance it’s that close. As the weeks fly by faster than a Lamborghini, we’re sure to get a more accurate release date for you to write down in your diary.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn the latest on Forza Horizon 5’s release date. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-forza-horizon-5-s-release-times">Do we Know Forza Horizon 5’s Release Times?</h2>



<p>Official release times haven’t been released yet, but developer Playground Games has said to “<strong>Wishlist Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation Store&nbsp;today to stay informed about updates and release times.</strong>“</p>



<p>This is significant because it makes me believe we may be getting different release times everywhere. Again, stay tuned for updates on Forza Horizon 5’s release time for PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-horizon-realms-content">Forza Horizon 5 Horizon Realms Content</h2>



<p><strong>Horizon Realms is a completely new piece of content for Forza Horizon 5, and it’s “a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds.”</strong></p>



<p>That’s not all though as the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer is also promising</a> “<strong>other surprises</strong>” too. The content is releasing alongside all “the same content as the Xbox and PC releases of the game.” PlayStation 5 players have a lot of gameplay to look forward to and a lot of rubber to burn!</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve primarily been a PlayStation and occasional Nintendo fan in my life, making Forza Horizon 5 my first foray into Forza. How about you? Is this going to be a debut drive? Or have you already racked up a ton of mileage?</p>



<p>We have even more rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games coming to PlayStation</a>, and we already know other Xbox and Bethesda games are PS5-bound: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod.1096788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly two years since PureDark started <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-tes-v-skyrim-is-out-now-alpha-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing</a> his DLSS Frame Generation mods with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. While the regular DLSS mod is available for free, the Frame Generation one was locked to his Patreon subscribers.</p>
<p>At last, the Community Shaders team has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a free version of DLSS FG for Skyrim. This is based on the NVIDIA Streamline plugin; however, due to a long-standing DX11 bug that exists for DLSS FG and Reflex, NVIDIA's technology isn't actually lowering the latency. According to the CS team, this isn't a big issue if your frame rate is already running over 60 frames per second, though, of course, they still hope NVIDIA will eventually fix that bug.</p>
<p>There are a few more caveats. The mod does not support Skyrim VR (you've got space warp there, which they say is even better), is not compatible with the SSE ReShade Helper mod, and also isn't fully compatible with ReShade itself. From the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>Effects will run twice as slow, and depth effects are not supported. Basic effects are fine.</em></p>
<p>To ensure that everything is working as intended, you'll need to set the frame rate limit via SSE Display Tweaks (which is also a requirement) to half your refresh rate (rounded down).</p>
<p>The Community Shaders team acknowledged the sudden release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-adds-smooth-motion-a-driver-based-frame-generation-ai-model-for-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Smooth Motion</a> as a potential better way to add frame generation for the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards; however, this mod remains useful for GeForce RTX 40 Series owners.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Community Shaders suite was recently updated with some major graphics enhancements for Skyrim, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Physically Based Rendering (PBR)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic cloud shadows and skylighting</a>, just to name a few. There's more on the way, too, including a fix to unlock the amount of draw calls so that more of these graphics features can be enabled at once without crashes.</p>

The Tustin, California Micro Center store seems to have received the most stock, but other stores reportedly had 10 or less RTX 5090 cards. While Nvidia’s RTX 5080 was a little easier to purchase on launch day, cards rapidly went out of stock at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1ie4y57/3_days_and_2_nights_later/">Reddit poster</a> claims to have secured an RTX 5090 after three days waiting in line, and others have posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1idr7en/thank_you_miami_microcenter_for_the_surprise_fes/">purchase vouchers</a> that were handed out to people in line at a Miami Micro Center. The overwhelming amount of posts are from people complaining about the launch and lack of stock, though.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMd2WHKnceI&amp;t=731s">Gamers Nexus claims</a> that one of the biggest system integrators in the US only received a single RTX 5090 on launch day, before a smaller shipment arrived later in the day. Another big system builder reportedly received no units and third one received 20 RTX 5090s that it sold in pre-built machines in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Many retailers are now simply listing preorders for RTX 5090 cards, with Scan in the UK <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/shop/computer-hardware/gpu-nvidia-gaming/geforce-rtx-5090-graphics-cards">warning</a> that some cards aren’t due in stock until the end of May — four months after the launch date. Naturally, such low stock levels in the face of high demand means there are scalpers selling RTX 5090 cards <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F135526084360%3F_skw%3DRTX%2B5090%26itmmeta%3D01JJXZBP50G6YQ74BV2GKTJ4M7%26hash%3Ditem1f8dfbef08%3Ag%3A~VUAAOSwPndnm-M0" rel="sponsored">on eBay</a> for $5,000 or more. YouTuber JayzTwoCents <a href="https://x.com/JayzTwoCents/status/1885046213889663457">even found</a> an RTX 5090 on sale for $5,800 on Facebook, after he signed the card at the Tustin Micro Center store earlier in the day.</p><p>We reached out to Nvidia to comment on the RTX 5090 launch issues, but the company refused to comment beyond its previous warning about stock shortages.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
