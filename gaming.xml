            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Krafton, the parent company of Subnautica and Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, announced that the three studio founders, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were no longer with the studio</a>, and that they would be replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head, Steve Papoutsis. </p>



<p>What followed were <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">reassurances</a> from the remaining Unknown Worlds team that Subnautica 2's development was still in good hands as players suddenly had concerns now that three of the studio's core members were gone, and that the team was "<em>extremely proud</em>" of what they were building with Subnautica 2. Cleveland also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">published a lengthy farewell statement</a> to the game's community, claiming that Subnautica 2 was ready to release in early access before the end of 2025, and that his and his two other co-founders' departures were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</p>



<p>Then, a little less than a week later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a> published a report that claimed that Subnautica 2 was delayed into 2026, just as Unknown Worlds was nearing revenue targets that would have netted the studio a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus,</a> per the agreement they signed when Krafton acquired Unknown Worlds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">2021</a>. With Subnautica 2 pushed into 2026, members of the team at Unknown Worlds felt that the revenue goals it was meant to hit between 2021 and 2025 were now "<em>unattainable</em>," and it seemed that Krafton's decision to delay the early access launch might have stemmed from the company wanting to avoid paying the large bonus.</p>

<iframe title="Subnautica 2 - &quot;Take a Deep Breath&quot; (Gameplay Reveal Teaser)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hours after Bloomberg's initial report, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">Krafton denied that the decision to delay the game came from any financial considerations or contract obligations</a>, and Unknown Worlds confirmed that Subnautica 2 was delayed into 2026. The reason given for the delay pointed to feedback from an internal playtest, though according to Bloomberg's report, at an internal meeting, Papoutsis told the development team that Krafton's leaders believed Subnautica 2 needed more content before it could launch in early access.</p>



<p>Now, the story has become even more muddled, as <a href="https://krafton.com/en/">Krafton published a lengthy statement of its own</a>, in which it points the finger directly at Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, claiming that the three co-founders "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio and their responsibilities, and that the blame falls to them for Subnautica 2 still not being out in early access. It calls their removal "<em>inevitable</em>" and "<em>necessary</em>" based on their actions and alleged refusal to fulfill their roles at the studio.</p>



<p>Krafton also claims that 90% of the $250 million bonus was going straight to the three co-founders, "<em>with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership</em> <em>and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2,"</em> the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an early access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game director and technical director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current early access version also falls short in terms of content volume. We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</em>"</p>



<p>Krafton goes on to say that it has "<em>committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development</em>,<em>"</em> and that it has reaffirmed "<em>our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised</em>."</p>



<p>Along with his initial report on Bloomberg, author Jason Schreier added that per documentation he received regarding the $250 million bonus, 10% of it was to be allocated between 40 members of the Unknown Worlds development team, all to receive varying amounts. He also said that the co-founders had intended to give some of their bonuses to other employees.</p>







<p>This has easily grown to become one of the year's more unbelievable stories so far, and it wouldn't be a surprise at this point if it evolved into a legal battle. We'll update this story as it develops. </p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Hearts originally launched in February 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, the game was published by EA under its EA Originals label, though this Switch 2 version is published by Koei Tecmo (so an EA account won't be needed for multiplayer). The developer behind Wild Hearts S is Omega Force, best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While Wild Hearts S is clearly inspired by the Monster Hunter series, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-hearts-6-ways-its-different-from-monster-hunter/1100-6511581/">plenty of ways the game is different</a>. For instance, the game utilizes automatons called Karakuri that let players build blocks to climb as well as create zip lines to quickly get across environments.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/" data-ref-id="1900-6418030">Wild Hearts review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>' seventh birthday celebrations back in March, developer Rare has cast its spyglass toward new horizons, outlining its vision for the multiplayer pirate adventure's future in its first-ever Community Direct livestream. And those plans include the introduction of multi-ship private servers and paid custom servers "early" next year.
</p>
<p>
Today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">stream</a> wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of affairs, despite its hour-long runtime, but it did see Rare admitting to having dropped the ball in terms of game health and narrative momentum in recent years. Both are things it's talked about before, but it's now detailed some of the ways it hopes to keep players onboard as Sea of Thieves sails into year eight and beyond.
</p>
<p>
To that end, the studio talked at length about "finding balance" between introducing new features, reinvigorating and expanding some of Sea of Thieves' neglected legacy systems - including the likes of captaincy, hourglass battles, and guilds - tackling long-standing bugs and issues, and implementing some of the community's most-requested features.

<p>
As to what that'll look like in practical terms, from Sea of Thieves' upcoming Season 17 onward, seasons will "focus more consistently on reaching a broader set of player motivations". That means a mix of new stuff, revisiting previous content to "tease out more value", plus a renewed sense of narrative and world-building to ensure seasons are "always moving the world forward". The studio did, however, stress story won't be "front and centre", implying the likes of Tall Tales and long-abandoned Adventures are now well and truly a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Season 17, each three-month-long season will follow a fixed pattern: month one will focus on "reinvigorating the sandbox" and "stirring the pot around a theme and a set of motivations" to keep things fresh; month two will bring an "expanded approach to live events", while month three will introduce some kind of community call to action. Additionally, recurring seasonal events will now be run on a more predictable schedule: Community Weekends, for instance, will take place during the first month of a season, and Gold and Glory in the third.
</p>
<p>
Using the upcoming Season 17: Smugglers' Tide as an example, Rare's revised plan means month one will bring the new Smugglers faction, new hideouts around the world, new smuggling runs that reward players for ferrying dangerous cargo, and a refresh for the likes of shipwrecks and skeleton ships, which will both harbour valuable smuggler cargo. 
</p>

<p>
Month two introduces a new heist-inspired live event, bringing the community together to battle over a sea fort location (Rare notes these live events won't be one-and-done, but will instead enter some sort of rotation), and month three gives Skeleton Forts a Reaper-themed makeover. So alongside the likes of a new loot pool, players can anticipate being invaded by the Dark Brethren and their ghost ships mid-battle, switching crews' role from invaders to defenders. All that and a narrative thread to bring the whole season together.
</p>
<p>
And that'll be the seasonal template players can expect from here on out. Season 18, for instance, is aiming to revitalise Sea of Thieves' long-neglected Devil's Roar area, introducing a banished faction of Dark Ancients, hidden shrines, a new ancient threat, plus reinvigorated Emissary gameplay. Beyond that, things are a lot vaguer, with Rare teasing a "multi-year" vision it'll talk about in the next Community Direct, in six months' time.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to Rare's final reveal: confirmation that custom servers - AKA Custom Seas - are coming in "early 2026". These are set to feature a host of options and toggles, enabling players to turn off the likes of the kraken or storms, spawn in chests, break current crew limits, and more. They'll also include access to the tools Rare uses to make its trailers, including a cinematic camera. The catch is all this is being labelled as a "premium" feature, and will require a regular subscription to access - Rare's justification being that custom servers are expensive to develop, maintain, and continue evolving.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Sea of Thieves' Safer Seas mode - which essentially gives a single ship and its crew access to a private server version of the game, albeit one with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-is-finally-letting-private-server-players-earn-full-rewards-starting-in-december">some restrictions</a> - will be expanded to allow fleets of friends to sail together. This announcement came amid Rare's chatter of custom servers, and it's not entirely clear if this is a free addition or if it'll require the custom server subscription. I've asked Microsoft for clarification.
</p>
<p>
Sea of Thieves' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">inaugural Community Direct</a> is a fairly meandering thing, but probably still worth a watch for some insight into Rare's thinking (there's also talk of an overhaul for its long-running Insiders programme, which includes the ditching of its NDAs and the ushering in of a new spoiler-filled future), just don't expect much in the way of specific reveals.
</p>
<p>
Today's Sea of Thieves Community Direct does, of course, follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping layoffs and project cancellations across Microsoft and its Xbox division</a> last week. One <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">notable casualty was Rare's fantasy action-adventure Everwild</a>, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">all the way back in 2019</a>. In the wake of its cancellation, Rare veteran Gregg Mayles - who directed the likes of Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie before helming Everwild - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">confirmed to be departing the studio</a> after 35 years.

          <p>In 2019, Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2019/5/16/18627669/nintendo-switch-online-game-vouchers-deal">announced</a> a new benefit for subscribers to its Switch Online service: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">a pair of game vouchers</a>, available for $100, that could be redeemed for any two Switch games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=pd&amp;p=0">Nintendo's eligibility list</a>. If you already knew you were going to be buying first-party games, the voucher could save you $20, or even $30, if you used it on the normally $70 <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo announced today that it will soon end the program, rather than carrying it forward into the Switch 2 era. Switch Online subscribers can still buy a pair of vouchers until the end of January 2026, and those vouchers will be redeemable for up to a year after purchase, but you can't buy new vouchers after that.</p>
<p>The vouchers were already notably&nbsp;<em>not</em> usable to buy Switch 2-exclusive games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. However, for hybrid Switch games with a separate Switch 2 Edition, you could still use them to buy a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and then upgrade it to the Switch 2 edition separately.&nbsp;Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">said on its FAQ page</a> that new titles would be added to the eligibility list between now and January 2026, raising the possibility that upcoming high-profile hybrid games like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> or&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>could make the list.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Each game (aside from Caribbean Crashers) comes from the same publisher, Slitherine, which is currently hosting a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/Slitherine25thAnniversaryPublisherSale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">25th anniversary sale on Steam</a> and is known for publishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">strategy games</a>. The three free Slitherine games all sport "Very Positive" user reviews, with Battlestar Galactica Deadlock looking to be the most popular and well-received of the bunch.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Black Lab Games, players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlestar-galactica-deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-464881">Battlestar Galactica Deadlock</a> take control of the Colonial Fleet during the First Cylon War and strategize their way to victory in turn-based, 3D space battles.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> housing system will see players level-up their homes by completing neighborhood-wide events called Endeavors, ones that will visually change neighborhoods and offer special decorations for a limited-time.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed those new details about the MMORPG's highly anticipated housing system and more in a recent <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24221516" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. While Blizzard already announced players would be buying homes as part of either public or private neighborhoods, now we know more about how exactly it will all work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One key part of WoW's neighborhoods will be Endeavors. These neighborhood-wide events occur about once a month and visually transform the neighborhood to represent different cultures or factions found in Azeroth. Each Endeavor will introduce tasks that can be completed by those living in the neighborhood, ranging from competing quests to crafting certain items or finishing dungeons. Once enough tasks are completed collectively, the whole neighborhood is rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing an Endeavor's tasks come with two main rewards: a special currency used to purchase themed decorations from visiting Endeavor NPCs and Neighborhood Favor. It's the latter reward that looks to serve as housing XP of sorts, leveling up what looks to be a housing version of the game's Renown track system. Each new housing level grants new decoration items and sometimes will even increase housing limitations, like how many decorations a player can have in their house.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of Endeavors is to give neighborhoods common goals to strive for, add choices for how a neighborhood looks, and also introduce asymmetry between different neighborhoods, as not all neighborhoods will be working on the same Endeavor. While players in public neighborhoods will have their Endeavors essentially chosen for them, those in private neighborhoods will be able to choose from a selection of possible Endeavors. This allows for players to visit different neighborhoods and purchase Endeavor decoration rewards that might not be available in their own neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's housing level system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Along with announcing Endeavors, Blizzard additionally answered some common questions it has heard from players, like how to move homes if a player doesn't like living in a place or next to a particular person, or how much control players will have over who can visit their home.</p><p dir="ltr">If a player doesn't like where they are living, they can just pick up their house and move. Blizzard said it's made changing home locations "frictionless and straightforward." Giving up a home will save its state, after which players can then "unpack" that home at a new location without having to redecorate or rebuild the home's interior. Homes in WoW are essentially magic boxes that can be as big or small as a player wants, so not having to redo previous work sounds like a smart move.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard emphasized that neighborhoods are quite large in size, with 50 housing plots spread across different biomes within the zone. Some homes will be more isolated for those who want to live the hermit lifestyle without neighbors, while others will be part of small or large cul-de-sacs that encourage more social interaction.</p><p dir="ltr">As for home permissions, Blizzard is giving players ultimate control over who can visit, with options for allowing (or denying) friends, guildmates, neighbors, or the general public. There will also be an option for allowing people to visit the outside plot of a home, but not come inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Details about Endeavors and neighborhoods are just the latest information Blizzard has shared about player housing, having previously shared its insights on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's houses will be available for everyone who wants one</a>, how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/" data-ref-id="1100-6531163">housing system will reward past achievements</a>, and all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">nitty-gritty decoration options</a> players will have.</p><p dir="ltr">In May, GameSpot was among the first to go <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on with WoW's housing decoration tools</a>, and we came away impressed at the possibilities it offered, even in an early, unfinished state.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's housing system was announced to be coming as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMO's next expansion, Midnight</a>, but is now expected to arrive ahead of it, perhaps as part of the expansion's pre-patch update.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-my-pants-are-from-outlier-because-they-appear-to-live-forever.1240782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a pair of pants that are almost 11 years old. They’re light olive, made from a very lightweight form of nylon and at this point acceptably shabby. I have kept them this long for two reasons: I spent a decent amount of money on them, and they’re so well made that I couldn’t kill them unless I actively tried. This is the reason why Outlier is the only company that I trust for men’s pants.</p><p>If you have never met me, you should know that I’m a large guy, hovering between 6’1” and 6’2” depending on how bad my posture is on any given day. Prior to getting into Outlier, my plan in my shithead 20s era was to buy whatever pair of Uniqlo jeans fit me, get them <a href="https://faq-us.uniqlo.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Alterations-for-In-Store-Purchases/?l=en_US&amp;fs=RelatedArticle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hemmed for free at the store</a> and then drive them into the dirt until the crotch exploded from the force of my quadriceps.&nbsp;</p><p>A few things changed. The first is that I developed a fashion sense. It helped that there were a lot of very good sample sales in New York City, providing a steady drip of fashion pieces for my broke ass. The other was that I got tired of fast fashion failing me constantly. New York City is notoriously hard on clothes; it’s nasty here, and I wanted pants that would not get immediately ruined after a year of being subjected to the weather and grime.</p><figure><figcaption>I was able to track down the exact moment I started wearing these pants.</figcaption></figure><p>I cannot remember how Outlier came on my radar, but at the time they were a company with a goal of making clothes durable enough to withstand the abuse of a cycling commute, similar to Levi’s Commuter line, but that fashioned in a manner presentable enough for an office job. The cycling angle has faded over time (in part because it has become easier to cycle in the city), but the commitment to performance fabrics and construction has not. Outlier still prides themselves on using good materials to an obsessive degree, constantly trying to find some technical fabric from Japan or one that is borderline impossible to source on a consumer level. The majority of their clothing has traditionally lacked a logo, theirs being a simple silhouette of a black swan, although they’ve gotten slightly bolder on including (easy to remove) tags on newer items. Outlier’s basics are what William Gibson would describe as “CPUs” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayce_Pollard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cayce Pollard Units</a> in the book <em>Pattern Recognition</em>: reliable standards that lack any external branding worn by the logo-allergic protagonist Cayce Pollard.</p><figure><figcaption>They only recently started adding logos to their stuff, and they are all fairly easy to remove.</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever treated yourself to something nice and realized you’re never going to be able to buy the worse alternative ever again? That’s what happened when I bought my pair of lightweight <a href="https://archive-m2.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/futureworks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futureworks</a>. Not only were they comfortable, water resistant and well made, they also fit my body perfectly. But probably the most important part was how they were stitched together. Many mens pants are sewn in such a way as to tear directly down the middle, while the Futureworks had a gusseted crotch - a piece of fabric sewn to the natural stress point of the crotch that removes that tension from the equation. That, combined with the fact that they were made out of fairly strong, slightly stretchy nylon, has made them a durable staple.</p><figure><figcaption>Nice basics from left to right: SDs, New Way Seven Fives, Futuredarts. CreditOutlier</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually the Futureworks would be supplanted by the <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futuredarts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futuredarts</a>, which would further refine the pants by adding <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futuredarts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darting to them</a>. Outlier does a fairly good job at keeping a comprehensive archive of their old lines of clothing online, so you can easily track the evolution of the brand as it changes over time. Other reliable standards are the Slim Dungarees, a slightly more durable pair of pants than the Futuredarts. Outlier probably has some of the most reliable mens shorts in the game in various cuts, which include an internal drawstring. My favorite pants of all are the Injected Linen Pants, an extremely breathable pair perfect for summer, stitched from a <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/injected-linen-pants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyester/linen</a> blend that is far more delicate than their standard fare but also leagues more practical than linen pants tend to be.</p><figure><figcaption>Injex is the Outlier's delicate fabric and my favorite, a slightly durable poly/linen blend that withstands more abuse than standard linen.</figcaption></figure><p>At the time of writing you’re looking at paying $125-$200 for a pair of shorts or pants, and be warned that if you decide to venture outside of the basics you will pay a hefty premium for it. That said, I have bought so many pairs of pants over the years, particularly from their seasonal grab bag sales dubbed “WTF” (you pay them 50 bucks, give them a waist size, and they send you something in that size), that I have a wardrobe in basically every waist size I have fit into.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Every time Outlier has roulette style sample sale I have bought a pair in basically every size I can fit in. </figcaption></figure><p>It is a strange thing to write about a company this way, but Outlier is, in a bit of nominative determinism, singular. They have held on to the 2010s direct to consumer model while many startups from that time have largely discarded this concept. Their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subreddit</a> benefitted from an <a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/from-radical-quality-to-reddit-how-fashion-brand-outlier-is-charting-its-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influx of traffic</a> that helped them build a following there and gave them a step up. This community would in turn help shape their tastes and give them feedback, and the board felt truly conversational for many years. Outlier embodied the zeitgeist of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techwear</a> community in its dedication to technical fabrics, although they have been generally much better at putting out pieces that don’t feel anchored to that movement and have in some ways outlived it. If you were to describe their current aesthetic, it would be a shockingly coherent venn diagram of rave wear, sensible office basics and LaKeith Stanfield’s wardrobe in the Netflix <em>Death Note </em>movie. That’s perfect because that’s how I dress most of the time anyway.</p><figure><figcaption>On top of basics, Outlier frequently has limited, experimental, and expensive drops. Guy Fieri shorts in space age linen? Fluorescent sun hoodies? It's always a joy to see. Credit: Outlier</figcaption></figure><p>The strangest part about following Outlier’s trajectory is how it has mirrored and informed my own obsessions with materials. Even outside of synthetics, they have a love of linen and merino from a purely technical perspective. Outlier is one of the only western companies I’ve seen that regularly makes clothes out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramie</a>, a Chinese bast fiber that is better at cooling than linen but that I have heard is a pain in the ass to work with. Outlier, like everyone else including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/our-dwr-problem/story-17791.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patagonia</a>, had to deal with the thorny issue of replacing PFAS for use in durable water repellents (also known as DWR), and following their trajectory as <a href="https://huntsman-pimcore.equisolve-dev.com/Documents/Zelan_R3_Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they figured out how to solve that</a> has been interesting as an enthusiast. Additionally, Outlier has historically had a fondness for <a href="https://www.polartec.com/fabrics/insulation/alpha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PolarTec Alpha</a>, an lightweight synthetic insulation that has the benefit of being highly breathable. PolarTec Alpha was used by Patagonia in its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822160605/https://www.patagonia.com/product/level-3a-jacket/19213.html?dwvar_19213_color=ALP&amp;cgid=web-specials-mens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Level 3A PCU</a> (Protective Combat Unit) jacket back when the company had more extensive collaborations with the US military. I bought that Patagonia jacket on clearance in part because Outlier was <a href="https://outlier.nyc/search?q=alpha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so obsessed with how well Alpha worked and has produced many garments with it</a>. The Level 3A has since become a mild collector’s item for guys who are obsessed with military gear, and I hate to say it is the closest thing I own to a perfect jacket.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Patagonia PCU Level 3A Light Loft Shell Wind Resistant Jacket" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqhiMhk8Bkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More than anything though, I am still shocked at how well their garments hold up. It’s not a flawless track record: I have a few garments with holes in some of the pockets, particularly from the time period when they moved to breathable mesh pockets which have some forgivable tradeoffs. The injected linen pants are as close as you can get to a perfect summer pant and have saved my ass in the 94 degree NYC heat, but they are slightly more frail than Outlier’s regular output by virtue of the material used. But those little exceptions to a rule exist side by side with a backlog of unkillable pants in my wardrobe, from the very baggy yet durable <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/bombdeux-standards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bombardeauxs</a> to the reliable <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/slim-dungarees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDs (Slim Dungarees)</a>, the closest thing Outlier has to a standard.&nbsp;</p><p>The other day during one of Aftermath’s editorial meetings, I told the rest of the site what I had been working on: a blog about a pair of pants. Prior to the meeting I had been doing some ambient farming of Citibike points for a few hours, cycling in a path that took me from Penn Station, past the cursed NYT building, through Times Square, down past Japan Society, and eventually taking the meeting on a bench in front of Stuyvusent Town. The day had gone from a dreary light rain to the oppressive summer armpit of a July in New York City. I was dehydrated and exhausted. As I told the Aftermath crew about “The Pants Blog,” I looked down and I saw that by pure coincidence I had done the entire ride in the green pants; the ones I love, that I had bought when Barack Obama was the president, and I smiled in the knowledge that I am still many years away from killing them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants]]></content:encoded>

But a fresh delay of one of the most wish-listed games on Steam makes that almost impossible. Publisher Krafton, which changed the release schedule against the objections of the studio’s founders, now denies that it did so to avoid paying the bonuses while also blaming them for the highly anticipated underwater survival sim missing its original target release date. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196299,195922" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>  “This decision was based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players,” the South Korea-based company which also owns<em> PUBG </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> in a statement responding to<em> Bloomberg</em>’s report. “It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations. Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds cofounders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill were fired last week, despite Krafton promising the studio independence when it was purchased back in 2022. Cleveland later wrote on Reddit that the game was ready to release in Early Access later this year as originally planned, calling the move from Krafton to replace the studio’s leadership a “shock.”</p><p>The publisher now says that the decision to delay <em>Subnautica 2 </em>grew out of negative feedback from playtests. “We received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game’s direction,” it wrote in its new statement. “At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release. As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience.”</p><p>Krafton was less diplomatic in a new statement published on its website Thursday afternoon which accused Cleveland and McGuire of refusing to return to their leadership roles on <em>Subnautica 2 </em>after the studio’s fantasy skirmish PVP game <em>Moonbreaker </em>struggled to find an audience in 2024. The publisher blamed them for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s failure to release in 2024 as originally planned:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them.<em> Subnautica 2</em> was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of <em>Moonbreaker</em>, Krafton  asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.<br>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.<br></p><p>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>The statement also said Krafton was “committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development,” though a spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately clarify what those bonuses would look like relative to the $250 million payout previously on the table. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A developer update posted on YouTube</a></span> confirmed<em> Subnautica 2 </em>would be coming to Early Access in 2025 back in April. It’s unclear what would have meaningfully changed in just two months to lead Krafton to overrule the studio’s leadership and replace them, which has now jeopardized fan enthusiasm for the game in the process. “<em>Subnautica</em>’s soul has just been ripped out,” one fan recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lpryrg/subnauticas_soul_has_just_been_ripped_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lpryrg/subnauticas_soul_has_just_been_ripped_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. </p><p><em>Subnautica</em> players have  started revolting on the game’s subreddit.

                <p>A new challenger is rising in the ranks. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/" data-ref-id="5000-524231">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, the free-to-play sports sim game about horse girls, is racing up the Steam charts. The gacha game has been garnering attention since its launch in North America in June, thanks in part to streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce. It hit its all-time-peak of just over 50,000 simultaneous players yesterday, July 9, and has been boasting new personal bests day after day.</p><p>To put that number in perspective, that is just over double the number of concurrent players at launch. The game is now squarely in the top 50 most-played games on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3224770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. That puts it in competition with games like Elden Ring Nightreign and Warframe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby has been a phenomenon in Japan for a while, spawning tie-in anime, spin-off party games, and even a stage play. The titular Umamusume are women with a horse's speed and strength--they also sport pointy ears and tails. During the day, they race. At night, they perform in lavish pop concerts for their fans. The kicker is that each of the girl is based on an actual famous race horse. One of them, a lovable loser named Haru Urara, is still alive and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans have taking to visiting her at the farm</a> where she now lives. The developer even put out a statement about proper etiquette for <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visiting a stable</a>. It's bizarre things like this, the kind of fact that you couldn't say about any other game, that seem to be fueling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume's word-of-mouth momentum</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are familiar with social simulation games like Princess Maker or Idol Manager, you'll understand the basics of how Umamusume: Pretty Derby plays. Each horse girl starts with a set of aptitudes and stats which you can enhance through training. At races, they can prove their mettle and, if they place high enough, progress to tougher challenges. But it's not all work. Training is frequently interrupted by visual-novel-esque segments and storylines. However, to unlock your horse girl of choice you will have to engage with the game's plentiful gambling mechanics. At its heart, Umamusume is a game about collecting jpegs. You might have to spend copious amounts of money to get the one you want.</p><p dir="ltr">You can play Umamusume for free on Steam or on your mobile device.</p>

<p>We miss you, Iwata-san</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/185f185d49ca8/satoru-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p><em>"On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer".</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>11th July 2025 marks the 10th anniversary of Satoru Iwata's passing; a man who cemented himself as not only an exceptional leader during times of both success and failure, but a figurehead that would steal the hearts of countless fans around the world.</p>
<p>It's difficult to really say anything that hasn't already been expressed at some point in the last decade, but we think it's clear that Iwata's presence continues to be felt in both Nintendo circles and the gaming industry at large. Indeed, with the recent news of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-layoffs-begin-as-phil-spencer-shares-internal-microsoft-gaming-update">extensive layoffs from Xbox and Microsoft</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">turmoil at studios across the world</a> over the last couple of years, many have recounted the words spoken by Iwata during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/stock/meeting/130627qa/03.html">shareholder Q&amp;A session</a> in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, however, employee morale will decrease, and I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iwata also paved the way for the Switch — Nintendo's most successful home console of all time — having worked extensively on the system before his passing in 2015. The effects of this are still felt to this very day, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic2ez3ZoKAk">Nvidia paying tribute to Iwata in a recent video</a> on the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still remember the day Iwata-san shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no-one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"We lost Iwata-san before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work everyday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years ago, former NL editor Tom Whitehead <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/feature_remembering_satoru_iwata_five_years_on">wrote about Iwata's career and his legacy</a>, and it's strange to think that a full decade has now passed - and to consider how the world has changed in that time. We wonder what Iwata would make of the state of the industry, of Switch's success, and of the brand new console we're enjoying.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is, well, thank you, Iwata-san. Nintendo would not be where it is today without your leadership, passion, and desire to deliver the very best experiences in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">last month</a>, the latest batch of DLC levels for Astro Bot have officially been added to the game today, and as an additional surprise, two iconic characters that are recognized by video game fans around the world have finally joined the roster of the cameo bots that players can collect in each level. </p>



<p>Today's update adds another five levels to Astro Bot, putting the total number of levels in Astro Bot over 90, but what's perhaps more significant to diehard PlayStation fans are two of the characters that have finally made their way into the game as cameo bots. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy's Cloud and Sephiroth are now part of the roster of cameo bots that players can collect in the five new levels available today. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable cameo bot inclusions are Atsu, the protagonist for Sucker Punch's upcoming follow-up to their 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, which is also due to have its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-july-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive/">own State of Play presentation</a> later today at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for collectors, there's no update regarding the other announcement from last month's Astro Bot news, which was the reveal of a new limited-edition Astro Bot-themed DualSense controller. For now, it's still due out "<em>later this year</em>," with no official release date revealed. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-layoffs-has-microsofts-studio-buying-strategy-failed.1240698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending a near-incomprehensible amount of money and resources on studio acquisitions, Microsoft is finally ready to make its mark on the gaming industry by...&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">firing another 9,000 workers, about 4% of its workforce</a>. While this latest wave of layoffs is not specific to the Xbox division, there were no shortage of victims in gaming-related products and services.</p>

<p>Notable casualties include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">an entire game studio, The Initiative</a>, as well as the cancellation of at least two publicly known projects, the <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild</em></a>. Other layoffs were reported at ZeniMax, King, and Turn 10, though the scale of these layoffs was not as fatal.</p>

<p>Some will undoubtedly be quick to point out that while the situation is unfortunate, <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild </em>have been in development for years with next to nothing to show for it. At the same time, it would be hard to imagine that anyone (especially Xbox fans) would feel particularly inspired by the layoffs--doubly so when an educated guess would suggest that Microsoft is doing these layoffs to chase the AI white whale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-activision-blizzard-bethesda.png?itok=8RXSUe1W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-activision-blizzard-bethesda.png?itok=_fR_VTMY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>So...when can we expect new games?</figcaption></figure><h2>Xbox: Buy Him Out, Boys!</h2>

<p>One might go so far as to say that Xbox's recent decisions give the impression that they are aimless. Despite the vast fortune spent on acquisitions, the general public is simply not seeing the deluge of new games that they might have been anticipating.</p>

<p>After all, Xbox has been acquiring game studios since 2002 with Rare. Mojang was their next big purchase in 2014. The money really started flying in 2018 with the addition of seven smaller studios, including Obsidian and Double Fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-studios" rel="nofollow">Xbox's own count</a>, acquiring Bethesda put them at 23 studios. However, the eventual closure of The Initiative, Alpha Dog Games, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Studios sets that number down to 19. The subsequent Activision Blizzard acquisition boosts them back up to 22 game studios, though it should be noted that Activision itself runs a number of studios, most notably Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games.</p>

<p>Xbox once boasted that by purchasing Bethesda, they can "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/officially-welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/" rel="nofollow">begin working together to deliver more great games to everyone</a>." Since then,&nbsp;Activision Blizzard was also acquired to help "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard/" rel="nofollow">create new worlds and stories</a>."</p>

<p>Bethesda has certainly been trying to deliver on that promise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/starfield-review-interstellar-adventure" rel="nofollow">albeit to mixed results</a>. Quality aside, the studios under Bethesda Softworks have consistently been putting out a new game about once a year, regularly rotating between their associated studios.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard on the other hand has not deviated much from its strategy of launching <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;ad infinitum. Of course, given that Activision Blizzard is in charge of genre-defining live-service properties like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and <em>Diablo</em>, there's not much of a rush to launch anything new. <em>Candy Crush's</em> popularity is not to be underestimated either seeing as how it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/candy-crush-saga-hits-20-billion-revenue-milestone-maker-king-says-2023-09-26/" rel="nofollow">made some $20 billion in revenue since 2012</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-flood-spartan.jpg?itok=lpf_uMDp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-flood-spartan.jpg?itok=otMxEN1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surely there's more than enough maps and modes now right?</figcaption></figure><p>The Coalition and Halo Studios are in somewhat unique positions, overseeing <em>Gears of War</em> and <em>Halo</em> respectively. These are supposed to be the traditional crown jewels of Xbox's first-party IPs, but it's been almost six years since a new game has been released under either banner.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite" rel="nofollow"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> started out strong in 2021, only to fizzle out due to an underwhelming quantity of post-launch multiplayer content. Xbox seemed to be getting ready to go on a <em>Gears of War </em>blitz with back to back releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-5" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears 5</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-tactics" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears Tactics</em></a>, except that never materialized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there's Playground Games, the studio behind the upcoming <em>Fable</em>. The game probably isn't dead, although there hasn't been much gameplay footage since it was announced in 2020, so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Mojang appears to be the only group that is showing signs of life. Between the recent release of a <em>Minecraft </em>movie and a couple of spin-off games, <em>Minecraft </em>is clearly the most active of the major Xbox properties.</p>

<h2>Xbox: Obsidian Entertainment's New Best Friend?</h2>

<p>Even so, the latest round of layoffs didn't leave Xbox's supposed big guns unscathed as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say" rel="nofollow">ZeniMax was forced to shelve an original MMO that they were working on</a>. Rare is evidently not allowed to touch anything other than <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sea-of-thieves" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> as they were working on <em>Everwild </em>before it was cancelled.&nbsp;Turn 10 lost half of its team despite the fact that they are partly in charge of the <em>Forza </em>franchise, though given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440510/Forza_Motorsport/" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Motorsport's</em></a> lackluster user reviews, this might've happened eventually anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Undead Labs has been radio silent as well. Under normal circumstances, this is hardly unusual, but one should no longer hold their breath when it comes to <em>State of Decay 3</em> given the recent layoffs.</p>

<p>That being said, the&nbsp;comparatively smaller companies have seemingly fared better under Xbox.&nbsp; World's Edge is doing a fairly good job at handling the <em>Age of Empires</em> franchise, having released both <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/age-of-empires-iv" rel="nofollow"><em>Age of Empires IV</em></a> and <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em>.&nbsp;Compulsion Games just released <em>South of Midnight</em> to favorable user and critic reviews.</p>

<p>Ninja Theory's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a> won a couple of accolades at The Game Awards last year. Meanwhile, Double Fine is set to release <em>Keeper</em>&nbsp;in October, and inXile Entertainment's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow"><em>Clockwork Revolution</em></a> looks promising as well.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is outright thriving. Since its acquisition in 2018, Obsidian launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pentiment" rel="nofollow"><em>Pentiment</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avowed" rel="nofollow"><em>Avowed</em></a>--four very different games of consistently high quality launched at reasonable intervals with room for sequels. In fact, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is set to release in October.</p>

<p>Alas, even with the success of these smaller studios, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown of Tango Gameworks</a> in spite of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush's</em>&nbsp;overwhelmingly positive reception</a> is recent enough to be in the back of everyone's mind.</p>

<h2>Xbox: But What About the Hardware?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-remake-cloud.jpg?itok=sxuEnY5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-remake-cloud.jpg?itok=jIrXUt9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>On the bright side, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox!</figcaption></figure><p>While it would be unrealistic to expect every individual studio to follow in Obsidian's footsteps, it doesn't seem that unreasonable for Xbox fans to ask for a reason to remain Xbox fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The annual <em>Call of Duty </em>and Bethesda game can be played on any platform. The next <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Elder Scrolls </em>are years away at best.&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> have been missing in action for almost six years. <em>Fable </em>was delayed until 2026. There are barely any new first-party IPs, much less anything that can move consoles.</p>

<p>Console sellers are a moot point anyways because Xbox is being hopelessly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024" rel="nofollow">outsold in hardware</a>. The only advantage that is left is Game Pass. The normalization of the $80 price tag plays directly into Xbox's hand by offering people an affordable alternative to buying games.</p>

<p>This holiday season is the perfect time to put this notion to the ultimate test with the releases of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Keeper</em>. One first-party game from a solid developer, one exclusive third-party game, and one relatively quirky game representing the vast majority of games that you could find in the Game Pass library. If those three games can convince people to sign up for Game Pass en masse, then a pivot to subscription services might not seem like a fool's errand after all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this sole advantage might be ceded too if Microsoft decides to up the price of Game Pass any further. We are already at a stage where only the most expensive tier of subscribers can actually play new games on launch day. If affordable games aren't enough to move consoles, then raising the price is the only surefire way to lose the remaining players over time.</p>

<h2>Xbox: More Money Please</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elder-scrolls-online-molag-bal.jpg?itok=9hxtYRJC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elder-scrolls-online-molag-bal.jpg?itok=DmUzdZFB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If an MMO was so bad that it had to be scrapped before it even had a publicly known name, surely it's not too late to salvage parts of it for some other project</figcaption></figure><p>Keep in mind that none of this is happening in a vacuum. According to Microsoft's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow">fiscal year earnings press release from April 30</a>, their net income was $25.8 billion, with Xbox content and services seeing an increased revenue of 8%. By comparison,&nbsp;Sony claims that it had a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sony.pdf" rel="nofollow">net income of 980 billion yen</a> (approximately US$6.7 billion) in 2024 and that its gaming and network services division <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/sony-earnings-q3-2025.html" rel="nofollow">enjoyed 16% year-over-year growth</a>. This suggests that PlayStation is continuing its dominance in spite of Xbox's acquisitions and apparent shifts to subscription services.</p>

<p>In any case, this would imply that Microsoft's recent cuts and layoffs weren't exactly life saving for the company, further lending credence to the idea that this is all to fuel Microsoft's AI push. If anything, it looks like Xbox's first-party developers and Game Pass are managing to keep the brand afloat, because it's definitely not because of console sales. Furthermore, if the layoffs and project cancellations were necessary from a financial standpoint, this brings up the question of why wasn't someone cancelling these projects earlier.</p>

<p><em>Everwild </em>was in development for a decade. Unless Rare was sitting on the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> tier game, there's no excuse for any game to be in development for so long with nothing to show the public. Similarly, there's no reason for <em>Perfect Dark</em> to have been on life support for half a decade with barely any gameplay to show for it.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/redfall" rel="nofollow">Redfall</a> </em>which should've never been released at all, or at least delayed and completely remade so that it matched the strengths of the studio.</p>

<p>Xbox then flipped to the other extreme by axing ZeniMax's new MMO while it was still in the crib. The game showed promise according to internal tests, and given ZeniMax's resume, there's no particular reason to doubt such claims.&nbsp;Nonetheless, it gives the impression that Xbox has no idea what it's doing when it comes to making games.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Xbox: Oh, I Didn't Get Rich By Writing a Lot of Checks</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-space-mansion.jpg?itok=1W96MJfb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-space-mansion.jpg?itok=tZ7FlzwO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remember kids, if you work hard, one day you too will be able afford your own (picture of) a mansion in space!</figcaption></figure><p>If anything, this puts all the blame at the hands of Microsoft and Xbox's leadership. At the end of the day, even with whatever was going on with <em>Everwild </em>and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>&nbsp;and all the money Microsoft spent on Game Pass and studio acquisitions, Xbox still turned a profit by its own admission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That last point cannot be repeated enough. As expensive as Activision Blizzard and Bethesda and all the other gaming studios and Game Pass partnerships were, Xbox still made money. Perhaps it wasn't as much money as its main competitor, but the game studios accomplished the only goal that matters in capitalism, and it still wasn't enough to save some of the workers from being laid off and their projects cancelled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incidentally, this sandwiches&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's CEO massive 63% raise</a>&nbsp;between two huge waves of layoffs, as if he was somehow outputting the value of almost 12,000 workers singlehandedly. Microsoft's wealth can't possibly have come from its workers, no, it must've fallen from the heavens as a gift for chasing "AI" projects.&nbsp;The workers merely sell their labor to produce everything, run everything, and maintain everything, then suffer the most regardless of how a business performs. What possible use can they have in making a company profitable?</p>

The presence of this new mechanic means that drifting next to someone no longer means you’re out of the danger zone. On the flipside, you can now hit someone mid-flight on Rainbow Road even if they’re not directly in front of you. This hidden change marks a huge difference for player strategy; however, some cumbersome controls need to be mastered first.</p><h2 id="h16023"><a id=""></a>How to throw items in any direction</h2><p>Nearly every throwable item goes forward by default when you press R. Moving the left stick down while pressing R will have your character throw the item backward instead. The one exception to this is Bananas, which go backward by default and forward when moving the left stick up and pressing R.</p><p>Given that the left stick primarily functions for turning, it won’t be much help for firing anything to the side. The trick is to have access to two. <strong>If you want to throw items freely in any direction, move the camera with the right stick and then press R.</strong> They’ll be tossed wherever the camera’s pointing.</p><p>There are a couple of unfortunate issues with this. The first is that you will need to be using a pair of Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller. You’re limited to throwing items forward or backward when using a single Joy-Con. The second issue is that using the right stick is a clunky experience. Not only is the stick sensitivity pretty slow, but moving the right stick while pressing A is extremely uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842">What Do Smart Steering And Auto-Accelerate Do In <em>Mario Kart World</em>?</a></span></p><p>Those who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842">use Auto-Acceleration</a></span> are bound to have the easiest time with this since their thumb will be free.

The first trailer of the season gives us our best look yet—and he looks incredible.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197556" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="210" data-playlist="197556,197583,197589" data-current="197556"><div><p>GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23080.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the chaotic trailer, sadistic ringleader Calypso (Anthony Carrigan) introduces this season’s characters to his Twisted Metal tournament, where the winner is granted any wish they desire. Once those stakes are established, all bets are off. We see Sweet Tooth launching missiles, John (Anthony Mackie) dodging lightning bolts, and Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz) slicing a man open in a way that’s somehow seductive. But we’d already seen most of that in the Season 2 clip released last month. What did shock us was Axel steamrolling through the competition.</p><p>Back in April, Smith explained that Axel didn’t appear in the first season because they hadn’t yet solved one crucial challenge: “How do you do a character that is literally a giant muscular man stuck between two gigantic wheels?” Thankfully, they figured it out. Using a custom-built apparatus that, according to Smith, weighed a ton and required its own trailer, the bipedal beast finally joins the fray this season. While we don’t get a full close-up of Axel with his hands embedded in the massive wheels, we do see actor Michael James Shaw laughing sinisterly, with a clear shot of the mechanical rig strapping one of his arms to the wheel. By the looks of it, the <em>Twisted Metal</em> design team spared no expense in making him look real.</p><p>The War Wheel titan is seen racing alongside other vehicles—clearly aided by visual effects—but fans of the <em>Twisted Metal</em> games will appreciate the final result when the new season debuts on Peacock on July 31. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/twisted-metal-season-2-peacock-axel-anthony-mackie-1851786052]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The rollout of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-as-new-trailer-debuts/1100-6533088/" data-ref-id="1100-6533088">the latest trailer for Subnautica 2</a> hasn't gone very smoothly for Unknown Worlds and its parent company, Krafton. Instead of admiring the new footage, fans are laser-focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">the forced exits of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> and a subsequent report that Subnautica 2's delay may cause the Unknown Worlds team to lose out on a promised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">$250 million bonus</a>. That led to some players calling for a boycott of Subnautica 2, which has in turn led to an eye-opening statement from Krafton claiming that the "inevitable leadership change [was] driven by project abandonment."</p><p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Unknown Worlds' entire team was reportedly going to receive a share of a $250 million bonus if the company hit its financial goals in 2025. Those goals may have been predicated on Subnautica 2 receiving an early-access release this year. A poster on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lvyc7f/do_not_buy_subnautica_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> contends that, "This delay is simply so [Krafton doesn't] have to give those bonuses. They've already made $250 million dollars off of scamming developers. Don't let them make more."</p><p>The Reddit post was initially locked and has now been removed by moderators of the Subnautica subreddit. It had amassed more than 45,000 upvotes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK5Nr1VtJ9Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Charlie Cleveland--one of the recently ousted founders of Unknown Worlds--has stated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">that Subnautica 2 is ready</a> for an early-access release. But he added that the decision is now in Krafton's hands, with the plan now being for Subnautica 2 to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p><p>Following an initial, less-specific statement attempting to explain the recent moves, Krafton has responded with a lengthier, scorched-earth statement in an attempt to provide further rationale for the move, including how it impacts potential bonuses for staffers.</p><p>Krafton specifically addresses its $500 million purchase price of Unknown Worlds, saying it had apportioned 90% of a $250 million payout to three now-former executives "with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2." It contends the three "abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them."</p><p>"Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed," the statement continues. "Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max [McGuire] to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>"Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule," it added, saying the unreleased early-access version "falls short in terms of content volume."</p><p>"We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership's conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans," it said.</p><p>Regarding the bonuses, Krafton said, "We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica's ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised."</p><p>Exactly what it's committing to is unclear. When asked for clarification, a spokesperson told GameSpot, "Krafton is working on a fair and equitable compensation for those who have contributed to Subnautica 2's continued development. We recognize that their dedication and effort are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution. We will have further details going forward."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Cleveland for comment and will report back if the former studio leadership addresses these allegations.</p>
