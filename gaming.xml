		<p>The classic (depending on your point of view) Marvel vs Capcom fighting games are return in one collection, backed up with a couple of Marvel only titles. The ridiculously named MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is coming to coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Steam later this year. You will note that Xbox players are left out, and there’s no specific PS5 version either.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLS4-W4Yq84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The games are:</p>
<p>– X-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM<br>
– MARVEL SUPER HEROES<br>
– X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER<br>
– MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER<br>
– MARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES<br>
– MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes<br>
– THE PUNISHER</p>

<p>As usual there are a bunch of enhancements for the games including custom matches, spectator features, museum, music player, various display filters, one-button special moves and the ability to save and load the game at any point you wish. “Rollback netcode will make online battles even smother”, add <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/capcom/">Capcom.</a> The game will not have cross play support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom released its second <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> Direct, where Game Director Joel Bylos revealed more details of the upcoming survival MMO.</p>
<p>To start with, we learned that following the previous limited Closed Beta events, Dune: Awakening has recently entered the persistent Closed Beta phase, which is obviously a step toward the full release, allowing testers to check out the whole game. There's still no word on the launch, although Funcom has already promised an 'epic' gameplay reveal at Gamescom, and that might be the venue for such announcements.</p>
<p>Throughout the Dune: Awakening Direct, the studio showed the character creation tool, where players choose not only how their character looks but also their background, including their mentor's specialization, such as Mentat, Bene Gesserit, Trooper, and Swordmaster.</p>
<p>However, the juiciest part of the video was the overview of the world structure. Funcom explained that there is a top-down Overland map connecting the various huge maps, one of which supports hundreds of players at once. This choice allows the studio to expand the game more easily in the future with additional playable spaces than it could have with a single map. If you're interested in the full breakdown of how the MMO component of Dune: Awakening works, here's the excerpt from Bylos.</p>
<p><em>When players start to play Dune: Awakening, they choose a world. It's almost like choosing a server in an MMORPG, but it's a large infrastructure of connected servers. The idea is that as a player, you choose, you join, you start in a map, and from there, your experience should be relatively seamless in terms of how you explore and feel the world.</em></p>
<p><em>The reason we call it a survival MMO, as opposed to just a survival game, is that most survival games do one map, one server. But we have multiple connected servers running in a single world, and it also allows us to have a lot more players in this structure.</em></p>
<p><em>When you join the game, you start in the Hagga Basin map, which has a server with a minimum of 40 other players. It's a place where you can build, craft, survive, progress. If you want to play specifically with friends, you want to join the same version of Hagga Basin because it can have multiple versions. And then from there, you move outwards. </em></p>
<p><em>I can select which Hagga Basin I'm starting with. So if we start in Dune: Awakening at the same time, I can make sure that we're spawning in the same. Not only that, our server browser also tells you where your friends are playing. </em><em>Once you're ready to leave the Hagga Basin, you craft yourself an ornithopter and you fly out into what's called the Overland map, which allows you to see all the locations in the world. You physically fly between locations on the Overland map.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_OverlandMap_Infographic.gif"></a></figure>

<p><em>One of those options are the social hubs, Harko Village and Arrakeen, which are differently themed based on the different factions in the game. These are safe spaces, peaceful by the Canley Peace. There are bars, vendors, and home exchanges.&nbsp;And of course, you and your friends can go dancing in the clubs.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Then you'll go back to the Overland map and you'll fly to the Deep Desert. The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>

<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-will-be-released-when-its-ready-as-funcom-wants-to-reduce-its-famous-jank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of a release window,</a> Dune: Awakening remains on our radar as one of the most promising multiplayer games. It will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though we don't know yet if it'll support cross-play.</p>

Meanwhile, watching from my desktop is Mustard, my new digital pet. He’s from a different game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/weyrdlets&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/weyrdlets"><em>Weyrdlets</em></a></span>, and he’s hanging out with me as I work and play games on my PC. After killing some guards in <em>Selaco</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>I make sure to pet Mustard before reloading and getting back into the mayhem. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196539" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="278" data-playlist="196539,193379,191355" data-current="196539"><div><p>This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22094.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Mustard, a little pink lizard-like creature I created and named, is a good companion.  I wanted to know more about how he came to be and what it’s like making an indie game in 2024. So I spoke to Weyrdworks, the devs behind <em>Weyrdlets</em>, to find out how this game works and how you break through among all the other new games launching on Steam every day.</p><p>“<em>Weyrdlets </em>is a cozy virtual pet game centered around a community and a simulated virtual world of colorful characters,” explained game director Shawn Beck. “There aren’t any real objectives or goals to achieve. It’s all about caring for a pet in a wholesome community of friends. Think of it as a desktop companion that’s also an idle game.”</p><p>According to the game’s art director, JT Yean, <em>Weyderlets</em> was inspired by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a></span>, a game that is also mostly about vibes and chilling with cute critters. Yean says that Weyrdlets is meant to “fade into the background” as you do other things on your PC. </p><p>“Think Microsoft Clippy, but better,” adds social media specialist Wing Yee. </p><h2 id="h1387"><a id=""></a>A little digital friend on your big screen</h2><p>While you can play <em>Weyderlets </em>like any other game—with it taking over your screen as you help build a new home for your pet, train them, and play with them—the coolest feature of this virtual pet sim is when you free your buddy and let them run around on your desktop as you do other things. </p><p>According to Beck, the team had wanted to make a virtual pet game for some time but didn’t have a “hook” for it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-fan-game-unleashes-havoc-on-your-desktop-1841351806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-fan-game-unleashes-havoc-on-your-desktop-1841351806"><em>Desktop Goose</em> and other games</a></span> that put characters on your desktop helped guide the team. </p><p>“It’s not a new concept, for sure,” said Beck. “But we’ve tried a lot of other desktop pet games, and they were more toys than games. It just seemed like there was more to explore.”<br></p><p>The team says balancing the virtual pet on your desktop was tricky. The cute pet needs to require some of your attention, you’ll sometimes need to feed it or pet it, but they always had to make sure your cute critter never felt annoying. </p><p>How this all works, according to the devs, is that <em>Weyrdlets </em>is running on screen with a transparent background. So you can see and interact with your desktop as your virtual pet runs around and demands food. In my time with <em>Weyrdlets</em>, I’ve never been annoyed by Mustard, even when he would wander in front of my emails. And I was always able to get work done, watch videos, or play other games, too. </p><h2 id="h1388"><a id=""></a>Getting people to play your new game in 2024</h2><p>Of course, in 2024, even a cute virtual pet game inspired by <em>Animal Crossing</em> might struggle to find an audience. I asked the team if they were concerned about being buried by all the other <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/steam-breaks-another-annual-record-launching-more-than-14000-games-in-2023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/steam-breaks-another-annual-record-launching-more-than-14000-games-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big and small releases that seemingly launch every day on Steam</a></span>. </p><p>“We’re worried all the time,” admitted Beck. “Really, all we can do is put our best foot forward and build something focused on bringing value to our players. Though I hope being in a niche space of virtual pets will help separate us from the noise.”</p><figure id="" data-id="4edd54d99b5f18892d46edd0eabc9163" data-recommend-id="image://4edd54d99b5f18892d46edd0eabc9163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="914" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone playing Weyrdlets.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for tips for other devs out there who hope to make something good that people actually find and play, Yean advised teams to “always share your work,” and get as much feedback as possible. “Player feedback has been immensely valuable to us,” added Beck.<br></p><p>“It’s also nice to be able to include the community in the credits,” said Yee. “I wish more games did this. I’m still new to the games industry, but being involved in the development of a game is really exciting, whether you’re on the dev team or cheering from the sidelines.”<br></p><p>Assuming Weyrdworks is able to get people playing and enjoying its desktop pet sim, the team has big plans for the future, including a soccer mode and more. </p><p>“<em>Weyrdlets </em>is a continuously evolving game, meaning it will continue to receive updates, events, minigames, and other exciting features even after launch,” said Yee. “The fun never stops.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Weyrdlets </em>launches on July 23</a></span>. A Mac version of the game will arrive sometime after launch. You can currently download and play a free demo of the game on Steam. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PC gamers of a certain vintage will remember tales of <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">Project Van Buren</a>, a title that early '00s Interplay intended as the sequel to 1998's hit <em>Fallout 2</em>. Now, original <em>Fallout</em> producer Timothy Cain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag">is sharing some behind-the-scenes details</a> about how he contributed to the project's cancellation during a particularly difficult time for publisher Interplay.</p>
<p>Cain famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfaCXEu0tE&amp;t=0s">left Interplay during <em>Fallout 2</em>'s development</a> in the late '90s to help form <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2005/02/games-20050219/">short-lived</a> RPG house <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q3/arcanum/arcanum.html">Troika Games</a>. After his departure, though, he was still in touch with some people from his former employer, including an unnamed Interplay vice president looking for some outside opinions on the troubled Van Buren project.</p>
<p>"Would you mind coming over and playing one of my game prototypes?" Cain recalls this vice president asking him sometime in mid-2003. "We're making a <em>Fallout</em> game and I'm going to have to cancel it. I don't think they can get it done... but if you could come over and look at it and give me an estimate, that's a chance I wouldn't cancel it."</p>

<p>Cain recalls walking "across the street" from Troika to the Interplay offices, motivated to help because, as he remembers it, "if you don't do it, bad things will happen to other people." There, he got to see the latest build of Project Van Buren, running on <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jefferson_Engine">the 3D Jefferson Engine</a> that was intended to replace the sprite-based isometric view of the first two <em>Fallout</em> games. Cain said the version he played was similar or identical to <a href="https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/van-burens-technical-demo.71/history">a tech demo obtained by fan site No Mutants Allowed in 2007</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD-LCsIiw2g&amp;t=0s">featured in a recent YouTube documentary</a> about the failed project.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>After playing for about two hours and talking to the team behind the project, Cain said the VP asked him directly how long the demo needed to become a shippable game. The answer Cain reportedly gave—18 months of standard development for "a really good game" or 12 months of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/05/the-death-march-the-problem-of-crunch-time-in-game-development/">"death march" crunch time</a> for an unbalanced, buggy mess—was too long for the financially strapped publisher to devote to funding the project.
</p><p>"He could not afford a development period of more than six months," Cain said. "To me, that time frame was out of the question... He thought it couldn't be done in six months; I just confirmed that."</p>
<h2>Show me the money</h2>
<p>Looking back today, Cain said it's hard to pinpoint a single "villain" responsible for Van Buren's failure. Even reusing the engine from the first <em>Fallout</em> game—as the <em>Fallout 2</em> team did for that title's quick 12-month development process—wouldn't have necessarily helped, Cain said. "Would that engine have been acceptable five years later [after <em>Fallout 2</em>]?" he asked rhetorically. "Had anyone really looked at it? I started the engine in 1994... it's creaky."</p>

<p>In the end, Van Buren's cancellation (and that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/04/interplays-fallout-mmo-may-not-see-light-of-day/">a planned Interplay <em>Fallout</em> MMO</a> years later) simply "comes down to money," Cain said. "I do not believe that [with] the money they had left, the game in the state it was in, and the people who were working on it could have completed it within six months," he said. "And [if they did], I don't think it would have been a game you would have liked playing."
</p><p>Luckily, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/interplay-offices-closed-by-state-officials/1100-6100019/">all-but-name shuttering of Interplay</a> in the years after Van Buren's cancellation wouldn't spell the end of the <em>Fallout</em> series. Bethesda <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/bethesda-obtains-fallout-ip/">acquired the license in 2007</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/fallout-3-review/">a completely reimagined <em>Fallout 3</em></a> that has become the cornerstone of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">a fan-favorite franchise</a> many years later. But for those still wondering what' Interplay's original "Fallout 3" could have been, a group of fans is <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">trying to rebuild the Project Van Buren demo from the ground up</a> for modern audiences.</p>

<section><p>Dune: Awakening looks to have a huge game map, and as you search for scarce resources, you'll potentially have to fight other players to claim them.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We've heard a lot about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-dune-awakening-youll-fight-to-survive-sandworms-political-machinations-and-other-players/1100-6521543/" data-ref-id="1100-6521543">survival aspect</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>--such as the way you'll need to conserve water, stay out of the baking Arrakis sun, and carefully avoid ever-present sandworms. While it seems that staying alive on the least hospitable planet in the universe will take up a lot of your attention, the other part of Dune: Awakening is a slate of MMO elements, including the way you'll tangle with other players who are also doing their best to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Fancom gave a hands-off demonstration of Dune: Awakening during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, giving a quick new look at the survival MMO and particularly showing off a bit of its moment-to-moment gameplay. While we didn't get to play the game ourselves, we did see it <em>being</em> played, which gave a sense of the fact that while you're completing quests and keeping yourself alive, there will be times when you've got to contend with other players who might want what you have.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo picked up right after the player had cleared out an underground ecology lab, one of the locations that serves as Dune: Awakening's equivalent to a dungeon. We were told that this character was in about the midgame, around 60 hours in, having gone beyond basic survival to gather and craft elements like a suspensor belt--a special bit of levitation technology that allowed them to make very high jumps and to float down from high locations unscathed--and an ornithopter, a flying vehicle for getting around. Leaving the dungeon, the player jumped right into their ornithopter, lifted it up, and transitioned out of the dungeon and out into the desert at large.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the Hagga Basin, which looks like it'll be a main focus of much of Dune: Awakening, at least early on. As social and economic director Matt Woodward explained during the demo, the location supports around 40 players in an instance, and is made up of a variety of different locations. There are places like the lab, expanses of desert, and villages or outposts you can visit. The ornithopter did a pass over a few different parts of the location, including the open desert, where we landed for a quick look around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321239"></a><figcaption>Ornithopters are a good way to get around the desert without attracting sandworm attention, but everything else is vulnerable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Frank Herbert's novel, the desert isn't uniform--the sand can sometimes compress to conduct sound extremely well, known as drum sand, and we also saw a bubbling area where subsurface liquid created quicksand. The player used the suspensor belt to jump free of the quicksand before sinking, but as all Dune fans know, messing around with that technology attracts the worm--which showed up a few seconds later. It was back to the ornithopter to avoid being eaten. Sandworms are a big hazard in Dune: Awakening, because while you retain your gear if you're killed by other means, anything on you when you're eaten by a sandworm (along with vehicles or anything else that gets consumed) is gone forever.</p><p dir="ltr">Next, the demo took us to a non-combat zone: a Harkonnen base. In this playthrough, the player had sided with the Harkonnen faction, making them allies to the great house but enemies with anyone loyal to the Atreides, the house of Dune's usual protagonists. The base, Woodward said, was created using the same building system that Dune: Awakening makes available to characters, with only a few developer-specific pieces. The gist is that you'll be able to construct your own bases and dwellings at the same level of quality as the developers, if you want.</p><p dir="ltr">The Harkonnen base was a spot where the player could pick up quests or talk to NPCs if they wanted to. This is also the kind of place where you can talk to trainer characters who can unlock new abilities for your character. You choose a role at the start of the game, like being a human computer called a Mentat, a swordmaster, or a Bene Gesserit who can deploy special abilities like the mind-controlling Voice. But you're not limited to just the abilities and skill trees you get when you choose your starting conditions. In the Harkonnen base, the demo showed us the Mentat trainer, who can help you start unlocking Mentat abilities for your character so you can mix and match how you play.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaving the Harkonnen base by grabbing another vehicle, a land-based buggy, we headed to a new location: a crashed spaceship. The ship had smashed through the surface of Arrakis and was located deep in a gorge. It was full of valuable stuff, so the Harkonnens and the Atreides had each set up a base at one end of the gorge, hoping to protect the wreck itself from the other faction. That had resulted in something of a stalemate between the two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321240"></a><figcaption>Which social spaces you can enter, like Harko Village, is determined by your faction alignment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The gorge was a good demonstration of the way locations are laid out in Dune: Awakening. The Harkonnen base is a non-combat area, essentially a social location. Outside of it, in the gorge, is a "Limited Warfare" area, which consists of PvE gameplay, where you'll take down enemy soldiers and NPCs. The shipwreck itself, however, is a "War of Assassins" area, named after the larger conflict between the Atreides and the Harkonnen--a full PvP zone.</p><p dir="ltr">The reason for that is because the shipwreck contains valuable, one-of-a-kind schematics you can use to create new gear. Venturing into the ship, your goal is to find that schematic and leave with it. In this case, it allowed the crafting of a new, powerful rifle, but since there's only one schematic in the shipwreck at a time, in order to liberate it for yourself, you'll have to deal with anyone else who's also trying to take it. The demo obviously didn't have anyone else contending for that schematic, but in the live game, heading into locations like this will be a risk.</p><p dir="ltr">Woodward explained that, when you get the schematic out of the ship and can craft the item, you'll get precisely one of them. If you want another rifle, you'll have to repeat the process of finding the schematic and getting it home safely. That gives you some economic power, though, allowing you to sell the schematic or the rifle to other players and charging the kind of price that a tough-to-get item like that should command.</p><p>The playthrough of the demo ended after leaving the crashed ship, but Woodward gave a little more context of just how large we can expect Dune: Awakening to be. The Hagga Basin, he said, is comparable to the size of Conan: Exile's map, about 64 square kilometers. Dune: Awakening will also have social locations like the capital city of Arrakeen, and the Harkonnen town Harko Village. Leaving the Hagga Basin by ornithopter takes you to an overworld map that lets you travel between major locales.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321241" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321241"></a><figcaption>The overworld map allows you to move between different major locations, like Hagga Basin and the deep desert.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And then there's the deep desert--the high-level PvP area where you're seemingly going to put a lot of effort. Forming groups and guilds, you'll head into the deep desert to harvest spice, search labs, and find wrecked ships, among other things. Just like in the wrecked ship, you'll potentially fight other players as you try to claim unique schematics in the deep desert each week. Woodward said that the deep desert is the size of three of the 8-kilometer by 8-kilometer Hagga Basin map. Each week, a Coriolis Storm will reset the whole area, so not only are you going to be revisiting it over and over, but it's going to be a huge area that will take a while to explore after each sweep.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the demo only lasted a few minutes, it still gave an interesting new take on Dune: Awakening, and in particular, how the game's survival and MMO elements are going to work and meld together. There's still a lot of the game we need to see in action, and the demo only gave quick looks at things like actually exploring and interacting with the desert, or engaging in combat--which seems like it can be pretty different from one player to the next, depending on what path you decide to take. But the ideas of questing, surviving, and fighting other players for cool, finite resources all sound like intense and fun additions to Dune: Awakening and great uses of the Dune setting. We'll have to keep waiting to see even more, but what Funcom has shown so far looks promising.</p>

Wood:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Hi, I’m Matt T. Wood. I’ve been in the games industry since 1998. Before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I was at Valve for sixteen years where I wore a plethora of hats and worked on games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Left 4 Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Portal 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Counter-Strike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In 2019, I decided to strike it out on my own and founded Double Dagger Studio. A handful of years later, we launched our first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> hasn’t been out very long but already has quite a bit of buzz around it! Your promotional game is top-notch. Would you care to pass along some tips?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I am a big believer in creating things with the intention to sell them. That means thinking about the marketability and brand early on in the development process. Asking yourself things like, “what is interesting about this game that people will be attracted to?” and “how can I visually present the brand in a way that will catch people's eyes and stand out in a group of others?” That way, it makes it a lot easier when the time comes to put eyeballs in front of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are a lot of very simple tricks to get people to look at your game (that honestly, I think people should be using more). One is just always having a full frame face somewhere on your branding. People are naturally attracted to faces and eyes. In my case, I guess it doesn't hurt that it's a cute little kitty, haha. But I remember reading articles where a group tracked peoples eyes as they scanned a website or a magazine, and they were always attracted to the faces first. And if I can use that trick to get their attention, well then the hard part comes and I have to keep it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For promoting the game, I mostly stuck to one platform, Twitter. It fit my style and my schedule to just throw things up there on a whim as I was working on them without thinking about it too much. The other social media sites require a lot more time, effort, and planning, and since I’m also making the game, this wasn’t really a good use of my time, in my opinion!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But later in the project, I was able to work with the wonderful folks at popagenda who helped me get so many more media opportunities. And then I was able to hire a great social media person, Shan Moran. I really wanted a social media person who could not only make the posts, but make cartoons and art for them as well. Shan was perfect for this.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It’s tempting to compare </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> with the other big cat game, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stray</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, but really other than featuring a cat the two have little in common. The gameplay is particularly refreshing: there is no health meter, no dangers, no lives and in fact no fail state. Do you think you have trouble engaging the player when there’s no “stakes?”</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Keeping the player engaged was certainly a concern of mine. My experience in engaging the player in the past was partly through conflict and partly through puzzle design. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does have a few light puzzles, there is no heavy conflict so this was brand new territory for me as a designer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This also brings up a point that I stumbled on about halfway through development. I find that when I play RPGs, I never do the main quests and just meander around letting myself get distracted by all the side quests and activities. Exploring and doing everything but the thing I'm supposed to be doing is what makes me happy. I guess it's no wonder then that I got diagnosed with Inattentive Type ADHD last year at the age of 47.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So anyway….this is how I ended up iteratively designing the structure of the game, and once I realized what was forming, it became obvious. The game was a game about distractions. I made the main quest fairly easy to achieve, but we encourage the player to feel free to just go explore over there or get distracted by that thing without worrying about time or pressure or nagging. Just go meander and have fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To follow up from that, there not being any way you can harm the cat helps make the game feel much more like a playground. That, and the light jazz soundtrack, give the experience a joyful and playful feeling, which is essential in allowing the player the freedom to try things out without risking danger. Did the lack of overt danger limit the design, was it always planned that way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So actually, I knew I wanted to make a “chill” game, but my first instinct and the first prototype was a survival-like game. The idea being that you actually needed to survive on the street, you needed food and water, and there was a day cycle. I played with that for a bit before I realized I had strayed too far from my original goals, and it wasn’t something I could make interesting without forcing the kitty to struggle and eventually fail. The more I thought about it and the more I explained it to my family and friends, the more I realized that seeing a little kitty struggle, fail, or get hurt was not something people would want to experience. So I pivoted. Then it was just a matter of figuring out what you did in the game if there was no fail state or conflicts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I knew from the start that I wanted to make a game that I could play with my kids. I had my goals, which were to encourage exploration, don't hurt Kitty, and encourage curiosity and discovery. And I had some ideas, but since this was mostly new territory for me, I looked towards some other great games that had no-conflict fun. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, aspects of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, parts of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and a slew of PC indie games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Short Hike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pikuniku</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slime Rancher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, all the Sokpop games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donut County</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">….I could go on, but all of these ended up being great inspirations for me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The jazz soundtrack felt like an obvious choice. Cats have always had an association with jazz, and the composer, Riley Koenig, took all my crazy, disconnected inspirations and created the perfect, playful soundtrack for the game.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another game that seems an inspiration is </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>: not only is playful mischief possible, prevalent and prominent, but the faceless human characters seems like they might even be Japanese counterparts to the English/Australian villagers of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, just another town in the same world. Is this intentional, and how does not depicting human faces help in characterizing them?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I think most cat owners can relate to sometimes feeling like the cat is the one really in charge, and we’re just here to provide food, shelter, and attention. I wanted to bring that perspective, which is why the human characters are fairly simple and don’t have faces. To cats, humans are just moving objects in the background. And when you give something a face, people tend to empathize with that thing more and I didn't want players to associate more with the humans than the animals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From an artistic perspective, the more detailed an object is, the more attention a player is going to give it. Since the humans are just “moving objects”, it made sense to keep their models simple and similar to the environment as opposed to the animal characters which are much more detailed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Open world games seem difficult to make with small teams. To make a</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> or </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, Nintendo has hundreds of people to create terrain for them. Even though the scope of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> is much smaller, it seems challenging. How’d you do it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I made a lot of mistakes along the way, haha. But in the end, we focused on adding a lot of density and verticality to the map. Even if the player has explored everything at street level, there’s still more to find when they look behind fences or climb a terrace. We also took inspiration from metroidvanias and created areas that were clearly exploreable but players wouldn’t be able to reach until they had progressed further in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I found the cat’s animation to be very well-observed, and it abounds in little details, like how their ears fold back when running, or how they squeeze through low passages. I’ve also noticed that they control kind of like a train: they have a front and back half that are connected, and the caboose follows the engine, so to speak. I don’t know how accurate this observation is, but I thought it was interesting that they seemed to control this way. Are there any insights you can offer for kitty animation?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We watched a LOT of cat videos. Truly so much credit goes to Micah Breitweiser, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/deep-dive-how-little-kitty-big-city-rejects-realism-to-achieve-authenticity">who added a lot of those small details to our characters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">! She has an amazing understanding of both how cats communicate through body language and how to translate those movements into animation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the movement and a few other things are a combination of hand made animation and dynamic real time bone movement in the game. Cats move in smooth curves, and it was difficult to get that and have it work dynamically in all situations, so I decided the procedural combo was the best solution.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World navigation was for the most part simple and intuitive: you hold the jump button down, and the game displays its arc and destination, which can then be adjusted. I don’t know if other games have done this before, but I think it’s a key aspect of the play: controlling the kitty could have been so much more difficult without it. Did you plan to have the cat control that way from the start?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The arc jump or what I call “the precision jump” was implemented very early on, but it was much simpler than what we shipped with. I wanted the game to feel relaxed, so taking the time to line up every jump seemed like a good idea. But once I implemented the first version and had people play it, it was painfully slow, and players begged for a faster way to jump around. So I implemented the quick version of that, which under the hood is almost exactly the same jump, it just does all of the targeting invisibly for you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't know if any other games that do this either. It was just a thing that seemed to make sense to me, imagining a cat ready to pounce and then springing to their destination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Progress is gated by finding fish, which can be thought of as a tasty version of the Shrine Orbs in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> that increase stamina. In the </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> games they’re much more helpful than necessary, but </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> seems like it was designed so that all the fish are needed. Do you think a speedrunner will find a way to bust the design wide open?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Oh absolutely. The speedrunners have already beat the game sub 30 seconds with no fish. It's crazy! Technically, without using advanced strats or glitching, you can make it home with just three fish. Originally I was going to let you get home with just one and have the other fish more for doing side quests, but we really wanted most people to experience the joy of stealing a fish from someone.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>&nbsp;Finally, I support the decision completely, but why is the game set in a Japanese city in particular? Does it just seem like a good place for a kitty to explore?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The first time I visited Japan, I kind of fell in love with the cities and towns. I also have this problem where I can't convince myself to deep dive into a topic unless I can also convince myself it's “useful” in some way (it's a curse). So since I really wanted to research and explore Japanese-style urban design, it became the perfect excuse to set the game in Japan, haha. That's only partly the reason of course. I also have a strong association in my mind between cats and Tokyo streets. That and being fans of Japanese cat media like Chi’s Sweet Home, Cat Beginner and a manga from the '80s called What’s Michael, it just made sense.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-roOCTB7ok">The game was revealed last year</a>, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's <a href="https://bigmode.com/games/star-of-providence">website</a>, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="331" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Two years after its debut, FromSoftware’s latest<em> Elden Ring </em>patch makes one of its most infuriating encounters a bit easier. Said boss always made a brilliant first impression, then quickly fumbles its introduction with a nasty second phase that has players hoofin’ it — quite literally, after today’s update. </p> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="93" data-injectable="false"><strong>Spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn’t experienced <em>Elden Ring’s </em>base-game content. </strong></p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true"><em>Elden Ring’s</em> final boss, Radagon of the Golden Order, is an incredible fight. The score swells, the one-on-one combat shines, and the spectacle of his attacks dazzle. Then, a second phase comes along and sours the whole affair: the Elden Beast. Well, starting today, that wet blanket of a fight is going to be a lot more bearable as the Tarnished’s trusty companion rushes to the rescue. </p>
 <h2 id="h-torrent-dashes-into-the-elden-beast-arena" data-injectable="false">Torrent dashes into the Elden Beast arena</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bandai Namco YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Torrent, the spectral steed who carried us all across the Lands Between, can now be summoned to help players fight the Elden Beast as of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today’s pre-DLC patch. </a> Why is this important? Well, mostly because the entire Elden Beast fight <em>seems</em> to have been designed with Torrent in mind from the start.</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">The Elden Beast loves, and I mean just <em>adores</em> wasting the player’s time by flying the length of the arena away every four to five seconds. Prior to today’s patch, you spent most of this encounter simply running after the thing, dodging its merciless ranged attacks before reaching it, doing one or two hits of damage, and repeating the process. Not anymore. </p> <h2 id="h-hitless-runs-got-easier-too" data-injectable="false">Hitless runs got easier, too</h2> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="false">Further helped by this addition is “hitless” runs: self-imposed challenges where players attempt the entire game without taking so much as a papercut’s worth of damage. Elden Stars, an attack used by the boss, features aggressive homing missiles that are nearly impossible for a player to dodge on foot. The hope is with the addition of Torrent, this attack that cut runs down mere inches from the finish line will be much more reliably avoided. </p>

<p data-characters="112" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">EA gave players a first look at new features coming to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/madden-25-2024-release-window-platforms-and-more/">Madden 25</a></em>, including what to expect from Superstar mode. </p> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">EA confirmed that players can transition their Road to Glory character from <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> into <em>Madden 25</em> Superstar mode. It’s been 10 years since players could use this feature in <em>NCAA College Football 14 </em>before the series went on a lengthy hiatus. The ability to pay athletes opened the door for EA to revive the franchise, and now football fans will have the exciting opportunity to take a created avatar through all four years of college and then under the bright lights of the NFL. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="832" data-injectable="true">If players want to take advantage of the transition feature, the $150 MVP bundle includes Deluxe Editions of <em>Madden 25</em> and <em>College Football 25</em>. In comparison, purchasing the Deluxe Editions separately costs $200, so if you already planned on getting both titles, you can save $50. <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> launches on July 19, while Madden 25 hits shelves on August 16. This gives players just under a month to get a head start on their Road to Glory Journey, which should be plenty of time to knock out a few college seasons. </p>
 <p data-characters="633" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><em>Madden 25</em> Superstar mode features new NFL Draft Combine drills so players can show off their EA Sports College Football 25 avatar’s skills and improve their draft stock. Based on your avatar’s Combine performance and college career stats, they will be drafted by an NFL team between the first and seventh rounds. EA also implemented a new Superstar quest system that challenges players to improve their relationship with the media, coach, and teammates. In addition, there are new upgrades to Player Grading that revamp player progression and make the transition from being a rookie to a seasoned veteran more realistic. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Madden 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-5zgzEAeAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="172" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false">As for what players can expect from <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, the development team plans on revealing more information about the game mode closer to the release date. </p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Grimdark fantasy sounds like a pretty niche genre until you take a little look behind its musty curtain to see all the books and incredibly dark worlds lurking there. While many of the places in this genre feel impossibly bleak, the stories you’ll read are often far from it.</p> <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">I always thought grimdark fantasy was restricted to the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40K</a></em> universe, but there’s so much more to it than the <em>Black Library</em>. High fantasy and low fantasy settings can each easily slot into the genre, and you’d be surprised by what you’ve already read that’s considered part of it. If the world is harsh and the people in it have very little joy or things to look forward to, you’re reading grimdark fantasy, but the stories can give you hope and help you see there’s always a silver lining if you fight on.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-grimdark-fantasy-books-to-check-out-this-year" data-injectable="false">The best grimdark fantasy books to check out this year</h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Below, I’ve listed the best grimdark fantasy books you should read this year. It feels like the genre is gaining more of a presence as new TV shows adapt books from it or certain franchises grow in popularity across social media platforms. If you want to get into grimdark fantasy this year, these are the books I recommend you dive into. </p> <h3 id="h-15-a-game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/DGQuBEY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">15. A Game of Thrones: George R. R. Martin</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/DGQuBEY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Game of Thrones</a></em> is the first book in George R. R. Martin’s<em> A Song of Ice and Fire</em> epic. It introduces you to a bleak continent upon which everyone has experienced years of prosperous summer, but winter is coming. It follows several major and minor characters as a family is split up after an ominous sign leads to betrayal and the revelation that while dark forces are working in the world to bring it to its knees, even among the people, darkness is attempting to pull the kingdom down. </p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">This book is a fantastic opener to a series that spans a world with a grimdark history and sets up the epic stories that follow. From the princess of a dying house being sold as a bride to a lord being forced to question everything he knows about his best friend as he enters the royal court and finds that everyone is out for themselves, it’s worth reading for the scene about bending the knee at the very least, and that’s all I’ll leave you with. </p>

The story opens years into a series of wars that see an empire attempting to conquer an entire continent. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">The main plot is gripping and explores just how dark this empire can be, even for those who are loyal to it. Even its subplot, which looks at this world’s gods and how they meddle with the world, is fascinating. It feels like a nice mix of folk tales from around the world and fantasy tropes, creating something unique and intriguing. </p> <h3 id="h-13-sharp-ends-joe-abercrombie" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/v9asd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">13.

 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/v9asd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sharp Ends</a></em> is a collection of short stories set in Joe Abercrombie’s world of <em>First Law</em>. While the main trilogy itself is a brilliant set of grimdark fantasy books to delve into, these short stories are easily digestible in small chunks, perfect for commutes or reading one per night if you want to experience self-contained grimdark stories. If you enjoy these stories, there’s so much more to explore. They’re a wonderful entry point to a world of despair. </p>

It’s told from the point of a ship’s perspective in a world where all the darkest parts of pirate tales are completely normal, making most characters fairly evil on a base level. However, as you get to know them and follow the two main characters on their journey to fight a common threat, goodness emerges, and the characters develop into something more than when you first met them. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">It’s a story that should be familiar. The empire of this world is raising it to the ground in the name of unity and wants to eradicate piracy in the most brutal way possible. Pirates, of course, hate this idea. So they band together to fight against something that’s managed to be somehow even worse than they are. </p> <h3 id="h-11-the-fifth-season-n-k-jemisin" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ZnyPY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">11.

As if that weren’t enough, someone has torn a giant red scar into the Earth, spewing out fire and gases, blotting out the sun. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true">Essun, the protagonist, now needs to navigate this grimdark world alone and scared. I think it’s a great way to present a high fantasy world that’s just been torn apart, treating an active grimdark fantasy world that might get better but is likely only to get worse. It’s rare to see fantasy explore post-apocalyptic themes like this, making it a nice crossover if you’ve been reading a lot of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-thriller-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi</a>. </p>

 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">While the story is quite self-contained here, the world in which it’s set serves to only make things feel even more grimdark. Magic power in this world is finite, and every nation is battling for control over it.

Suddenly, life just got a lot more interesting. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I really enjoy grimdark stories that are set in impossible situations like these. The empire stamps down on anyone who might even think about opposing it, yet here we have a relic that could overthrow it with ease. the only trouble is going to be using it and staying alive long enough to do so. Thankfully, such a regime breeds a colossal underground network of thieves. </p> <h3 id="h-7-the-mad-trinkets-cameron-scott-kirk" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/HG55wO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">7.

Then, and only then, can they kill the occult-obsessed king who mercilessly murdered the young girl’s father. </p>
 <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">I don’t know if there’s anything more classically grimdark than occult relics. After all, magic is common enough in most fantasy books, so it would make sense that dark magic is just as common. Even if we don’t see it. Experiencing the problems that come with playing with these dark relics isn’t something we get to explore all too often, and the way the story remains dark regardless of the outcome makes it feel somehow hopeless regardless of who wins. </p>

People are sold into slavery to work mines deep below the surface, and this is where we meet Wynn, who has been sold into such a fate and will die unless they meet their quota. As if that wasn’t bad enough, a failed ritual has stirred up a darkness that must now be fought with a light that was extinguished so long ago that no one can remember what it even felt like. </p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">I adore explorations of humanity without faith in these dire situations.

It’s a simple story of revenge that sets up a saga you’ll want to see all the way through. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">If you love cowboys, pistols at dawn, but also zombies and a world that’s so far gone it’s basically dust, then this is a great book to explore.

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warframe’s</em> Jade Shadows update has primarily centered around some of the new weapons you can acquire from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-ascension-mission-type-in-warframe/">Ascension activity</a>. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">The Evensong, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-cantare-warframe-jade-shadows/">Cantare</a>, and Harmony all seem like interesting weapons that should prove valuable in the right hands. However, one other weapon has come back from the dead thanks to its focus in the Jade Shadows quest alongside a new skin. Here’s the best build for the Hate in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h3 id="h-the-best-mods-for-the-hate-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods for the Hate in Warframe</h3> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Ah, the Hate. This weapon has been in <em>Warframe</em> for over a decade now, and while it’s the infamous melee weapon of the Stalker, it’s not a weapon that’s talked about much. This is despite it being a rather strong and easy-to-get scythe, even sporting an <strong>Incarnon Genesis form</strong> if you’ve reached the late game. Its strengths lie in its Normal Attack, so we’re looking to build around that including an intriguing pivot. Here’s the mods you should run:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>Reaping Spiral (Stance)</li> <li>Discipline’s Merit (Aura)</li> <li>Condition Overload</li> <li>Organ Shatter</li> <li>Weeping Wounds</li> <li>Blood Rush</li> <li>Primed Reach</li> <li>Primed Smite for current enemy (Corrupted, Grineer, Corpus, etc.)</li> <li>Berserker Fury</li> <li>Gladiator Might</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true"><strong>Berserker Fury</strong> is the crux of this build, granting major attack speed after just two melee kills. Many of these other mods simply improve upon that with additional damage, Status Chance, and Range. The Discipline’s Merit is the wildcard here. While Heavy Attacks aren’t its strongest suit, having Tennokai proc can make it well worth the lost mod slot. As always, you can swap either Primed mod for their regular variant if you don’t have it. You can also swap the Smite mod for additional attack speed through Fury if you wish.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-arcane-for-the-hate" data-injectable="false">What’s the best Arcane for the Hate?</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">By far, your best Arcane is going to be<strong> Melee Animosity</strong>. Thanks to the use of Tennokai incentivizing Heavy Attacks, having standard melee attacks grant Crit Chance will help ensure each Tennokai proc does huge amounts of damage. If that isn’t your style, Melee Duplicate is a decent alternative for that extra attack.</p>

<p data-characters="156" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s common knowledge that FromSoftware’s Souls series and its children — <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> — are some of the best games ever made. </p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">What not everyone knows, however, is that many of these games’ DLCs often provide even better gameplay experiences than the original games. Let’s rank the best DLCs in the history of the series so far.</p> <figure data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-dark-souls-2-crown-of-the-ivory-king" data-injectable="false">8. Dark Souls 2: Crown Of The Ivory King</h2> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Whether or not you like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sorry-haters-dark-souls-2-was-instrumental-in-the-creation-of-elden-ring/">maligned <em>Dark Souls 2</em></a>, one thing I recommend you don’t sleep on are its DLCs. They each provide a better gameplay experience than the base game. While I’m not crazy about the Ivory King DLC, I must give it credit for a few bold choices. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">This is the first time in the series that players have to deal not only with very wide-open areas, but also with weather effects that will greatly impair the player’s vision. Ivory King ensures that brave knight will become truly errant in their quest of finding the next <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-soulsborne-hub-areas-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy checkpoint</a>. I wouldn’t want to play a whole game where I can’t see crap most of the time, but I find this detour an interesting change for a DLC-sized adventure.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel" data-injectable="false">7. Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel</h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">I was originally pretty disappointed with <em>Dark Souls 3</em>‘s first DLC because I had learned it only featured two bosses even before I got to play it. It’s an all-time low when it comes to boss amount for a <em>Souls</em> DLC, and things get even worse when you enter the first fight and it’s just… not very memorable. </p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">I didn’t care for the first boss, and I <em>really </em>didn’t care for the ice-covered and insect-filled areas, but the final boss more than made up for it. Sister Friede is fast, has a bunch of nasty tricks up her sleeve that I won’t spoil here, and her fight is split into <strong>three</strong> wildly different forms. Turns out <em>From</em> wasn’t getting cheap when it came to bosses — they were just banding them together to maximize the amount of headaches they could cause!</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-6-dark-souls-2-crown-of-the-sunken-king" data-injectable="false">6. Dark Souls 2: Crown Of The Sunken King</h2> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">One of the weakest aspects of the original <em>Dark Souls</em> <em>2</em> is its level design. <em>Sunken King</em> feels like an apology letter to that. It invites players to an intricate system of underground pyramids where you can waste a lot of time just taking neat screenshots. </p>
 <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">It’s not exactly spectacular when it comes to the number of bosses, but it does feature three very different boss encounters which are pretty decent in their own right.</p> <figure data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-dark-souls-2-crown-of-the-old-iron-king" data-injectable="false">5. Dark Souls 2: Crown Of The Old Iron King</h2> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">This is an absolute slap on the face of all <em>Dark Souls 2</em> haters that just cannot dodge or deflect. The <em>Old Iron King</em> DLC features good level design, absolutely gorgeous looks, and two of the best bosses in the entire series. Yes, this is the one with the Fume Knight, the only boss in <em>DS2</em> that falls in the much-derided category of being “just a guy in armor” that’s actually incredibly challenging and fun to do battle against.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">This is the DLC you should recommend to anyone saying that <em>Dark Souls 2</em> isn’t deserving of its name. It’s cheating because it’s not the base game, sure, but please bear in mind that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-reveals-the-pendants-true-purpose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miyazaki would probably be so proud of your mischief.</a></p> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>

Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City</h2> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">There’s not a single DLC in <em>Souls</em> history that’s even a hair below “pretty damn good”. Still, they rarely try to convey a different feel than the one you get from their main game. <em>The Ringed City</em> is the end of <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, and every moment of it seems like it’s carrying a bittersweet feeling of finality. Every boss is incredibly tough to kill, the arenas and play areas are as grand and majestic as they’ve ever been, and there’s not a single victory that doesn’t come paired with an immense sense of achievement. </p>
 <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false">Finally beating the last boss of <em>Dark Souls</em> <em>3</em> felt like killing a dragon IRL — even if the final boss isn’t a dragon, but actually just some old guy.</p> <figure data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-dark-souls-artorias-of-the-abyss" data-injectable="false">3. Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss</h2> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Dark Souls</em> only featured one DLC, but it was one for the ages. FromSoft was very FromSoft-like when they put Artorias, the <em>Dark Souls-ified</em> version of King Arthur, in the game’s cover, but not in the base game. </p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">Players were seriously hyped to see if the legendary knight who’d fought the abyss was as cool as promised — and as pissed off as you’d expect for someone who had his dog murdered by a mysterious knight. The answer was yes to both. Artorias provides such a cool challenge that he could be the only boss in that DLC and still make it work, but it features three more bosses, all pretty memorable in their own right.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-bloodborne-the-old-hunters" data-injectable="false">2. Bloodborne: The Old Hunters</h2> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>Bloodborne</em> only has one DLC, but don’t let that fool you into believing you will not get to quench your thirst for the finest old blood in the entirety of the cosmos. </p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"><em>Bloodborne’s The Old Hunters</em> is one of the best DLCs in FromSoft’s history because it’s not one, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodbornes-two-dlc-packs-have-been-combined-in-the-substantial-the-old-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two of the best DLCs</a> ever made merged into one. Yes, it turns out that From had originally intended <em>Bloodborne</em> to have two DLCs, but they ended up being nice to the point of just cramming <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-the-bloodborne-dlc-bosses/">all the best</a></strong> bosses of <em>Bloodborne</em> into one single package. The result? The best challenge that you could ever hope to get for such a low price.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree" data-injectable="false">1. Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">You’d be hard-pressed to convince me that <em>Elden Ring </em>isn’t an all-timer in the realm of video games. The open-world <em>Souls</em>-style game took the world by storm in 2022, and it’s become an instant hallmark of FromSoftware’s library.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="false">I understand fearing that this DLC would disappoint, because even “great” pales in comparison to what <em>Elden Ring</em> is. The good news is that it’s a fantastic mix of new and (revamped) old, one that rules even though the developers lied to us. Yeah, Hidetaka Miyazaki said that the playable space in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a></em> would cover an area more or less the size of Limgrave, but the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bigger-than-most-full-games-hidetaka-miyazaki-mustve-been-pulling-our-legs-when-he-said-its-map-was-comparable-to-the-size-of-limgrave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Realm Of Shadow is so much vaster</a> and has so much more to do. Perhaps it shouldn’t be battling it out with DLC, but with full-priced games.</p>

		<p>Focus and developer Saber Interactive have shared a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> gameplay overview trailer, showing off the chunky third person action and chitinous Tyranid enemies. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is coming out on 9th September 2024 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 sees the Ultramarines and Captain Demetrian Titus (now demoted to Lieutenant after the original game) stepping into the breach to face off against the Tyranid hordes invading the Imperial worlds of Avarax and Kadaku. While he might have been demoted, Titus has undergone the Rubicon Primaris process to transform him into a taller, stronger and faster Primaris Space Marine – a relatively new narrative twist in the 42nd millenium, after the return of the Primarchs.</p>
<p>Fighting alongside Titus are Brother-Sergeant Gadriel and Brother Chairon. This trio can all be player controlled, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/see-the-first-co-op-campaign-gameplay-from-space-marine-2/">Space Marine 2 features three-player campaign co-op</a>.</p>
<p>This new overview also delved into the PvE Operations and PvP Eternal War modes &nbsp;these both feature six playable classes – Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy – and lean in on a customisation system for your own Space Marine. It’s not just cosmetics, but will let you level up your weapons through play with a shared progression system. After launch, Saber will roll out content updates to add more Operations missions, PvP maps, weapons and more</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-the-sequel-you-never-expected/">Space Marine 2 was revealed in 2021</a>, and is in development at Saber Interactive who are best known for World War Z and Snowrunner. The horde element from World War Z definitely plays a part in Space Marine 2, able to show off the mass of angry aliens that the Tyranid are known for – certainly, we’re going to have much grander action than was possible in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/09/12/review-warhammer-40000-space-marine/">the 2011 original</a>.</p>
<p>Dom got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preview-better-the-boltgun-you-know/">hands on with Space Marine 2 back at Gamescom</a>, writing “Combat in Space Marine 2 is unapologetically gritty, focussing on the risk and reward of executions to renew your ability bank. Blood flies out of everywhere, which is little surprise when the Space Marines are packing swords with chainsaws built in and boltguns with ammo the size of your fist. There’s a cool parry move to utilise, and you have to mix up your approaches as you deal with ever-larger Tyranid enemies. They behave as you’d expect, like a flood of alien locusts that swarm towards you, intent on turning you to mulch. Better you do it to them first, then!”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/otherskin-is-a-new-third-person-shooter-with-strong-ps2-vibes.906756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/otherskin-ps2-style-shooter-q4-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher FDG Entertainment and developer Game Atelier have announced&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>, a third-person shooter-platformer hybrid that has more than a hint of the PS2 era about it.</p>
<p>Game Atelier, whose name you might recognize from&nbsp;<em>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom</em>, describes&nbsp;<em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>as a "fast-paced third-person sci-fi platforming action-adventure", which sure is a lot of genre names.</p>
<p>By the looks of the gameplay footage released alongside the game's reveal, it's taking cues from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/returnal-review"><em>Returnal</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/scars-above-review">Scars Above</a>&nbsp;</em>(although hopefully it turns out to be a little more successful than the latter).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/otherskin-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=MnUieJZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/otherskin-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=y8LcCrbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>blends third-person shooting and platforming for a throwback PS2 vibe.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>will take you to Planet Vandermire, a world falling prey to a threat known only as the Corruption. Hey, I think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creatures-of-ava-release-date"><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>would like a word</a>,&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava</em>, though, it looks like the Corruption is turning alien life hostile on Vandermire, and it's up to Alex to fight her way through the planet in order to learn what she can about the deadly threat.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll blast your way through a number of different enemies, and you'll be able to absorb "morphs" that will grant you new powers to help you explore your environment more effectively.</p>
<p>You can check out the cinematic reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>, which sets up the game's story and the world of Vandermire, right here.</p>

<p>The game will feature both ranged and melee combat, and Game Atelier says it'll be "a breeze" to swap between the two modes depending on the situation.</p>
<p>While a gameplay trailer hasn't been uploaded yet,&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622630/Otherskin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> does feature some gameplay footage, and if you're a fan of PS2-era shooters like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025"><em>Metroid Prime</em></a>, it looks like you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>
<p><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC in the fourth quarter of 2024. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

  <p id="oMj2e7">September is not too far away, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22821314/batman-penguin-colin-farrell-spinoff-hbo-max"><em>The Penguin</em></a>, Max’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22951429/the-batman-movie-review-2022"><em>The Batman</em></a><em> </em>spinoff TV series, seems to know it. A new trailer for the show gets right down to it in a way that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680583/penguin-trailer-teaser-colin-farrell-dc-studios-batman">previous teases avoided</a>: This is a cutthroat mafia succession story set in the dark and oily Gotham City showcased in Matt Reeves’ Robert Pattinson-led 2022 film. </p>
<p id="KB3PBX"><em>The Batman</em> star Colin Farrell now has a whole cast to strive against in his quest to fill the power vacuum following the death of boss Carmine “The Roman” Falcone — and it’s a who’s who of Gotham City mafia figures from the most influential mafia-focused Batman books. Clancy Brown plays Salvatore Maroni, the guy who threw acid in Harvey Dent’s face; Michael Kelly plays Johnny Vitti, Falcone’s nephew and enforcer introduced in <em>Batman: Year One</em>; and Michael Zegen plays Alberto Falcone, a major player in <em>Batman: The Long Halloween</em>. Finally, Cristin Milioti plays a woman who appears to be Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot’s biggest rival for power, Sophia “Gigante” Falcone, the daughter of The Roman. </p>
<p id="xETvDI">We’ll see who comes out on top — and whether Batman has anything to say about it — when <em>The Penguin</em> premieres on the Max streaming service in September</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24181309/kinds-of-kindness-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181309/kinds-of-kindness-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="OkQqQ2">What happens to auteur theory when a film director appears to be two markedly different auteurs at the same time? If you were working on a unified theory of surrealist director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24006971/poor-things-yorgos-lanthimos-interview-emma-stone">Yorgos Lanthimos</a> that established a continuum between his early works in Greece, his English-language breakthroughs <em>The Lobster</em> and <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>, and his period Oscar contenders <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/24/18236661/the-favourite-story-ending"><em>The Favourite</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093718/poor-things-hulu-oscars-book-differences"><em>Poor Things</em></a>, get ready to scrap it. Lanthimos’ new movie, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>, arriving just six months after <em>Poor Things</em>, is a hard left turn — or perhaps a jump into a parallel universe that establishes two distinct tracks to the director’s career.</p>
<p id="v2LYXJ">It’s like <em>The Favourite </em>and <em>Poor Things</em> never happened. Those films’ rococo look, stylistic flamboyance, and broad, almost ribald humor is nowhere to be found. Neither is the archness and melodrama of Australian screenwriter Tony McNamara, who worked on both. Instead, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> stages unsettling, abstract moral fables in a starkly photographed modern world. The humor is underplayed, mordant, and pitch-black. It’s instantly recognizable as the work of that other Lanthimos, the one who made <em>Dogtooth</em>, <em>The Lobster</em>, and the darkly menacing <em>Sacred Deer</em>. Unsurprisingly, it reunites Lanthimos with his co-screenwriter on those films, Efthimis Filippou.</p>
<p id="RbiVfQ">Maybe Lanthimos is aware of this bifurcation in his work: It seems like split identities are on his mind. <em>Kinds of Kindness </em>is actually an anthology of three shortish films, with a total run time of 164 minutes. Each of the three uses the same troupe of core actors: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134902/civil-war-jesse-plemons-bodies-scene">Jesse Plemons</a>, Emma Stone, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2019/2/12/18216887/willem-dafoe-at-eternitys-gate-interview-oscars">Willem Dafoe</a>, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, and Mamoudou Athie. The same faces keep coming back as different people. And within each of the three stories, characters contend with identities that have been broken in two, that they don’t seem to have control over, or that are unreliable in other ways.</p>

</p>
<p id="w6vBrA">In the first film, “The Death of R.M.F.,” Plemons plays Robert, a businessman who has allowed his powerful boss, Raymond (Dafoe), to take over every aspect of his life, detailing precisely what he eats and when he has sex with his wife (Chau). After failing to hospitalize himself via a car accident per Raymond’s orders, Robert tries to break free of his boss’s control. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn.</p>
<p id="1j4SMO">The second segment, “R.M.F. Is Flying,” focuses on Plemons again, this time as Daniel, a police officer whose wife, Liz (Stone), a marine biologist, has gone missing on a research expedition. When Liz returns, Daniel becomes obsessed with the idea that she’s an impostor. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn. (This segment bears a striking resemblance to Julia Armfield’s excellent 2022 novel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58659343-our-wives-under-the-sea"><em>Our Wives Under the Sea</em></a>.)</p>
<p id="RdTozQ">The third episode, “R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,” casts Stone and Plemons as Emily and Andrew, cultists trying to track down a prophesied woman with the power of resurrection. The woman is central to the beliefs of Andrew and Emily’s bizarre, water-obsessed cult, led by Omi (Dafoe) and Aka (Chau). On the mission, Emily secretly and hesitantly reconnects with her husband (Alwyn) and young daughter, exposing herself to her previous, pre-cult life. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn.</p>

<p id="xvE6q1">None of these people are R.M.F., by the way. R.M.F. are the initials of an incidental but significant character in all three stories who, in the movie’s funniest meta joke, bears a passing resemblance to Lanthimos himself. R.M.F. is played by Yorgos Stefanakos, who, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10606356/#didYouKnow">according to the IMDb</a>, is a notary from Athens and an old friend of Lanthimos and Filippou.</p>
<p id="bQc4Sk">If you’ve seen any of Lanthimos’ pre-<em>Favourite</em> movies, particularly <em>The Lobster</em> or <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>, you’ll have a sense for what to expect from <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>. But Lanthimos newbies coming straight from <em>Poor Things</em> and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24046867/oscars-2024-nominations-list-predictions-movies">11 Oscar nominations</a> may be in for a shock. The flavor of surrealism Lanthimos employs here is very different. Each story takes a somewhat recognizable situation from modern, middle-class life and puts a twist on it that is absurd, symbolic, or terrifying — and frequently all three. The performances are deliberately stilted, and the characters’ behavior is inexplicably weird, but somehow painfully relatable at the same time. Where David Lynch’s movies, for example, tap into the unnerving illogic of dreams, Lanthimos — this version of him, anyway — takes slightly cruel delight in making the emotional realities of waking life as upsetting and unnerving as nightmares.</p>
<p id="GSpfn8">In this, he gets a lot of help from composer Jerskin Fendrix and cinematographer Robbie Ryan, who both rolled straight into <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> from <em>Poor Things</em>. For my money, Fendrix’s discomfiting plinky-plonk musical sketches work much better in this alienated modern world than they did in <em>Poor Things</em>’ Victorian fantasia. Ryan, meanwhile, turns in radically different work for this project. Where <em>Poor Things </em>was saturated in lush, artificial lighting and distorted fish-eye-lens frames, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> is shot with the geometrical, roomy austerity of a Stanley Kubrick movie.</p>

<p id="XLg4Q6">The movie was filmed in and around New Orleans, and it gets fantastic mileage from its locations, conjuring a distinctive mood for each segment: sleek, luxurious modernism in “The Death of R.M.F.,” becalmed suburbia in “R.M.F Is Flying,” and seedy edgelands in “R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich.” Lanthimos, Ryan, and the costume and production design teams keep coming up with cool, arresting images: Stone peeling out of a motel car park in a purple Dodge Challenger; Dafoe and Chao bending over to cry single tears into a paddling pool; Dafoe strutting his stuff in dress shorts and high socks; Plemons tenderly stroking the face of a bum in a police station.</p>
<p id="LRaKwn">Even within the constraints of Lanthimos’ underplayed style, a movie like this is a treat for the actors, and Plemons’ transformation is particularly extraordinary: not just his bearing, but his whole body type seems to shift from piece to piece. You could call this movie <em>The Plemons Variations</em>. Stone’s agonizingly brittle performance as Emily dominates the third segment, although Dafoe and Chao are hilariously convincing as smug cult leaders. Lanthimos’ sensibility is an ideal match for the warped tranquility of a modern cult, and this third segment might be the most enjoyably weird window to peek into in <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>.</p>
<p id="JAI67W">It’s not the tidiest of the stories, though, and by the point it arrives, viewers have already been immersed in Lanthimos’ uncomfortable world for a long time. All three stories sit somewhere between short-form and long-form storytelling, and all three unfold at an unhurried pace. It’s a long sit, which may be part of the reason why the first story, “The Death of R.M.F.,” feels the most gripping and incisive. It will be interesting to try watching the three separately, like a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24146275/best-limited-series-mini-tv-shows-watch-streaming">miniseries</a>, when the movie is available at home; I can also imagine them expanded into individual 80- or 90-minute movies, as <em>Planet Terror</em> and <em>Death Proof </em>were after the release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s 2007 pulp anthology <em>Grindhouse</em>.</p>
<p id="JCeSuZ">But watching them in isolation means missing the subtle but fascinating echoes between them, and the cumulative effect of piecing together the fragmented performances of the film’s brilliant cast. <em>Poor Things</em> is ultimately a hopeful journey for a deconstructed person, Stone’s Bella Baxter, who’s working to make herself whole. <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> returns us to the Lanthimos who — cruelly, but with tenderness and wry humor — prefers to pick people apart, open them up, and lay them out on the slab.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="v2OFcV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147524/mars-express-movie-review-sci-fi-french-animation"><em>Mars Express</em></a>, the new sci-fi noir thriller from French director and animator Jérémie Périn, is finally available to stream on VOD this week following its American theatrical run in May. Périn’s film is fantastic: a sophisticated, hard-boiled detective story set in a futuristic society where humans and robots live side by side that’s as indebted to <em>Chinatown</em> and <em>The Long Goodbye</em> as it is to <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p id="Vu3wa5">Polygon recently had a chance to connect with Périn, so we had to ask: <strong>What was your first favorite anime, and what’s your favorite anime now?</strong></p>
<p id="OEJsgv">My Favorite Anime is Polygon’s column dedicated to collecting the stories of the biggest celebrity anime fans in the world, charting a path from their earliest introductions to Japanese animation to the series and films they love today. Here’s what Jérémie Périn had to say.</p>
<hr id="ngW9fx">
<h2 id="q7lPNH"><strong>What was your first favorite anime?</strong></h2>

<p id="urWMx6">Based on the manga by Buichi Terasawa, <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> is a 1982 sci-fi adventure anime about a bored office worker who accidentally discovers that he’s a swashbuckling mercenary who erased his own memories in order to elude a deadly group of space pirates. After regaining his memories, Cobra resumes his life as a mercenary, embarking on adventures around the universe with his partner, Lady Armaroid.</p>
<div id="3NchBy"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pw6H9doABWY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zdwRMf">While Terasawa cited <em>Star Trek</em>, the James Bond film series, and the animation of René Laloux as his inspirations while writing the manga, the premise of <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> also bears a striking resemblance to Philip K. Dick’s 1966 short story “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,” later adapted by Paul Verhoeven as <em>Total Recall</em>.</p>
<p id="gRrOK9">The other anime Périn cited, <em>The Rose of Versailles</em>,<em> </em>is a historical drama that takes place  before and during the French Revolution and follows the story of Oscar François de Jarjayes, the youngest daughter of a military general who raises her like a son so that she will one day succeed him as commander of the royal guard at the Palace of Versailles. Distraught over the plight of the French public under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien_r%C3%A9gime"><em>ancien régime</em></a>, Oscar eventually leaves the guard to fight alongside the revolutionaries with her lover, André.</p>
<div id="FAjLFO"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJIeJIqw-J0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="cr14WM">While on the surface these two anime couldn’t appear further apart, they actually share one remarkable thing in common. Both <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> and <em>The Rose of Versailles</em> were directed by Osamu Dezaki, the anime legend who directed the 1970 anime adaptation of <em>Ashita no Joe</em> and co-founded the Japanese animation studio Madhouse. Dezaki is considered one of the most influential anime directors of the ’70s and ’80s, known for his distinctive visual style that incorporated split-screen imagery, Dutch angle shots, and other techniques that were uncommon in anime at the time. He is also best known for his use of pastel freeze frames, called “postcard memories,” which have since become a foundational visual trope throughout the entire medium of modern anime. </p>
<h2 id="Rr5DO3"><strong>What’s your favorite anime now?</strong></h2>

<p id="IhHuvc">Directed by Mamoru Oshii and produced by Production I.G, <em>Patlabor 2: The Movie</em> is a 1993 sci-fi political thriller set in an alternate 2002 where “Labors,” large-scale robots designed for heavy construction work, have revolutionized Japan’s economy. To respond to the increase in Labor-related crime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police forms a special crime unit that deploys their own Patrol Labors (“Patlabors”) to resolve these cases.</p>
<div id="cN0StD"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enwTApkJ0cc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="f69A0Z">Unlike previous anime in the Patlabor franchise, <em>Patlabor 2: The Movie</em> is not a police comedy, but instead an explicitly political film that touches heavily on domestic and international issues Japan was facing at the time it was produced, such as the debate over Japan’s postwar identity and the deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Cambodia. The plot concerns the members of the Special Vehicles Unit of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department who work to apprehend the leader of a terrorist cell conspiring to incite havoc under the pretense of a coup.</p>
<p id="zxz3oQ">With a budget over twice that of the first Patlabor movie and <a href="https://animetudes.com/2022/04/22/mobile-police-patlabor-2-the-movie/">an improved layout production system</a> that saw talented animators and artists like Masahiro Ando, Satoshi Kon, and Hiroyuki Okiura working under animation director Kazuchika Kise, <em>Patlabor 2</em> was lauded for its more sophisticated photorealistic animation style, a style which would later be iterated upon in Oshii’s next film: the 1995 cyberpunk action anime <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p id="08E9oK"><em>Patlabor 2</em> is considered one of the best anime movies of the ’90s. Unfortunately, it’s currently unavailable to stream online. However, the film is included, along with the entire Patlabor series, in the Patlabor: The Mobile Police Ultimate Collection Blu-ray set available through the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.crunchyroll.com%2Fproducts%2Fpatlabor-special-edition-blu-ray-816726027234.html&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fanime%2F2024%2F6%2F20%2F24180862%2Fmy-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23944903__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://store.crunchyroll.com/products/patlabor-special-edition-blu-ray-816726027234.html\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23944903__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://store.crunchyroll.com/products/patlabor-special-edition-blu-ray-816726027234.html&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Crunchyroll Store</a> or <a href="https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/products/patlabor-the-mobile-police-ultimate-collection-blu-ray">Sentai Filmworks</a>.</p>

Many of the ones I saw within a few hours of the announcement poked fun at how Zelda<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/WendyDoodles/status/1803103467755675926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/WendyDoodles/status/1803103467755675926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> might use a table</a></span> or a chair in battle, akin to a professional wrestler.

I feel my own fervor for <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>being stoked with every bit of fanart or memes that I see folks posting online, so please keep it coming. This is the kind of energy I can get behind any day of the week. And <em>yes</em>, you’re all right, we should absolutely give Zelda a gun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s endlessly charming thanks to a great cast of characters and interesting missions, pulled together and kept interesting by engaging writing.

You are the first robot, or “robo” reporter aboard the <em>Times &amp; Galaxy,</em> and in a fun bit of customization, you can create your robo reporter from three body type presets and a wide-ranging color palette (I named my custom robo <em>Kotaku</em> Staff, obviously). Once aboard you’ll meet the staff of eccentric investigative reporters, sports journalists, art critics, and opinion writers. Before long, you are sent out on assignment<br></p><p>Assignments are the central gameplay loop of <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>. These are short adventures out on planets during which you must interview and investigate an area in hopes of writing the best story possible. When chatting with potential witnesses or sources you are offered dialogue options. Choose carefully, because you won’t always be able to ask every question, and whatever the interview subject says in response is all you have to work with. Assignments span all types of potential articles—the tutorial assignment is about a vehicle crash that may be hiding a corporate cover-up, but later assignments introduce you to court reporting, reviewing a restaurant, covering a cat show, and more. There are both exciting and boring assignments—as is the case in real journalism—but <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s sharp writing makes all of them fun thanks to a never-ending parade of weirdos to encounter.</p><figure id="" data-id="3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-recommend-id="image://3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-recommend-id="image://3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a satisfying challenge to each assignment as well: turn a boring story into a hit. That’s where the build-a-story feature comes in. As a robo reporter, your special software lets you piece together sections of an article based on the information you’ve gathered. Depending on how thoroughly you explored and interviewed, you will have more options available to you. At the end of an assignment, you get to choose the hed, lede, nutgraf, key quote, and any detail that may add to the story.<br></p><p>If you don’t know what these things mean, don’t worry—as a new robo reporter, <em>Times &amp; Galaxy </em>will give you a crash course in journalism basics—no silly master’s degree that costs way too much money required! Each option also has a point rating based on how it will raise or lower readership and reputation. With that information, you can boost the paper’s standing, or ruin it.</p><h2 id="h1293"><a id=""></a><strong>Office space</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-recommend-id="image://6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="687" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-recommend-id="image://6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="687" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When not out on assignment, you get to relax on the Scanner, the paper’s home base/spaceship. Time aboard the Scanner serves as a chance to get to know your coworkers. While they all have their own beat, each writer isn’t defined by their coverage. Learning about every hobby and interoffice spat makes talking to every person worth it. The continuous fighting between opinion writer Richard Gravity and Copybot (the robo copy editor) is one of my favorite side stories in the game. Though as much of an annoyance as Richard Gravity is, I cannot in good conscience side with the em-dash hating Copybot. Learning about and building relationships with—you can romance almost anyone on the Scanner—earns complimentary comparisons to time spent chatting with the beloved cast of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><em>Mass Effect</em></a></span> series while aboard the Normandy. That isn’t by accident: studio founder Ben Gelinas is an ex-Bioware writer who worked on <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and <em>Andromeda</em>.<br></p><p>As with <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s assignments, talking to everyone and exploring every corner of the Scanner is rewarded. While on assignment you are rewarded with better story options, aboard the Scanner you are rewarded with plain old character-building! </p><p>Writing dialogue and in-game text is where the developers at Copychaser Games flex their muscles the most, especially when it comes to satire. Jokes about newsrooms being short-staffed, not getting paid, em-dash arguments, endless PR emails, and more are so funny because they are so true to life. I might be biased since I am exactly this game’s audience but my fiancee—who ignores me as much as possible when I talk about my job—also loved the game’s comedic tone. That’s likely because in casting you as an intern<em> Times &amp; Galaxy </em>can teach you about journalism—even in a basic form—so that you can then laugh at the in-jokes.<br></p><h2 id="h1294"><a id=""></a><strong>This is fine (laughs nervously)</strong></h2><p>There’s so much fun to be had in<em> Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s comedic sci-fi journalism world that it’s easy to just take it at face value. That wouldn’t be bad, it’s a fun and funny game! As you play, you’ll learn a bit about journalism along the way and enjoy the wonderfully written characters. But I can’t help but see something a little more sinister under the surface.</p><figure id="" data-id="e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-recommend-id="image://e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-recommend-id="image://e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not that the robo reporter is a thinly veiled metaphor for the influx of AI into journalism. I don’t think that is the case (<em>Kotaku</em> Staff would never take my job, right?), but rather the build-a-story structure encourages a mindset that equates good stories with readership going up. That might mean writing bad, sensational, or even outright false articles that twist the information you gained from sources can get you more eyes. Each hed, lede, and nutgraf option can be reduced to a number—as can an entire story. If it boosts numbers, it will keep a paper alive (hopefully). It’s a striking commentary on the state of modern media.<br></p><p>If this year’s satiric but more aggressive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-simulator-itch-indie-game-1851382388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-simulator-itch-indie-game-1851382388"><em>New York Times Simulator</em></a></span> is a less subtle game about the risks, responsibilities, and struggles of modern-day journalism, then <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em> takes the spoonful of sugar approach with sharp and funny writing that makes it endlessly entertaining—even if it stings a bit. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/leveraging-emotional-design-features-to-enhance-character-perception-in-pixel-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This article explores how emotional design features - colours and shapes - influence player perception of pixel art characters. By understanding these design elements, game developers can create characters that elicit specific emotional responses, improving player engagement and retention. The article includes practical tips on applying these findings to character design in pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relationship between character design and player perception is crucial for creating engaging gaming experiences. While previous research has focused on the impact of character appearance on player perceptions, there is limited knowledge about how emotional design features specifically affect pixel art characters. The research described in this article aims to bridge that gap, providing insights that can help developers create emotionally resonant characters using cost-efficient pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Value of Emotional Design Features">The Value of Emotional Design Features</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Character appearance significantly shapes player perceptions and emotional responses. Even the slightest alterations in a character's design can substantially change how players perceive and connect with them. Players often deeply empathise with non-playable characters in narrative-driven games like the Mass Effect series. This connection enhances the gaming experience and encourages player retention.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Colour and shape psychology is widely used in narrative-driven games, such as Mass Effect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Character appearance is formed by design choices, also called emotional design features. Colours and shapes are among the most basic emotional design features and among the few actually used in pixel art. This article aims to describe how and to what extent emotional design features impact character perception in pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Colour and Shape Psychology">Colour and Shape Psychology</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Colour and shape significantly influence players' emotional responses and perceptions in games. Warm colours like red and yellow evoke danger, excitement and energy, while cool colours like blue and green promote trust and calmness. Neutral colours, such as black and white, convey power and purity, respectively. Shapes also play a role: circles and curves are seen as friendly and safe, squares as stable and reliable, and triangles as dynamic and aggressive. Game developers can use these psychological principles to enhance character development and storytelling, creating more engaging and immersive gaming experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the sake of simplicity, this experiment was limited to 4 colours—3 primary and 1 secondary—and 3 shapes. Each colour and shape has strong associations, common in design psychology research.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Experiment Design Process">The Experiment Design Process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To see if this would apply to pixel art, we conducted an experiment among 48 participants, predominantly male (61%), with a balanced age distribution predominantly under 34 years old.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The participants were split into two groups—8 were observed in a controlled environment, while 60 others completed the experiment from their homes, providing insights into natural settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Participants were shown twelve characters individually, one by one, selecting associated traits from a predefined list. This was facilitated through a digital questionnaire available at https://mgtexp.com. A detailed experiment description is provided below to help understand its design and execution:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Character creation. Twelve pixel art characters were created using combinations of four colours (red, green, blue, purple) and shapes (circle, square, triangle). Each character featured a unique combination of colour and shape, such as red triangles, blue circles, green squares, etc. </span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hypotheses. A hypothesis was created for every character based on previous research – for example, the red triangular character would be perceived as “dangerous”, and the green round-shaped one as “friendly”.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data collection. Participants were shown the characters individually. For each character, they selected associated traits from a predefined list, choosing 48 traits in total – 3 for every character. Moreover, participants responded to personal questions about age group, gender, and gaming experience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Analysis. All responses were collected and subjected to statistical analyses to determine which colours and shapes were most strongly associated with each trait. The responses' correlation with personal data was also analysed. This analysis helped derive the conclusions discussed below.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data Insights">Data Insights</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on the data analysis, four different situations were determined:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">19 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was confirmed, and the data was statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">6 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was rejected due to the wrong hypothetical value, but the data was still statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05, meaning that there was a correlation between colour and shape and the resulting answers;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">6 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was rejected due to the statistical insignificance of the data at a significance level of 0.05, but the hypothetical value was still the most common answer;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">5 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was rejected due to the inconsistency of the answers, and the data was statistically insignificant at a significance level of 0.05.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the analysis, the participants' responses could be predicted at least for 25 characters out of 36. Some of the analyses have shown inconsistent results, suggesting that colours have a stronger impact on character perception than shapes. It was found that colours and shapes influence each other, alternating character perception when working together. Moreover, there seems to be a gender and personal experience bias in character perception for secondary colours.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Findings">Key Findings</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Primary Colours and Perception: Primary colours strongly influence character perception, consistently evoking specific emotional responses. For example, red signifies danger or excitement, while blue conveys calmness or sadness.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shapes and Their Interplay with Colours: Shapes impact character perception to a lesser extent than colours. However, the combination of colours and shapes can enhance or mitigate their individual effects. For example, a red triangle might be perceived as more aggressive than a red circle.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ambiguity of Secondary Colours: Secondary colours like purple tend to be more ambiguous and subject to personal interpretation, leading to less consistent emotional responses from players. It was also discovered that there could be a gender difference in how players perceive secondary colours.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Practical Application">Practical Application</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To apply these findings, game developers should consider the following:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Controlled Use of Primary Colours: Leveraging primary colours can create characters with predictable emotional impacts. For instance, using red for antagonistic or dangerous characters and blue for trustworthy allies can help establish clear emotional cues.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combining Colours and Shapes: Thoughtfully combining colours and shapes can enhance character design. For example, a friendly character might be designed using soft, round shapes and green colours. On the other hand, if the goal is to create a controversial character, mixing “positive” colours and “negative” shapes (and vice versa) can be considered.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Avoid Overuse of Secondary Colours: Given their ambiguous nature, secondary colours should be used sparingly and strategically to avoid inconsistent emotional responses. While purple is widely used as a “villain” colour in digital character design, the data suggests that this colour elicits mixed feelings if no other emotional design features specifically portray a character as a villain.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testing and Feedback: Regularly test character designs with target audiences to gauge their emotional responses and adjust designs accordingly. While the study's initial hypotheses were based on popular colour psychology patterns, only half were confirmed.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this research confirms that emotional design features significantly impact character perception in pixel art, its findings also suggest that players perceive secondary colours very subjectively. By understanding and applying these insights, game developers can create more engaging and emotionally resonant characters, improving player enjoyment and retention.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-cyberpunk-restaurant-sim-nivalis-gets-spring-2025-release-window.906678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nivalis-spring-2025-release-window<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Ion Lands has announced that&nbsp;<em>Nivalis</em>, the ambitious followup to cyberpunk taxi-driving sim&nbsp;<em>Cloudpunk</em>, is launching in spring 2025.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the same city as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/cloudpunk-review"><em>Cloudpunk</em></a>, but it'll offer a different type of gameplay; instead of ferrying packages around, you'll be running your very own cyberpunk restaurant, which could potentially blossom into a nightlife empire.</p>
<p>As you do so, you'll meet the locals, get to know them, and befriend them, and Ion Lands says you may even be able to find love, so it sounds like at least some of the city's inhabitants will be romanceable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nivalis-release-window-2025-restaurant.jpg?itok=a4-atA7v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nivalis-release-window-2025-restaurant.jpg?itok=qh4yhb6w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nivalis&nbsp;</em>offers a cyberpunk slice-of-life sim that looks pretty immersive.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as a cyberpunk city with 19 distinct districts to explore, Ion Lands is promising "realistic weather simulation and night and day cycles", as well as the ability to explore not only on foot but also by boat.</p>
<p>While on your boat, you'll also be able to go fishing, and although Ion Lands doesn't specify whether you'll be able to use the fish you catch as ingredients for your meals, that seems like a no-brainer to me.</p>
<p>Ion Lands has also released a brand new trailer for <i>Nivalis</i>, and it gives a look at some "never-before-seen locations", as well as dropping some hints as to what the game's story might be. You can check it out here.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a slice-of-life sim, you'll be able to decorate your very own home as well, and you'll be able to own multiple apartments.</p>
<p>There won't be any kind of combat element in the game either, so if you prefer your cyberpunk experiences a little more chilled-out and mellow, it looks like this one will be for you.</p>
<p>Technically, this spring 2025 release window constitutes a delay; the last we heard of&nbsp;<em>Nivalis</em>, it had a 2024 release window, so it's been pushed back a little. Let's hope that the extra time will let Ion Lands polish the game up and realize its full potential.</p>
<p><em>Nivalis&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> in spring 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The project was canceled in 2003, leading to the closure of the storied studio. However, despite never seeing the light of day, the game still looms large in the minds of <em>Fallout</em> fans, and now, series creator Tim Cain has provided fresh insight into the circumstances leading to its cancellation.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196903" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="189" data-playlist="196903,196646,196411" data-current="196903"><div><p>Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22460.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Cain details the cancellation of <em>Van Buren</em> in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag&amp;t=1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a></span> posted on June 19. In it, he explains how he may have had a hand in ultimately ending the original <em>Fallout 3.</em> To begin, the fact that he was involved in <em>Van Buren</em> at all is a fascinating detail given that he left <em>Fallout</em> developer and publisher Interplay in the middle of <em>Fallout 2</em>’s development. However, Cain reveals that in 2003, an Interplay vice president asked him to play a prototype of <em>Van Buren</em>. The project was already in trouble, with the VP telling Cain he planned on canceling it unless Cain could give him an estimate on development time that would reassure Interplay.</p><p>Cain played about two hours of the prototype and asked members of the development team several questions to get a better idea of the state the game was in. Eventually, Cain was able to determine a time frame. He told the VP, “I’m convinced in 18 months you could have a really good game shipped,” Cain recounts. The VP’s response was to ask if it could be done any faster. Cain did not recommend it, saying that even with a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577">death march crunch</a></span>” the game could not be completed in less than a year. At this point, the VP told him that any answer over six months was going to result in <em>Van Buren</em> being canceled. Cain jokes that the answer he gave got the game canceled, but notes that the game would have been canceled no matter what given the VP’s desired timeline. </p><p>Cain explains that Interplay, which had been experiencing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/the-last-days-of-black-isle-studios&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/the-last-days-of-black-isle-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial hardship</a></span> for years, simply couldn’t fund more than six months of development. Sure enough, <em>Van Buren</em> was canceled, Black Isle was closed, and all of its staff was laid off. Eventually, a game called <em>Fallout 3</em> made its way into the hands of gamers thanks to Bethesda, but <em>Van Buren</em> never did.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Game Freak, renowned for creating some of the most cherished Pokemon games, has announced a departure from its usual lineup with the upcoming release of Pand Land, a new RPG developed in partnership with Wonderland. Despite their extensive history with the Pokemon franchise, Game Freak is boldly venturing into uncharted territory with this exciting new game. Pand Land will be released later this month, and fans eagerly anticipate more details.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/game-freak-and-wonderplanet-announce-free-to-play-sailing-adventure-rpg-pand-land-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, Pand Land is a free-to-play, casual maritime adventure RPG released for iOS and Android on June 24, 2024. Pre-registration for Game Freak’s upcoming title is available now. It is important to note that Pand Land is currently only being released in Japan.</p>

<p>In Pand Land, players embark on a thrilling adventure as the captain of an expedition team in search of a legendary treasure.

With over 400 types of allies and treasures to discover, the game promises endless excitement. Moreover, you can share this adventure with your friends through the game’s online play feature.&nbsp;</p>

Titled Pokemon Legends Z-A, the game was unveiled with a cinematic trailer during the Pokemon Presents showcase earlier this year. Additionally, Take Two’s Private Division and Game Freak have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/project-bloom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnered up</a> to deliver a new action-adventure game codenamed Project Bloom. </p>



<p>We’re eager to hear your thoughts on Game Freak’s non-Pokemon RPG in the comments.</p>

<p>Bluepoint Games, a PlayStation-owned studio renowned for its top-tier remakes and remasters, has a rich gaming history with titles like the Demon’s Souls PS5 edition, Shadow of Colossus PS4 remake, and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake collection. Following their acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2021, they made a significant announcement of releasing original content. </p>



<p>While they couldn’t divulge much about it, their dedication to this project is evident. Fast forward three years, and it’s clear that they are still hard at work on this highly anticipated original content.</p>



<hr>



<p>Peter Dalton, the Head of Technology at Bluepoint Games, recently took to Twitter to express his admiration for FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki and Nintendo. In these challenging times for the gaming industry, their words of solidarity and approach towards the layoffs have been respectable and encouraging for Dalton. </p>



<p>In the same post, Dalton was asked about the status of Bluepoint Studio’s original content. His response was clear- “Nothing has changed since our statement that we are working on an original title”. He further emphasized that ‘everything takes time’ and they are committed to honing their skills, a sentiment that resonates with many in the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing has changed since our statement that we are working on an original title. Everything takes time.

</div></figure>



<p>It’s certainly good to hear that a developer is still working on something, as promised. However, some updates will be appreciated. It has been over three years since their announcement, so the least we can expect is a title and a release window, not even a gameplay trailer. However, on the flip side and in the words of Peter Dalton, everything good does take time, and maybe a bit of patience with Bluepoint Studio is something that is needed right now. Let’s wait to see what PlayStation and Bluepoint Games are cooking behind the scenes. </p>

        <p>Repayment comes from net proceeds received from Take-Two's purchase of Gearbox Entertainment</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Embracer Group is a step closer to clearing its debts after paying SEK 3.2 billion ($300 million) on its revolving credit facility.</p>
<p>The group told lenders today that it had made the repayment towards the credit it has borrowed. The full repayment is due by May 2025, and Embracer reported this installment is "in accordance with [the] plan."</p>
<p>The May deadline was part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-extends-credit-and-loan-agreements-amid-ongoing-restructure">extension agreements Embracer secured on its credit and loans</a> back in December.</p>
<p>The repayment was made possible by the net proceeds Embracer has already received from the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460-million">sale of Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive</a>. The $460 million deal was announced in March, and <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-closes-the-divestment-of-gearbox-entertainment/">completed last week</a>.</p>
<p>The group has also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-sells-saber-interactive-for-247m">sold Saber Interactive</a> and associated studios for $247 million.</p>
<p>Last month, Embracer's full-year financials showed that the group <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-full-year-sales-rise-to-39bn-but-15bn-debt-remains">still held debts of $1.5 billion</a>, but the divestments of Saber and Gearbox are expected to reduce this significantly.</p>
<p>The company is also moving €900 million of its debt into tabletop publisher Asmodee as part of its plans to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-splits-into-three-everything-you-need-to-know">split into three separate entities</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lars-wingefors-on-why-embracer-is-going-away-and-what-happens-next">CEO Lars Wingefors told GamesIndustry.biz</a> earlier this year: "The banks love Asmodee, they know the company has been highly leveraged on their private equity ownership for more than a decade. That amount is basically paying down the debt – not all, but most of the debt – in the remaining Embracer Group, meaning Coffee Stain &amp; Friends and Middle-Earth &amp; Friends."</p>
