            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/what-we-played-roadcraft-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-avowed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Steam Next Fest has been bubbling up behind the scenes all week, with so many game demos and announcements coming that I’m not even really sure when it’s starting. Some demos are out now, others are being run over the weekend, more are only coming out on Monday… but it means that if you have a PC and want to see what’s coming soon, you’ve got plenty to see and play this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of that, Dom and I played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/roadcraft-preview-where-were-going-we-need-to-build-roads/">RoadCraft</a>, a disaster recovery spin-off to the MudRunner series that really makes you feel like a kid in a sandpit. Add to that a game that would be Indiana Jones’ favourite management sim, and that’s my week of games.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> ramping up his gaming again, since his return from the other side of the planet. He enjoyed his time with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-review/">Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog</a>, a sci-fi visual novel, but this weekend has Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii booked in for review.</p>
<p>The love hate relationship with Alan Wake 2 has continued for <strong>Jim</strong>, who hit a roadblock with The Lake House DLC – “It solidified my opinion that while great at piecing together weird and compelling stories, Remedy doesn’t know how to pair this with interesting gameplay. It’s a shame as the final DLC is arguably the creepiest, zaniest part of the AW2 package – I just felt burned out after already putting some twenty something hours into the base game. I’ve now moved onto A Plague Tale: Innocence, hoping to wedge in a playthrough before Monster Hunter Wilds launches.”</p>


<p>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope would score highly on a password complexity checker, and it scores highly in <strong>Ade’s</strong> finely tuned “good game” checker as well – “It’s a brilliant TBS game, accessible, fun, and perfect for a quick half hour of gaming.” He’s also had some fun times blast giant bugs in the cities of Helldivers 2 this week.</p>
<p>Bemoaning the difficulty of trawling the PlayStation Store sales of full game gems – all the DLC listings just clutter up the joint, don’t they? – <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a broad spread of games to play this week, including the Tomb Raider 4-6 remakes, Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and Palworld. But he also did the important thing and grabbed a month of Game Pass in order to play Avowed… and about 15 other games on there that he was curious about.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played “the forbidden game” of trying to do his marking and being a dad taxi to his kids. In video games, he finished off Gears 5 and got through most of Hivebusters DLC, but found the game endings have sort of petered out and left too many threads dangling. So he moved on to play Eternal Strands, which has been enjoyable, and is checking out a bunch of demos from Steam Next Fest, with a good few write ups to come.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, as always, been playing Destiny 2.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-is-january-2025s-top-selling-game-according-to-us-sales-data.1115469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for January 2025, and given that it's a month without many significant releases, the number one seller for the month probably won't surprise you.</p>

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky thread</a> by Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is once again the month's biggest-selling game across all platforms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games" rel="nofollow">was also 2024's top-selling title</a>&nbsp;by Circana's reckoning.</p>

<p>In second place for the all-format chart is&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, which isn't surprising given the colossal commercial success of that franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>, while&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth&nbsp;</em>is in third, bolstered by its January PC release. Perhaps now, it can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">strive to meet Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=_9qjfds5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=49ipegHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s PC release helped it hit third place in Circana's January 2025 sales chart.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the all-format top five are&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to EA's expectations</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">couldn't be said to have underperformed</a> by any expectations in the known universe.</p>

<p>When it comes to specific formats,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>tops the PlayStation chart for January, while&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>tops the Xbox chart. As always, the Switch is dancing to its own tune; Nintendo's chart is dominated by&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>.</p>

<p>As for player engagement - that is, games on each platform ranked by monthly active users -&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is top of the chart on PlayStation, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>tops Xbox's chart.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">recently hit 40 million players</a>, is number one on Steam.</p>

<p>Spending as a whole across the industry fell by 15% compared to the same period last year, although as Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq42zqc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, January 2025 consists of four weeks rather than last year's five-week tracking period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=jbbUZD91 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=AE6L4Gpo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>topped Circana's Steam player engagement chart for January.</figcaption></figure><p>Hardware-wise, the PS5 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlznlf2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emerged victorious</a> once again in January, beating out the Xbox and Switch in units and dollar sales. Xbox was second in dollar sales, while Switch came second in units.</p>

<p>As ever, Piscatella's full thread is well worth a look if you want to see some other stats. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq23ems2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check the thread out here</a>.</p>

While EU regulations helped open up the App Store on the other side of the Atlantic, iPhones in the U.S. still don’t allow it, and while Android devices do, they still try to make users think that access the Epic Games Store will potentially infect their smartphone with a virus.</p><p>I went to download both <em>KOTOR 1 </em>and <em>2</em> last night and was immediately warned by Google about “harmful” files when I tried to install the Epic Games Store. Fortunately, Epic had a full-blown guide on how to navigate the warnings and restrictions and get it working anyway. It was simple enough, but would probably scare off anyone who has no idea what’s going and just wanted to play a cool <em>Star Wars</em> game on their lunchbreak. Still, it’s progress!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The PGA Tour 2K25 Trophy and Achievement list allows you to be successful on and off the course. Knowing the full list allows you to tee it up high, let it fly, and send your Achievements and Trophies counter into the sky.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> players managed to sneak onto the course through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>. But the whole community will swarm the golfing grounds soon after to see what’s what. They’ll find a varied list requiring you to show golf skills, be an expert orator, and be an online demon. </p>



<p>Let’s cut this warm-up session short and head to the first tee box.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">PGA Tour 2K25 Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An absolute stripe show. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 users must conquer 36 PlayStation Trophies to earn the Platinum. On the other hand, 35 Xbox Achievements are required to do a clean sweep of the available Gamerscore.</strong></strong></p>



<p>It’s the same old story with Trophies and Achievements: PlayStation players get one more intangible accomplishment courtesy of the Platinum Trophy. I’ve no idea why Microsoft still refuses to do something similar, but that’s neither here nor there!</p>



<p>Maybe we need a merger?</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pga-tour-2k25-achievement-amp-trophy">Every PGA Tour 2K25 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p><strong>This might be the toughest PGA Tour Trophy List to date</strong>. Usually, you can ride the coattails of the game’s easiest difficulty settings to get everything done. But <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a>‘s Achievement and Trophy list requires a certain degree of skill and commitment to online play.</p>



<p>I’m personally not a fan of online trophies and never have been, but it looks like my ball striking needs to be on point if I (or any of us) hope to complete this list.</p>

Bethesda in 2021, seeing the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-wastelanders-review-a-disappointing-ret/1900-6417458/" data-ref-id="1900-6417458">the Wastelanders expansion</a> before exiting the developer. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/">Fallout 76 became even more popular thanks to the Amazon TV series</a>, Gardiner still saw quite the turnaround for the online RPG. "When you put a game out that's that maligned, especially on a team that has had such success, the morale is doubly bad internally," Gardiner said. "So it was my job to make the people who are making the game like the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Gardiner takes pride in Fallout 76, pointing out how "it's a very unique game." The difficult journey with the title also has placed the online RPG as one of his top career achievements. "People always ask, 'What's your favorite game you’ve worked on?' Because [Fallout] 76 was such a difficult game and then it turned around to a successful game, it's actually probably my favorite," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">The game continues to change and evolve. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-biggest-expansion-yet-lets-you-pet-a-very-good-dog/1100-6528198/" data-ref-id="1100-6528198">Fallout 76 saw its biggest expansion yet with the Gleaming Depths update</a> in December, which lets you pet your Bombay Cat or German Shepherd dog. Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">Fallout 76 will let you become a ghoul</a> later this year. Fallout 76 is available on Game Pass. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-developer-says-it-wont-recast-voice-actors-or-use-ai.1115430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>developer Supergiant Games has released a statement responding to a voice actor's recent suggestion that they may be recast owing to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, voice actor Marin Miller, who voices characters like Athena in&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likgdz5k722f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said via Bluesky</a> that followers "may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular" because "the employer refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likglug3322f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>, Miller made it very clear they were referring to Supergiant, stating that "it would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors". By "flip", Miller presumably means they want Supergiant to put an interim agreement in place to allow them to continue working through the strike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=MpqsTd-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=EK1NZ2eu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>voice actor Marin Miller suggested they may be recast during the SAG-AFTRA strike, but Supergiant denies it.</figcaption></figure><p>Responding - albeit indirectly - to Miller's post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lin7soibi22o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky</a>, Supergiant says it hasn't recast any of its&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>actors and that it doesn't intend to do so. The studio also says it "ha[s] respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work" due to the strike.</p>

<p>Supergiant then says that none of its games have been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons", but that its own contracts "offer the strongest AI protections in the industry" and that its games are "intentionally made by human beings", pledging not to use generative AI in the creation of&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>

<p>So far, it doesn't look like Miller has responded to Supergiant on social media. It's possible we may hear from them in the coming days, or that Miller has decided to contact Supergiant directly to continue the dialog.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>itself, development on the game continues apace. Released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, the game sees Princess of the Underworld&nbsp;Melinoë battling the forces of Chronos, the Titan of Time.</p>




<p>Earlier this week, Supergiant released the Warsong Update for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, adding a number of new features to the game. You can check out the full patch notes for that update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. You can check out our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hades-ii-preview-godlike-first-impression" rel="nofollow">preview of the game here</a> if you want to know how it stacks up compared to its predecessor.</p>

She spins a yarn about her crew going feral and slaying one another, but her demeanor is quite antagonistic.

Surprisingly, she’s telling you the truth about what went down on the island. Granted, whether you opt to help her or not should depend on what type of person you’d like your character to be and what type of playthrough you’re aiming for, but there are definitely positive reasons for freeing this prisoner.</p><p>For starters, she’ll accompany you through the remainder of the island and help you fight off foes that stand in your way. Additionally, a quest you encounter later in Dawnshore (which we won’t spoil here) will go much more smoothly if Ilora has been freed.</p><p>Alternatively, choosing not to free Ilora will result in you having to fight her at the end of the tutorial, as well as the aforementioned quest having a far less peaceful turnout. So, ya know, you could just save yourself the trouble and free her. Or if it’s trouble you’re after, leave her behind bars.</p><figure id="" data-id="e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-recommend-id="image://e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-recommend-id="image://e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h116811"><a id=""></a><strong>How to free Ilora in <em>Avowed</em></strong></h2><p>To free Ilora, climb the box in the corner of the room where she’s being held prisoner.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-peripherals-maker-corsair-clarifies-gta-6-pc-early-2026-release-date-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair has clarified recent comments from one of its executives who claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> would release on PC early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a financial call, Corsair Gaming’s VP of finance, Ronald van Veen, said: “Yeah, GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we’ll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early 2026 for PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to spark a number of headlines about Corsair’s apparent insider information on GTA 6’s release window, but a representative of the company told IGN that Ronald van Veen’s comments were speculation, and confirmed Corsair does not have release dates supplied from Rockstar or Take-Two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Take-Two recently committed to launching GTA 6 fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only</a>, despite concern around a potential delay. But what does this mean for the PC version, which remains unannounced?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Nvidia's new 50-series graphics cards just aren't as good at running certain older games as previous hardware generations were, some PC gamers have discovered. With its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has quietly removed support for PhysX, a physics simulation technology that was used in a number of popular titles in the early 2010s.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/rtx_50_series_silently_removed_32bit_physx_support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, one user questioned why PhysX was suddenly turned off by default, or when turned on was forced to run on the CPU--causing major performance issues in games designed for GPU-enhanced PhysX. Responding to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/557200/geforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325/3501715/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the Nvidia forums</a>, the company confirmed that PhysX has effectively been discontinued, due to Nvidia ending support for 32-bit CUDA applications for 50-series graphics cards and future generations. While the end of support for 32-bit CUDA was noted in a <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615/~/support-plan-for-32-bit-cuda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brief support article</a>, Nvidia never explicitly mentioned the impact to PhysX, or noted which games might be impacted with the sunsetting of this technology.</p><p>PhysX's GPU-accelerated physics tech was acquired by Nvidia in 2008, and its realistic simulation of moving cloth, liquids, smoke and fog, and shatter particle effects was implemented in a number of popular AAA games of the time--including Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, the Batman: Arkham trilogy, and the first two Metro games.</p><p>While PhysX is now mostly defunct and hasn't been implemented in new games for some time, many gamers were still disappointed to discover it had been discontinued without warning. Users on the Resetera forums have since banded together to create a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of games</a> that will be impacted by the end of PhysX support. The list also notes how well each game will run when using the CPU for PhysX, with users testing each game individually. The full list includes a little under 50 games, but include some popular titles from the period between 2007-2014.</p><p>Previous Nvidia generations, including the 40-, 30-, and 20- series will continue to support 32-bit CUDA applications, meaning gamers who play a lot of older games may be better to stick to an older graphics card for the time being. As is standard for a new generation of graphics cards, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-where-to-buy-new-nvidia-gpu/1100-6528684/" data-ref-id="1100-6528684">new 50-series GPUs</a> are pretty hard to find at the moment, anyway.</p>

                <p>Author George R.R. Martin, who was involved in coming up with some of the lore of From Software's Elden Ring, has commented on the possibility of the game becoming a movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-reveals-there-is-some-talk-about-making-a-movie-out-of-elden-ring-but-theres-one-big-obvious-thing-that-could-limit-his-involvement-with-it-ign-fan-fest-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Martin said he "can't say too much about it," but did indeed confirm that there is "some talk about about making a movie out of Elden Ring."</p><p>In Hollywood, nothing is certain, so no one should get their hopes up to see an Elden Ring movie soon, or ever. Martin acknowledged this, saying "we'll see" if the movie "comes to pass." Even if an Elden Ring movie does materialize, Martin said he's not sure what the extent of his involvement could be. "I don't know," he said, before going on to acknowledge that he's "a few years behind" on his long-awaited Winds of Winter. "So that limits the amount of things that I can do," he said.</p><p>Before this, From Software's own Hidetaka Miyazaki said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-there-is-interest-dev-says/1100-6524511/" data-ref-id="1100-6524511">"some interest" in an Elden Ring movie, but the team wants to be careful about finding the right partner for it. </a></p><p>Back in 2021, Bandai Namco said Elden Ring was already being developed for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">"variety of other areas,"</a> and many took this to mean some kind of film or TV adaptation. Nothing has materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Elden Ring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-rapidly-catching-up-to-dark-souls-sales/1100-6528496/" data-ref-id="1100-6528496">sold nearly 30 million copies</a> to rank as one of the best-selling RPGs ever. Given the immense commercial success of the game, along with Martin's involvement, it's no surprise to hear Hollywood studios might be interested in trying to adapt it. Next up for the game is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Nightreign</a> standalone co-op spinoff, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">launches this May.</a></p><p>It's still early days for a potential Elden Ring movie, and there is no word yet on if it's animated or live-action, or who may direct and star in it. As for confirmed releases, the next two video game movies on tap are A Minecraft Movie (April 4) and Until Dawn (April 25).</p><p>Check out the gallery below to see some of the other video game movies in the works now.</p>

                <p>A couple of years ago, the idea of PlayStation-exclusive games being ported to PC would have seemed highly unlikely, but times have changed. Insomniac's Spider-Man games, Housemarque's Returnal, and the Horizon series are just a few of the big PlayStation properties that have recently made their way to PC since 2020, and former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida recently spoke about how doing so was almost like having a license to print money.</p><p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles--especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," Yoshida said in an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money" rel="nofollow ">Push Square</a>). "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation. It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title. So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p><p>The benefit to Sony's push into PC gaming is that it has also allowed it to reach very lucrative markets like China, where PCs are far more popular than consoles. "China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience," Yoshida added.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/">Sony's next PC port will be The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which comes shortly after the release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 earlier this year. Yoshida has participated in several interviews since he bid farewell to Sony in January, a company he worked at for 38 years. Starting in 2019, Yoshida was put in charge of a new indies initiative for Sony, a position <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/">that he says he had no choice to accept at the time</a> as it was either that or he would have been forced to leave the company.</p><p>Yoshida has also spoken candidly about how he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/">attempted to "resist" the push into live-service games</a> had he still been SIE president and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/">why there is no Bloodborne remaster</a> yet.</p>

            <p>Netflix has joined the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> film project, adapting Sloclap's kung-fu roguelike for the big screen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-getting-live-action-movie-adaptation-from-john-wick-writer-1">project was first revealed in 2022</a>, with <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects">Story Kitchen</a> producing - that's the company behind other video game adaptations like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog films</a>, the forthcoming Tomb Raider and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streets-of-rage-movie-in-development">Streets of Rage</a> adaptations, and more.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/netflix-sifu-t-s-nowlin-chad-stahelskis-producing-1236295230/">Deadline</a> has reported, Netflix is now on board and has tapped TS Nowlin to write the script, while inside sources have said Chad Stahelski and his 87Eleven Entertainment company have joined as producers. Sloclap is also officially involved.</p>

<p>Nowlin is best known for adapting The Maze Runner book series into film, and also wrote the 2022 Netflix film The Adam Project, which starred Ryan Reynolds and Zoe Saldana.</p>
<p>87Eleven, meanwhile, is developing various projects including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Sony's Ghost of Tsushima film</a>, a Rainbow Six film starring Michael B Jordan, a new Highlander film with Henry Cavill, and more.</p>
<p>Story Kitchen partner Derek Kolstad was previously linked with the project, following his work on the John Wick films. The Sifu adaptation was described as "John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan's Old".</p>
<p>Sloclap's game follows a young martial artist seeking vengeance against the death of his master. Thanks to a magical talisman, he's resurrected after each death but ages every time until old age eventually makes his death permanent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">game reviewed well</a> and proved popular, following Sloclap's previous action game Absolver.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sifu has been adapted either, after it featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>Next for Sloclap is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">football action game Rematch</a>, which promises a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-out-now-with-game-ready-driver-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tomorrow-in-delta-force-black-hawk-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> integrated support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation as part of the game's third update. The game was also updated to support the latest DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution transformer-based AI models, which offer improved quality, as well as Ray Reconstruction, which improves ray tracing. Ray traced shadows also now optionally include all light sources, significantly increasing the quality of shadows in interior locations. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> also reveal good news for AMD and Intel owners, too:</p>
<p><em>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, the third Indiana Jones and the Great Circle adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology, allowing players without GeForce RTX 40 or 50 graphics cards to take advantage of frame generation in the game. Lastly, the patch&nbsp;also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<p>There are also a few technical fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements have been made to environment lights to present a more natural appearance when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency mode would cause inconsistent frame rates</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Nvidia Frame Generation became disabled when HDR was toggled on</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Indy’s hair was missing in reflections when using Path Tracing</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with light leaks in underground locations in Gizeh when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>As we had assumed, the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair feature</a> is not available in this update. Indeed, the patch notes mention it as a possible addition for future Indiana Jones and the Great Circle updates alongside HUD modification, which the community has requested.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has released the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Lawless update for Chapter 6 Season 2, and it's bringing sweeping heist-themed changes to the map, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover and much more.</p>

<p>New crime-themed locations like the Hostile Hotel, the Wise Guys Bookstore, and the Launder Mat (I see what you did there, Epic) have been added to the map, as well as "high-end hangout luxury spa" the Outlaw Oasis and the rather unfortunately-named Shiny Shafts mining operation.</p>

<p>You'll also have the opportunity to do battle with the lupine crime boss Fletcher Kane, and beating him will reward you with a Mythic Pistol and a Medallion that increases your sprint speed. Of course, like all Medallions, it'll also reveal your location to other players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=YzfNuClL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=wr7ZQZ0m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Season has more than just crime-themed updates to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned changes, you'll also find the hip-hop duo known as the Tasty Bois making their debut in this Season, and their debut track "Runamok" is available as a Jam Track in the new Battle Pass.</p>

<p>As a reminder, XP earned in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s gameplay modes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">now contributes to Battle Passes</a> across all of those modes, so you won't need to stick to Battle Royale to earn enough XP to play that track in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>.</p>

<p>Included in the new Season's Battle Pass are a number of skins, many of them originals; you'll be able to get the likes of Big Dill, Fletcher Kane, and Cassidy Quinn as skins if you pick up the paid pass.</p>

<p>However, you'll also get access to Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero, who's joining the pass as&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover skin. Prominent&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>leaker Shiina has also <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1890484917613498532" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that revenant Scorpion will be available later in the season.</p>




<p>In addition to all of the above, Chapter 6 Season 2 also brings&nbsp;<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>-themed quests, new gameplay systems to engage with across&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new map, and much more. You can read the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/run-amok-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-2-lawless?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full rundown of what's new right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free across pretty much every platform going. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-friends-pass-will-support-crossplay-on-any-platform.1115337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>Friend's Pass will allow you and a friend to enjoy the co-op adventure together on any platform, as long as at least one of you owns the full game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> detailing the Friend's Pass, EA says that you can invite a friend to play with you for free on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and it doesn't matter which platform you're playing on; "as long as one of you owns the game, both of you can play".</p>

<p>This works in a similar way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em></a>'s Friend Pass, which also allowed you and a friend to play the whole game together with just one copy, although that pass didn't support crossplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=6fQ3REuh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=YciDjkgj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>studio Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>The Friend's Pass can also be used as a demo to let you and a friend experience the first few levels of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>. All you need to do is download the Pass, make sure your friend has done the same, and fire the Pass version of the game up on your platform of choice.</p>

<p>What's more, the Friend's Pass can be used any number of times, so as long as you're playing with someone who owns the full game, your Friend's Pass will work, whether or not you've already used it.</p>

<p>Of course, if all of this doesn't sound like your bag, you can still enjoy&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in local co-op. There are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">plenty of things</a> about which to (heavily) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">criticize EA</a>, but this isn't one of them, it seems to me.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees two writers, Mio and Zoe, "trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas". You'll bounce between sci-fi and fantasy worlds, solving co-op puzzles and learning more about both characters in the process.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 6th. You can take a look at our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow">very enthusiastic preview of the game here</a>.</p>

Here’s where to find the hidden room in Fort Northreach.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h121694"><a id=""></a><strong>How to find the hidden room in Fort Northreach</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-recommend-id="image://e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The location of the switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The location of the switch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-recommend-id="image://e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The location of the switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll spend the very beginning of the game getting used to the controls and following some tutorials as you work your way across a small island.

Eating this will temporarily improve how much damage you do to Kith (any humanoid enemies), making it a good food to chomp down on before facing the boss of this tutorial area.</p><hr><p>For finding the hidden room, you’ll also earn the “Hawkeye” achievement.

The first was acquiring a small PC game store called Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it. The second was building out its own PC game store and using Twitch’s popularity to drive players toward it. Finally, there was Luna, Amazon’s game streaming service. </p><p>None of these made a dent, and efforts by EA, Ubisoft, Bethesda and other publishers to build stores by locking their respective PC games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/desktop-launcher-pc-review-ea-battle-net-ubisoft-app-1850489703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/desktop-launcher-pc-review-ea-battle-net-ubisoft-app-1850489703">behind annoying proprietary launchers</a></span> eventually failed as well. Even the Epic Games Store, launched back in 2017, is still a <em>Fortnite</em> launcher first and a Steam rival second. Despite giving away tons of free games every year to people just for logging on, Epic’s storefront feels like its stalled out (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053">though lots of new features are on the way in 2025</a></span>). <br></p><p>“The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam,” Evans wrote. “It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well. At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren’t going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.”</p><p>What the retired executive is essentially saying is that Amazon thought people would show up simply because it was Amazon, when if it really wanted to take Steam on, it needed to actually give players a reason to switch. “We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so,” he wrote. “And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either. Just because you are big enough to build something doesn’t mean people will use it.” It’s a testament to Valve as much as it’s an indictment of C-suite brain rot. </p><p>For all of the valid criticism of Steam—the lack of moderation, terrible discovery tools, Nazi-ridden forums, and aging infrastructure—it still works pretty damn well. Then you have all of the ecosystem lock-in, from the social network aspect to new Steam sales adding more cheap games to players’ libraries every season. Plus it’s now basically the de facto launching ground for the biggest unexpected hits of any given year, from<em> Balatro</em> to <em>Palworld</em>. In addition to everything else, Steam is one of the main drivers of the attention economy around gaming, which is why a cool timed exclusive might hit the Epic Games Store and you never hear a peep about it. </p><p>It doesn’t feel great that one company controls so much about one of the largest and fastest-growing ways people play games, but then again it also sucked when companies tried to compete by making everyone maintain five different windows for booting up PC games. Maybe instead of competing for market share and platform dominance, more companies could follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG in creating a DRM-free</a></span> future for PC gaming. Unlikely, but no more so than unseating Steam at this point. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes reward you for playing the game. It’s a nice feeling, in all honesty, and to make sure you don’t miss out on new rewards such as clothes and consumables, we’ve got the latest PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes for February 2025.</p>



<p>2K has a habit of including Codes and Keys across its games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a> is known for using Shift Keys to give players in-game bonuses. Whereas most of 2K’s sports games use the Locker Codes feature. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the latest example of incorporating Locker Codes into the gameplay.</p>



<p>Codes can be hidden in the game or on social media. But they’re not so hidden when we’re around.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-active-pga-tour-2k25-locker-code-amp-reward-february-2025">Every Active PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Code &amp; Reward (February 2025)</h2>

<p><strong>You can find every working PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Code below. We’ve provided information on the exact characters of the code you need to enter and the reward for doing so.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s every <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a> Locker Code available right now.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Enter, if you dare. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to go to the Settings menu, find the Locker Code Redemption, and input the code to secure your free goodies in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is very straightforward, but here are the steps to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to PGA Tour 2K25’s home menu screen.</li>



<li>Head to your <strong>Profile Menu</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Flick through the options until you get to <strong>Redeem Locker Code</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on it.</li>



<li>Enter one of the Active PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes.</li>



<li>Confirm your choice to receive the applicable bonus!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-expired-locker-codes">PGA Tour 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are currently no expired Locker Codes in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, the game is still very new, so any active codes valid from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> launch are still going strong. You don’t have to miss out if you get on the codes above early enough. But don’t expect it to stay this way.</p>



<p>Make sure you keep checking back to see if any new codes are available. Plus, it’s always handy to know which no longer works.</p>



<hr>



<p>2K will likely add new PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes. The goodies likely vary from code to code, so ensure you’re not missing out on good stuff. Which rewards are you most desperate to be included as part of Locker Codes?</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company has won "substantial" damages after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-sues-chinese-clone-seeks-62m-and-public-apology">long-running battle against a Chinese mobile rip-off</a>, following years of legal wrangling.
</p>
<p>
While the final amount has not been made public, The Pokémon Company previously said it was owed $72m (£57m) by the makers of an unlicensed Pocket Monsters smartphone app that clearly used Pokémon characters and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company looked to have initially won its case last September, though two of the companies involved (Guangzhou Maichi Network Technology and Khorgos Fangchi Network Technology) appealed the decision, prompting a further delay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-reaches-costly-settlement-in-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-over-chinese-mobile-game/">Automaton</a>).

<p>
Now, a Chinese court has decided upon the matter for good, and the companies have been forced to admit defeat and issue a public apology.
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply realised that our acts had violated relevant laws during the second-instance trial and settlement process," the companies said in a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_news__2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9.pdf">joint public statement, published on The Pokémon Company's corporate website</a>. "[Our] game has extensively used design elements of the well-known Pokémon video game series, infringing the copyrights related to the Pokémon video games, and has unfairly taken advantage of the fame and reputation of the Pokémon video games, thereby constituting acts of unfair competition. 
</p>
<p>
"Our copyright infringement and acts of unfair competition have caused significant economic losses to the rights holders and severely damaged the image of the original Pokémon video games. We hereby sincerely apologise to TPC and other rights holders, as well as the vast number of players, consumers, and the general public."
</p>
<p>
The game, known variously as Pocket Monster: Remake or Pocket Monster: Issue/Reissue, has now been permanently removed from sale. The companies behind the game also say they have paid "a substantial economic price and incurred significant reputational damage".
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply reflected on it and learned our lessons."
</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Fortnite maker Epic Games forced a competitive cheater to publicly apologise</a> after unfairly winning thousands of dollars in prize money. The money was taken back, the cheat was banned from playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> competitively for life, and they had to publish a humiliating public message as a stark warning to others.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;Wētā announces that the game's new release date will be July 29th. Rather endearingly, the studio says it wants&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>"to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth" for all players, "no matter where you play".</p>

<p>While the platform isn't mentioned by name, that wording could suggest that the delay has been put into place to make sure the Switch version of the game is up to par, given that the console is significantly less powerful than its peers.</p>

Well, it wouldn't be a hobbit life sim without those things, I suppose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no sweetener to go along with this announcement, so if you were hoping to try out a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>demo ahead of the game's release, it looks like you're out of luck, at least for now.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, it's a cozy life sim set in the sleepy hobbit village of Bywater, where you'll be able to carve out a life for yourself as a peace-loving hobbit. Don't worry; you won't be tasked with throwing any rings into any volcanoes.</p>

<p>Instead, you'll be fishing, chatting to the locals, and arranging your hobbit-hole so that it looks just right. In general, if you've ever fantasized about living life in the Shire and shirking all of that pesky adventure nonsense, this is the game for you.</p>




<p>Revealed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-shire-announed" rel="nofollow">September 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles" rel="nofollow">set for a 2024 launch</a>, but was subsequently delayed to 2025, eventually receiving the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date" rel="nofollow">March release date</a> (which sadly no longer stands).</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on July 29th.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/persona">Persona</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> composer Shoji Meguro is making a turn-based sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about private military companies gunning through the ashes of a nuclear war. He's working with Ilya Kuvshinov, the illustrator who created character designs for Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045, and Lotus Juice, a rapper who has contributed sick beats to any number of Personae. So if nothing else Guns Undarkness is probably going to look and sound quite fancy.</p>
<p>But how does it play? Meguro has made his name as a musician: I have no idea how well that expertise translates to designing combat systems. It's something to think about while you watch and listen to the below trailer for the game's first demo, out on 24th February.

Published by Kodansha, Guns Undarkness is set in 2045 and is a story about a social divide and, oh hey woah! They are certainly invoking some... rich material with this one. As summarised on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801140/Guns_Undarkness/">Steam</a>, the game takes place following a near-future period "of abeyance that allowed technology to flourish, but deepened the social divide between the rich and the poor, the Haves and the Have Nots". Please tell me those aren't the literal faction names.</p>
<p>Apparently, a bunch of "primitivist" poor people got together to pull off a "Great Reset" in the shape of a worldwide nuclear war. Now, it's up to your rookie soldier "to discover the truth behind love in a world wracked by devastation and whether humanity is capable of being revolutionized."
</p>
<p>
For context, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset">the "Great Reset" in reality</a> was an initiative launched by the World Economic Forum to kindle economic growth (or at least, further enrich the plutocrats) following the Covid 19 pandemic lockdowns. It's also the name of a bunch of conspiracy theories which hold that corporations are trying to brainwash people with vaccines so as to destroy the very concept of property. So there is... ample topicality to unpack here, given some pretty delicate writing, and the Steam page blurb is anything but. It cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> as an inspiration, which worries me further - I'm not sure any other video game writer has Kojima's ability to somehow clown his way through a bunch of realworld parallels without setting anything on fire.
</p>
<p>

Still, let's shelve those concerns for the moment, and talk about the game's combat. You control a squad of four, including your protagonist, who venture out to mission maps from a submarine base. Battles are initiated during exploration by sneakily stacking people up at cover points and taking a pop at the foe - kind of like synchronising killshots in Rainbow Six, except that it's the prelude to a turn-based brawl. 
</p>
<p>
There are two broad kinds of action - regular attacks, which don't consume points, and skills, which are more powerful but do consume points. If you're in cover, however, you can fire off skills for free. If you're out of cover and you attack an enemy's weakpoint with a regular attack, "you'll be able to duck into cover". So a free move, then? 
</p>
<p>
There are also buffs and debuffs applied by guns, which level up separately to characters. Oh, and there's a Persona-style reputation system with characters improving their capabilities when fighting alongside their best mates. It seems like they have the makings of an enjoyably synergistickal framework, here. With any luck the game will be all about those synergies and not some kind of veiled/accidental piece of anti-vaxxer propaganda.
</p>
<p>
Guns Undarkness is out sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
