            <p>In good news for those saddened by their inability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFPl27xoxg">stamp on Hitler's head</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, Machine Games are once again making noises about developing a third Wolfenstein game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">a No-Clip documentary</a> about the previous two MachineGames-created Wolfenstein games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a> - studio head Jerk Gustafsson commented briefly that they still have an outline for a third game, and "hope" to someday complete the story of B.J. Blazkowicz.</p>
<p>"That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," the developer observed. "I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p>
<p>I find the prospect of a third Wolfenstein game from MachineGames... interesting. Few big budget shooters have courted the thunder of Topicality quite like New Colossus, an alternate-history fable set in a United States that has been conquered by the Nazis. Back in 2017, I offered some rather grandiose and theory-drenched Opinions about how New Colossus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-politics">"takes the white dudebro hero apart"</a>, following the election of Donald Trump. Hunter Pauli <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/b-j-blazkowicz-and-the-shallow-diversity-of-games">wrote a great rebuttal</a>, commenting that "for a series built around the deconstruction of Aryan bodies, it's taken a long time for players to take the hint that Wolfenstein's ubermensch William Blazkowicz is Jewish."</p><p>I don't know about you, but 2017 feels like a billion years ago to me. Since then, Trump has won a second term and initiated a bunch of crackpot and draconian measures against migrants and marginalised people. Russia have invaded Ukraine in what has become the largest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. Israel are shelling and starving hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza with the US government's backing - an invasion that has contributed to a crisis of legitimacy in the USA and UK, where elites characterise support for Palestinians as terrorism.</p>
<p>I do not envy any Wolfenstein writer trying to make something approximating a mainstream commercial first-person shooter that alludes to any of this. But then again, there is no such thing as "a simpler time".</p>
<p>In terms of the business of games development, the ground has also shifted considerably beneath MachineGames' feet. They're now owned by Microsoft, via the latter's purchase of ZeniMax Media. Microsoft, of course, are on something of a cost-cutting spree. As reported by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106506/machinegames-financials-reveals-indiana-jones-developer-has-6-profit-margin/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook">Tweaktown</a>, MachineGames made <a href="https://www.allabolag.se/bokslut/machinegames-sweden-ab/uppsala/datautveckling-systemutveckling-programutveckling/2K34T6JI5YDOJ">a small profit in 2024</a>, but that means nothing without understanding how it fits into the parent company's wider fortunes. MachineGames have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/wolfenstein-machinegames-cancelled-unannounced/">cancelled at least one unannounced game between 2022 and 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, stand accused of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">abetting the genocide in Gaza while quelling internal criticism of their business links to Israel</a>. A number of ZeniMax staff have signed an <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">open letter</a> calling for Microsoft to divest from the Israeli armed forces.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2700-dell-laptop-is-practically-free-right-now-with-amazon-clearing-stock-until-it-sells-out-2000623966</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2700-dell-laptop-is-practically-free-right-now-with-amazon-clearing-stock-until-it-sells-out.1291317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell is one of those omnipresent American brands that dominate the mass laptop market, and if you need to gear up for back-to-school or switch out your office configuration, Amazon just debuted a deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>
<p>Now, the Dell Inspiron <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/">15-inch touchscreen laptop (Intel 10 Core i5 1334U, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD) can be purchased for $699, down from its usual $2,699 price tag</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 74% discount</strong> and it brings a premium-level device into a price range that feels almost unbelievable. On top of that, you’ll get a <strong>free 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Yet Affordable</h2>
<p>The heart of this device is its <strong>13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor which has 10 cores and 12 threads</strong> to make multitasking responsive without slowing you down. Toss in generous 32GB of DDR4 RAM and you have the room to run all your day-to-day applications and resource-intensive tasks simultaneously without skipping a beat.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD also offers plenty of space for files, movies, and downloads, and keeps start-up quick and applications snappy. No longer just sitting around waiting for stuff to load: everything just opens up immediately. For students with speedy access needed to class material or businesspeople working on large projects, that kind of performance is a huge difference in everyday use.</p>



<p>And of course, the screen is a major part of the experience and Dell hasn’t cut corners on it: This Inspiron laptop<strong> features a 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> with an anti-glare finish and narrow borders so you enjoy sharp images and vibrant colors without distracting reflections. It’s the kind of screen that makes video calls clear and day-to-day browsing easier on the eyes. Combined with Intel Iris Xe graphics, you’ll also enjoy smoother graphics for light gaming or creative use like photo editing.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is offered in this laptop, so you’ll get faster and more stable internet connections which is perfect if you spend a lot of time streaming, working from home, or on video calls. On top of Bluetooth and a solid port set, like Type-C, Type-A, HDMI, and even an SD card reader, you already have enough flexibility to attach your favorite peripherals or extend your setup with ease. And to top it all off, <strong>the bundle includes an 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>&nbsp;so more ports to connect external monitors, storage devices, or even wired broadband with RJ-45.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro in S Mode comes pre-installed with business-ready features available along with a personal and streamlined environment. That is, you can upgrade your workflow from day one without the additional time of configuring. And yet the device depends on performance and functionality without compromising on a sleek, modern design in black that slices well on a desk or on the move.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t tend to linger long during high-demand periods like back-to-school, so if you’ve been considering an upgrade, this price drop makes the decision an easy one.</p>

			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the third entry in the series created by Hideo Kojima, the pachislot version released a few years ago doesn't look bad at all, even surpassing the Unreal Engine 5 remake developed by Virtuos in some regards.</p>



<p>Two new comparison videos shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> on YouTube put the remake running side by side with the HD remake developed by Bluepoint which was re-released two years ago as part of the Master Collection Vol.1 on PC and consoles and recordings of the same cutscenes recreated for the pachislot version of the game, highlighting how the latter don't look bad at all, sometimes even surpassing the Unreal Engine 5-powered remake in some instances like lighting, although this was to be expected, considering these cutscenes are not running in real time.</p>

<p>Despite launching with issues, including a 60 FPS cap on PC, which can be increased with mods, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has proven to be a smashing success, becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">a million seller</a> right on day one, as confirmed by Konami last week. The game's success on the market was fully expected, considering this is the first new release in the series in a long time and the fact that all the changes made to the original experience enhance it quite a bit without taking away what still makes Snake Eater one of the best entries in the series, if not the very best.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-trainer-plush-n-marnie-lillie-2000623942</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-finally-lets-us-cuddle-the-trainers.1291299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For too long <em>Pokémon</em> games have set us as rivals to other trainers, forced to complete against the likes of N, Leon and Marnie, rather than provide them with what they truly need: support and love. But thankfully that’s all about to end with the arrival of trainer plushies on the Pokémon Center store.</p> <p>It’s quite something that this hasn’t happened before. But as The Pokémon Company continues its true purpose—<a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-evolved-pokemon-plush-gengar-gardevoir-2000618808">creating plushies of everything imaginable</a>—its attention has finally turned to the human component of the games. Five trainers have arrived on the store in snuggly form: Lillie (<em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>)<em>,</em> Cynthia (<em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>)<em>,</em> N (<em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>), Leon, and Marnie (both <em>Sword</em> and<em> Shield</em>). Each is depicted in a chibi style, rather than their more lifelike appearance in the games, between seven and nine inches tall.</p> <p>There do seem good reasons to have gone for the short, big-headed chibi approach, given the somewhat <em>problematic</em> nature of some fans’ relationships with the human characters in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games. Characters like Lillie, for instance, are 11, while people like Marnie and Cynthia are ambiguously aged, most likely a teenager and a 20-something respectively. Within the world of the card game, such characters tend to fetch the highest resale prices, with the grim term “waifu tax” usually applied. (N is 20, and Leon is “an adult” for what it’s worth, while Leon’s little brother Hop surprisingly isn’t included in this first set.) Life-size plushies of any of them would be…a whole thing, and even to-scale renditions could get weird. Certainly even more troubling ground than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-life-sized-gardevoir-plush-import-center-buy-1851752663">$449 life-size Gardevoir</a> that’s as <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10419-101/gardevoir-poke-plush-63-in">sold out</a> as you’d expect.</p>

 <p>Anyway, the result is super-cute human plushies for the very first time. Leon seems like a great choice, especially if you buy a Charizard to go with him, but I imagine N and Marnie will be the two most popular, given the former was such a charming rival in&nbsp;<em>Black&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>White</em> as the leader of Team Plasma, while Marnie’s meanness and Dark-type preferences made her the most entertaining rival in&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em>.</p> <p>It does rather raise the question of which other game characters should receive the plushie transition. My preference has to be&nbsp;<em>Diamond</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pearl</em>‘s Barry, but purely because “Barry” is such a funny name for a child to have. It is a name only allowed to truck drivers in their 40s. No child should ever be called Barry. Carmine from&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s DLC is another obvious choice, because she was just so damn cool. Oh, and to state the obvious, Misty and Brock! Oh, and please may we not forget Opal. Presumably the only reason there’s no Grusha in this first set is because it’s impossible to capture that beautiful boy in any doll.</p> <p>Oh it got weird again.</p> <p>These new trainer plushies are currently available on the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-au/category/new-releases">Australian</a>, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/new-releases">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-nz/category/new-releases">New Zealand</a> stores, and will appear on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/new-releases">the U.S. store</a> in the next couple of hours.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a more challenging game than its predecessor, but a few mods released online in the past few days can make the experience more manageable and fun without breaking the difficulty and making the entire experience a walk in the park.</p>



<p>An essential mod to download, even for those who aren't finding the game too difficult, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/21?">Always Have Compass Effect mod</a>, which always shows Hornet's position on the map without equipping the Compass, freeing up a charm slot for more beneficial effects. Unfortunately, this mod isn't compatible with the Game Pass version of the game.</p>



<p>Another Hollow Knight: Silksong mod that can make the experience more balanced without breaking difficulty is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/57">No More 2 Damage Plus mod</a>, which reduces every damage Hornet takes to just one point per hit. While this sounds like a small tweak, it's actually a rather big one against certain enemies with rapid-hitting attacks that can destroy Hornet quickly, making the game somewhat more fair.</p>



<p>The third and final Hollow Knight: Silksong mod, which can improve the experience considerably, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/55?tab=description">All Enemies Drop Rosary Beads</a>, which does exactly what its name suggests, making every enemy in the game drop Rosary Beads when defeated, instead of just the few enemies in the vanilla game. The formula used to calculate how many Beads an enemy drops is based on the extra bead = floor(max health / 5), which some are finding to be a little too much, but if you don't care about breaking the in-game's economy, this is a very useful mod to install.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlaYStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo doesn't really need to create new franchises, a former developer has said, explaining that the company can simply wrap its fresh gameplay ideas into one of the many beloved video game series it owns already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, programmer Ken Watanabe said Nintendo doesn't "really fuss over" which of its big franchises a fun new gameplay mechanic might end up in. And, with so many existing series to chose from, there's little need to come up with more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"New franchises haven't come out simply because there's no real need to make them," Watanabe said. "When Nintendo wants to do something new, it's basically about the gameplay mechanics first — about creating a new way to play."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At Nintendo, Watanabe worked on Super Mario Bros. Wii, Pikmin 3 and Splatoon — one of the company's biggest new franchises of its modern era. But even the first Splatoon is now a decade old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for the skin or the wrapper, they don't really fuss over it," Watanabe continued. "They just pick whatever fits that new gameplay best."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's long list of existing IP certainly seems expansive and beloved enough to support this. Why make a new spaceship combat series when it's been years since the last Star Fox? Why create a fresh arcade racer when you could make a new F-Zero? (Though, let's be real, Nintendo is never making a new,  fully fledged F-Zero.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Nintendo Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo already has most genres covered, and existing fans waiting with baited breath for the next entries in series such as Animal Crossing, Pikmin and Fire Emblem. It makes sense that, if Nintendo did have new gameplay ideas for existing genres, it could just co-opt one of its existing series too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, for example, which Nintendo has described as "the first Splatoon series spin-off." It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-just-announced-splatoon-raiders-for-switch-2-with-a-trailer-exclusive-to-the-nintendo-today-app">looks set to focus on a specific hero character and potentially feature more adventure-led gameplay than its quick-fire shooting predecessors</a>. Could this have been a new IP instead? Maybe, but spinning it off from the hugely popular Splatoon means it instantly appeals to an existing fanbase and has better brand recognition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo hasn't completely ditched the idea of new franchises, of course — though it's fair to say that the company tests fewer new IPs now than it once did. Nintendo's most recent new idea was the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">Drag x Drive</a>, its wheelchair basketball game that utilised the Switch 2's motion controls. It's hard to see how that could have fitted into an existing franchise — though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">maybe plonking Mario and friends into its arenas might have helped</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But, he thinks its popularity might have influenced some decisions made in Hollywood, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/david-ellison-top-gun-star-trek-1236343043/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250814" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> said Paramount had three franchises it planned to prioritize when it came to movies: Top Gun 3, Star Trek, and World War Z. World War Z was the biggest surprise here, given it’s been over a decade since the movie came out. So why is Paramount interested in making a follow-up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Saber’s World War Z. Willits said it was his feeling (he hasn’t been told this is the case in an official capacity) that the enduring success of the World War Z video game over the last six years has directly contributed to Paramount’s desire to revive the franchise in movie terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“30 million people have played that game. Isn't that crazy? 30 million unique people,” Willits began. “They have not told me this — I'll probably get in trouble! — they have not told me this, but maybe IGN put this on Instagram, that there's talk at Paramount about making another World War Z. Again, they have not told me this, but I'm pretty sure it’s because of that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They have not told me this. I'm guessing!” Willits continued. “30 million people. That's f***ing ridiculous! I saw that [the Paramount news] and I was like, ‘Oh that’s gotta be us.’”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Zombie Movies</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first time an effort to make World War Z 2 was started. World War Z was a commercial success upon its release in 2013, grossing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/world-war-z-is-brad-pitts-highest-grossing-film">over $540 million worldwide at the box office</a> (it was Pitt's highest-grossing film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-is-brad-pitts-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-overtaking-world-war-z">before the recently released F1 movie overtook it</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount confirmed its plans to make a sequel shortly after, but planning turned patchy after Marc Foster, director of the first film, announced that he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/06/paramount-halts-preproduction-on-world-war-z-sequel">would not be returning to helm</a> the second feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a further shake-up that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/david-fincher-reportedly-closing-in-on-directing-world-war-z-sequel">resulted in David Fincher signing on</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/world-war-z-sequel-loses-director-bayona">J.A. Bayona's replacement</a> in the director's chair. However, the sequel never pulled together as Paramount decided to halt pre-production in 2019, reportedly due to budget issues and a lack of momentum, even though production was supposed to begin that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/david-fincher-cancelled-world-war-z-sequel-a-little-like-the-last-of-us">Fincher likened his scrapped World War Z sequel to HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation</a>, saying he was glad his movie didn't make it beyond pre-production. Fincher told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/david-fincher-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> that there were some notable similarities between his Brad Pitt-fronted follow-up film to World War Z and the HBO adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, so much so that he was left feeling happy his project never came together because he felt the other had "more real estate" to tackle the same topics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was a little like The Last of Us," Fincher said, teasing what he had planned for the World War Z sequel. "I'm glad that we didn't do what we were doing because The Last of Us has a lot more real estate to explore the same stuff. In our title sequence, we were going to use the little parasite... they used it in their title sequence and in that wonderful opening with the Dick Cavett, David Frost-style talk show."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/gettyimages-526328424-1757318690970.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will Brad Pitt return for World War Z 2?

Meanwhile, any new World War Z movie would clearly benefit Saber’s game, and perhaps spark a conversation about a video game sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not supposed to say anything, but we have cool stuff to talk about in that game in the future,” is all Willits would tease about World War Z.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more from our interview with Willits, including his comments on how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-says-a-large-chunk-of-fans-have-assumptions-about-the-warhammer-40000-universe-that-are-not-correct-as-a-result-of-the-huge-success-of-the-game">a large chunk of fans have “assumptions” about the Warhammer 40,000 universe that are incorrect as a result of the huge success of the game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delaying-space-marine-2-was-the-smartest-thing-we-ever-did-saber-reflects-on-the-biggest-warhammer-40000-game-of-all-time-after-a-year-of-dlc-and-looks-to-the-future"><u>why delaying Space Marine 2 was the best thing Saber ever did</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing">vague excitement about Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lars Niki/Corbis via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>"Defendant’s conduct has caused NOA significant and irreparable harm"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd095a686ee4e/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has won yet another lawsuit in its ongoing battle against piracy on the Switch and Switch 2, this time against 'MiG Switch' distributor Ryan Daly and the Modded Hardware website.</p>
<p>Updated on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>, the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">court document</a> confirms that Daly is required to pay Nintendo a total of $2 million in damages (thanks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-wins-a-2-million-lawsuit-against-popular-switch-modding-webstore-174528989.html">Engadget</a>). In addition, a permanent injunction has been entered against Daly, preventing him from engaging in any activities that might be linked to the selling, marketing, or promotion of piracy devices such as the 'MiG Switch' and 'MiG Dumper'.</p>
<p>The injunction goes so far as to prevent Daly from accessing any device that may be hacked or in some way tampered with to circumvent Nintendo's protective measures. The Modded Hardware website has also been shut down, and Daly has been ordered to surrender all relevant website domains to Nintendo that may include company-owned content.</p>
<p>A key segment of the document reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defendant’s conduct has caused NOA significant and irreparable harm. For example, the MIG Devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services allow members of the public to create, distribute, and play pirated Nintendo games on a massive scale. Thus, the MIG devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services harm NOA's goodwill, detract from NOA's consumer base, and enable widespread illegal and difficult to detect copying."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a pretty comprehensive win for Nintendo, and comes after it was reported that Switch consoles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-might-want-to-be-careful-buying-pre-owned-switch-1-games-for-your-switch-2">could effectively be 'bricked'</a> if discovered to be accessing pirated content, causing quite a kerfuffle for second-hand buyers.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been relentless in its pursuit against piracy in recent years, with a major Switch ROM Site – 'nsw2u' – being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/the-fbi-has-seized-a-switch-rom-site-as-part-of-a-law-enforcement-operation">seized by the FBI</a> as part of a 'law enforcement operation', while also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-has-seemingly-taken-possession-of-the-ryujinx-switch-emulator-website">taking full possession of the 'Ryujinx' ROM site</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is not precisely a puzzle-heavy survival horror game, but that doesn't mean that you won't have to collect and place items correctly or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-whats-the-passcode-for-the-storeroom-lock/">discover passcodes</a> to open up locked doors. In most cases, doors locked with passcodes are not mandatory to unlock to proceed in the main mission, but they should still be opened to obtain always-needed resources and additional items that can be used to solve puzzles, which unlock new weapons when completed.</p>



<p>This is the case of the <strong>locked door found in the Hospital Director's room</strong>. The first time you encounter this room will be while The Traveler has to explore Unity Hospital to obtain three samples to synthesize the Biomass Dissolving Toxin. No sample is hidden inside this room, but you will still want to open it to <strong>get an item required to complete the Chapel's puzzle located near the main save point on the first floor of the Hospital.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To discover the passcode</strong>, you must proceed in the same wing as the Director's Room until you reach a massive room with a lot of Biomass. From this room's entrance, head to the left until you reach <strong>a blocked door on your left, and a crouching point in front of you</strong>. Press the X or B button to enter a new area and then turn to the left where you will find a window with a broken window looking into the locked room. Shoot the gas can to burn the Biomass blocking the door to be able to enter the room, grab every item, and check the document, which will tell you the locked room passcode: <strong>9509</strong>. You can also input the passcode directly without discovering the document first, in case you are not in the mood for some exploration.</p>

<p>Inside the room, you will find some resources as well as the Chalice, which can be used to complete the aforementioned Chapel puzzle and, in turn, obtain the Mace JER-5120 shotgun, a modified variant of the regular Hammer shotgun which trades charged shots with a powerful double shot.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox have gotten the ball rolling on the "adjustments" they promised in response to the controversy over the game's day-one paid DLC vampire clans.</p>
<p>As we've covered previously, the Toreador and Lasombra clans were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">originally revealed</a> to be locked behind a purchase of either Bloodines' £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 Shadows and Silk DLC pack, or the £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 premium edition that said DLC comes bundled with. Cue understandable unhappiness, and Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-making-adjustments-to-bloodlines-2s-day-one-vampire-clan-dlc-plans-following-backlash">swiftly moving to declare they'd rejig some stuff before launch</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first domino's now fallen, and it's refunds for PlayStation pre-orderers. "Anyone who pre-ordered the premium edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday, September 8th," World of Darkness community developer DebbieElla announced on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554580174864384001/1115895131573342279/1413574860512170158">Bloodlines 2 Discord</a>. "You will be able to pre-order your premium edition copy again later, before the release on October 21st."</p>
<p>The good news for us PC folks is that Paradox made clear this is just an "intentional first step" in their planned tweaks following the backlash. "We are working hard on the adjustments that we promised, and we will be able to tell you all the details on September 17th," DebbieElla wrote. "Making significant changes like this involves many moving parts, and we want to make sure that we get it right with this change."</p><p>So, a little longer to wait for info as to whether there'll be changes to the DLC/editions and their pricing on PC. However, pulling existing pre-orders and then requesting folks make them again points towards a premium edition price drop being at least one of the measures Paradox are taking. Any change might make paying extra for the two clans a bit more palatable, but unless the premium edition's brought down to match the price of the base game, dishing the DLC clans out at no extra cost, odds are the sour taste won't come close to being washed away.</p>
<p>Paradox and Bloodlines developers The Chinese Room previously defended charging for Toreador and Lasombra vamps when our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">asked them about the decision at Gamescom</a>, citing the game's changing scope.</p>
<p>"We have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it," Bloodlines 2 narrative director Ian Thomas said.</p>
<p>We'll keep you in the loop as to what Paradox announce on the 17th, and keep on hoping that Bloodlines 2 will stop all this Sideshow Bob rake-stepping as it tries to position itself as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">"spiritual successor" to Bloodlines</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like many modern games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> hardly ends when the main campaign is completed. After experiencing one of the two endings and seeing the credits roll, a couple of new play modes are unlocked - <strong>New Game Plus and Hard Mode.</strong> While at a glance, Hard Mode may have more to offer to those who mastered the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">core mechanics</a>, <strong>New Game Plus may be more worthwhile to go through</strong>, as it provides something to those who have enjoyed the game's story.</p>



<p>Regarding gameplay differences, New Game Plus mode in Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't offer much. <strong>Item and enemy placement will be the same as in the first playthrough</strong>, so you should be able to breeze through this mode with relative ease, considering you will<strong> keep every upgrade unlocked during your first playthrough</strong>. As such, playing the game again in New Game Plus mode is the only way to <strong>unlock some of the Trophies and Achievements</strong>, including the May It Serve You Fault-Free achievement for fully upgrading a single weapon, The Praetorian for fully upgrading every weapon, and Forged In Fire for fully upgrading the Temporal Shell.</p>



<p><em><strong>SPOILER ALERT - Avoid reading below the screenshot if you haven't completed the game, as there are plenty of spoilers ahead regarding late-game beats and endings.</strong></em></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn New Game Plus mode has a lot to offer to those who enjoyed the game's storyu</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, even if you aren't a Trophy or Achievement hunter, you will have a very good reason to complete Cronos: The New Dawn's New Game Plus mode if you have loved the game's story. After defeating The Pathfinder on the Clocktower at the end of the game, you will be presented with<strong> three choices</strong> instead of two, and by picking the <strong>Begin Anew</strong> choice, you will unlock <strong>Ending C</strong>, which is, possibly, the most hopeful ending of the three, and one that all those who liked the story will surely appreciate.</p>

            <p>
A sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> could be on the cards if the forthcoming remake sells well, its director has teased.
</p>
<p>
The PS1 tactical RPG was first released in 1997, and while it established the world of Ivalice that reappeared in subsequent games, it never received a direct sequel. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> also released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics-advance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a> games on GBA and DS, though the second of these was back in 2007.
</p>
<p>
"If The Ivalice Chronicles can do well, that's good for the fans, they can enjoy it. But, at the same time, it shows the business viability of the strategy RPG genre," Kazutoyo Maehiro, director of the remake told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">Inverse</a>. "So that could potentially open the door for doing something with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance or A2, or maybe even sequels and new titles as well. I think I speak for everyone who's worked on the original Final Fantasy Tactics, and is working on The Ivalice Chronicles as well - we'd really like to see that happen."

<p>
Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the most beloved entries in the series, praised for its mature, political storytelling. Fans have long-wanted a new Tactics game, with this remake being rumoured for years.
</p>
<p>
Maehiro also commented on the popularity of the genre overall, alluding to other recent turn-based games.
</p>
<p>
"Of course, with the different hardware advances that have come, we see a lot more action games," he said. "But I think, at the same time, that doesn't really mean turn-based or strategy games went away. They've advanced with the hardware advances. I know we have titles that might start with P or have 33 in them, and fans really enjoy these games.
</p>
<p>
"But strategy RPGs are opportunities where people need to be able to think and strategise to excel at these games. And people do enjoy them overall - so these games have a place."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-difficulty-tweaks-new-features-preserving-a-seminal-magic">hands-on with Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, and discussed with the developers the need for a remake.
</p>
<p>
"Obviously, this game came out 28 years ago," said co-director Ayako Yokoyama. "But the story is amazing, and I think that's something we want people to experience. At the same time it is a strategy RPG, and maybe for more casual players that's a little bit of a hurdle. It can even be hard for people who aren't used to that type of game, but do like story-based RPGs."
</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles releases on 30th September across Xbox, PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC (Steam).</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-requirements-accessible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-official-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-pc-requirements-are-quite-accessible.1291221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With only about a month and a half before the game's launch, developer The Chinese Room and publisher Paradox Interactive have shared the official PC requirements for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-qa-lot-subtleties-to-movement-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> on the store pages where players can pre-order the game.</p>



<p>Bloodlines 2 is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5. However, the game does not boast any particularly advanced technology like ray tracing, and indeed, the stated minimum and recommended requirements won't be a problem for most gamers, and the game doesn't require much hard drive space, either.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)<br>Processor: Intel Core i3-8350K | AMD Ryzen 3 3300X<br>Memory: 8 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) | AMD Radeon RX 480 (8GB) | Intel Arc A580 (8GB, Resizable BAR enabled) | AMD Radeon 780M<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 30 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-12600K | AMD Ryzen 5 5600X<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (8GB) | AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT (12GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 30 GB available space</p>



<p>Still, we do not know the intended target resolution, frame rate, and graphics preset for the minimum and recommended specs. Moreover, during <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my recent test of a preview build</a>, I could not help but notice that the dreadful Unreal Engine traversal stuttering was indeed present.</p>



<p>I said as much to the developers of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 when I met them at Gamescom 2025. Hopefully, they can do something to alleviate those issues, making the experience smoother on PC. It is not impossible - a few Unreal Engine games do not suffer as much stuttering as the others, Silent Hill f being one example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Digital Foundry pre-release test</a>.</p>



<p>In other Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 news, the Community Manager revealed a small update regarding the promised <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweaks for the Premium Edition and day-one Silk &amp; Song paid DLC</a>. The news will be shared on Wednesday, September 17; meanwhile, PlayStation users who had pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store have been refunded. </p>

<p>As part of a recent 'The Making of Wolfenstein' documentary by Noclip, Gustafsson said MachineGames had always pictured a trilogy of Wolfenstein games to wrap up the story of BJ, or to give him his proper title - Terror-Billy, the scourge of the Nazi empire.</p>

<p>"That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-indiana-jones-it-sounds-like-machinegames-is-ready-to-make-another-wolfenstein-game-we-have-always-seen-this-as-a-trilogy/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet.</p>
<p>"We have a story to tell."</p>
<p>Is this something you would hope to see realised? You can check out the full Noclip video about the making of Wolfenstein below.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World / Cronos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2451eae3d418c/mario-kart-world-cronos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Happy Monday, folks! The latest UK boxed charts are here, and we've got a few newcomers to acknowledge, but first... Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is back in the lead at number 1. Nintendo's grabbed a Golden Mushroom and stormed past the competition once again; let's see how long it lasts this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> makes a solid debut at number 4, just behind <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metal_gear_solid_delta_snake_eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>. That said, physical sales were mostly attributed to the PS5, which made up 83% of the platform split. PC managed 9%, and Switch 2 8%.</p>
<p>Not a surprising outcome, to be honest, as the PS5 is a good home for horror, and the Game-Key Card format might not be doing Switch 2 sales any favours. Having said that, it also seems very key retailers have it listed for the Switch 2, which perhaps implies a limited distribution.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> returned to the top ten thanks to the new Switch 2 release, coming in at number 7. Physical sales on the console made up 75% of the platform split, with PS5 and Xbox making up the remaining 18% and 7% respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> saw a slightly more muted response, coming in at number 15. PS5 took the lead here too with 62% of the split, while Switch 2 managed 38%. Finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> really didn't make much of a splash, coming in at number 24. Switch 2 took the lead here with 72% of the split, with PS5 taking 24%, and Xbox 4%.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Bethesda Head of Publishing and Communication Pete Hines was recently featured <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">in an interview with Dbltap</a>, which included a rather harsh criticism of subscription services like Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Hines opined that, at least as far as he knew before <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-pete-hines-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving Bethesda in October 2023</a>, content makers weren't being properly rewarded when their games were added to these subscription services. </p>



<p><em>I'm not working in any of these companies anymore, and so I don't assume that everything I knew while I was in the industry still holds true today. At the same time, I'm involved enough to know I saw what I considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said. Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content – without which your subscription is worth jack shit – then you have a real problem. You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product. That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.</em></p>



<p>Hines, who obviously had experience with Game Pass (Bethesda was bought by Xbox a couple of years before he left the company and immediately started putting games on Microsoft's gaming subscription service), was backed in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brief LinkedIn message</a> by former Xbox executive Shannon Loftis, who spent nearly 30 years at Microsoft and was most recently VP of Xbox Game Studios before leaving the company in June 2022. Here's what she said:</p>



<p><em>As a longtime first-party Xbox developer, I can attest that Pete is correct. While Game Pass can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves (Human Fall Flat, e.g.), the majority of game adoption on Game Pass comes at the expense of retail revenue unless the game is engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization. I could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates.</em></p>



<p>After some stagnation, though, subscription services spending grew significantly in June 2025 in the US, registering a record month with $562 million, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37olha22k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Circana's Senior Director Mat Piscatella</a>. Of course, that doesn't mean that the game developers and publishers who provided the games have been adequately rewarded. Still, it does mean that the likes of Microsoft and Sony will continue seeking to invest in the business model.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the aforementioned interview, Pete Hines revealed that his biggest regret while at Bethesda was the Fallout 76 Collector's Edition snafu. As you might recall, it was supposed to include a canvas bag, but it was replaced at the last minute with a cheaper nylon bag, leading to fans' outrage. At first, users <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-millions-playing-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were only given 500 Atoms for compensation</a>, and Hines himself did not push to replace the nylon bag with the promised canvas bag as soon as possible. Eventually, though, he realized the mistake, and the canvas bag was sent to those who had ordered that edition.</p>

                <p>Two years ago this week, Bethesda's interstellar action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">Starfield</a> debuted on Xbox Series X|S and PC. The first major expansion, Shattered Space, was released in September 2024. Now, a new expansion may be on the horizon. Bethesda's official Starfield social media account shared an anniversary message for fans that appears to include what may be the name of the next DLC.</p><p>If that went by too fast for you to catch all of the letters, the two words appear to be "Terran Armada."</p><p>The name Terran Armada suggests a faction with direct links to Earth. In the lore of Starfield, Earth became uninhabitable, which led to humanity's colonization of other star systems. Humans haven't had many reasons to go back to their home world since, but perhaps that will change.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Starfield lead creative producer Tim Lab <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/" data-ref-id="1100-6534318">confirmed that there will be a new expansion</a> while sharing some additional information.</p><p>"We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story," said Lab. "I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights."</p><p>There have also been persistent rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-could-come-to-ps5-next-spring-report/1100-6533651/" data-ref-id="1100-6533651">Starfield may come to PlayStation 5</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-leaker-claims/1100-6534121/" data-ref-id="1100-6534121">even to Nintendo Switch 2</a> in the future. For now, those reports remain unconfirmed.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
