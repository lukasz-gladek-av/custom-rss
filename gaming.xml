		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield</a>: Shattered Space has been revealed, the first big story expansion for Bethesda’s sci-fi RPG. Shattered Space will launch later this year for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

<p>There’s some decidedly spooky vibes to the DLC and trailer, with a mysterious power stirring hte city of Dazra on House Va-runn’s hidden homeworld – this will be a big new area to explore akin to the other capital planets in the base game. Here you’ll investigate a new cosmic threat, explore a brand new planet and find new weapons, spacesuits, and gear.</p>

		<p>COD: Black Ops 6 is coming out on 25th October, and will remain a cross-generation release across PS5 and PS4, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, and PC. It will also launch straight into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Ops 6 - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyZY_BiTmd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game leans into all of the usual tropes and expectations of Black Ops series, with double crossing subterfuge and more, set in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. George HW Bush is President, and there’s lies and more afoot.</p>
<p>The game is getting its big reveal in the Black Ops 6 Direct, following the Xbox Games Showcase. The Direct will show off multiplayer and Zombies.</p>
<p>Phil Spencer has announced that there will be no more timed exclusive content, ending the PlayStation marketing collaboration between Activision and Sony after a decade.</p>

<p>In the last hour, it had seemed that Sony had leaked the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-releasing-october-17-will-be-cross-gen.895209/">Black Ops 6 release date for 17th October on the PlayStation Store</a>. It’s not clear if that’s an early access window for pre-orders, mistaken information, or if Microsoft made a very last second change. We’ll update this post when we have more information.</p>

            <p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard got a first trailer today during the Xbox Showcase, and it looked very good indeed. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare's RPG has a slightly stylised artstyle - in this trailer, at least - and a cool-looking roster of new companion characters... except not all of them are new. 
</p>
<p>
In amongst the roster are a couple of familiar faces. Varric we knew would be back in this next installment. But also joining the party... Dragon Age Inquisition fan-favourite Harding! This news makes this particular Dragon Age fan extremely happy indeed.
</p>

We're expecting to see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-dragon-age-dreadwolf-name-change-gameplay-reveal">15 minutes of gameplay footage from Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> this coming week. Check back on Tuesday for more.

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More Doom: The Dark Ages details will be added soon. </em></p>
<p>It’s time to go medieval on some demon asses. Over the past few weeks, rumors emerged that a reveal for the next entry in the Doom series was imminent, and today at the<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Microsoft and id Software revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. They also revealed a [x] release date for the game.</p>
<p>As the title implies, Doom: The Dark Ages is taking a full-on fantasy approach. We seem to be playing a s new version of the Doomslayer, or at least one decked out in a medieval tinged suit of armor. It looks like one of the big new mechanics now is a chainsaw shield, which can be used to block enemy attacks, as well as shred unfortunate demons. We also get a peek at a weapon that uses skulls for ammo, a dragon mount, a giant medieval mech, and more. You can check out the first trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S according to the new trailer, although an PS5 release is also likely. The game arrives sometime in 2025. What do you think? Ready to rip and tear all over again? Or is this latest Doom missing something?</p>

  <p id="3Sz08B">Announced during Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is id Software’s next foray back into hell. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a medieval spin on the Doom franchise, taking the Doom Slayer back to the beginning. It’s coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, sometime in 2025.</p>
<p id="a3uHvR">Microsoft’s first trailer for <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> shows the frenetic, precision gameplay we’ve come to expect from the franchise — there’s a lot of blasting and shooting <em>and</em> a chainsaw. Oh, and the Doom Slayer can ride a dragon? </p>
<p id="U7MvGY">Sunday’s announcement is the first official news of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages,</em> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/">following an Insider Gaming report from May</a>. Bethesda Softworks and id Software released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/17/21225011/doom-eternal-flow-state-fun-zone-hugo-martin-jenova-chen"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a> in 2020. Launching alongside <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, <em>Doom Eternal </em>was a major hit. The game sold three million digital copies in its release month, <a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market">according to sales numbers from Superdata</a>. That’s three times the number of copies 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/18/11706108/doom-review-PC-xbox-one-PS4"><em>Doom</em></a> sold in its first month, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/animal-crossing-new-horizons-broke-record-for-most-digital-units-sold-in-a-single-month">per GamesIndustry.biz</a>. id Software released two pieces of DLC for <em>Doom Eternal</em>: <em>The Ancient Gods: Part One</em> and <em>The Ancient Gods: Part Two</em>.</p>
<p id="8qqq8b">In 2021, ahead of <em>The Ancient Gods: Part Two</em>, <em>Doom Eternal </em>game director Hugo Martin <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22333698/doom-eternal-dlc-ancient-gods-part-2-sequels">spoke to Polygon about the future of the series</a> — perhaps hinting at the medieval setting: “Could we tell a story about when [the Doom Slayer] first came to that place with the Sentinels, almost like a more medieval setting, a fantasy setting?” Martin said. “I think as you play the DLC, too, you’ll see lots of hints of what we could do moving forward. Maybe even in the future. Again, our hero is somewhat timeless — I mean, literally, he’s immortal. So we could tell all kinds of stories.”</p>

Microsoft’s very own Xbox store seemingly leaked the release date ahead of the Xbox Games Showcase, in which Activision will detail the upcoming game in its own showcase. The company’s already confirmed that <em>Black Ops 6</em> will come to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">Game Pass on its launch day in October</a>.</p>
<p id="nXZeeu">The $69.99 version up for pre-order on the Xbox store will include access to an open beta period, as well as extra skins. It’s also a cross-generation bundle, meaning it includes versions for Xbox One and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p id="Nxh7Eq"><em>Black Ops 6</em> is developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, and set in the ’90s — Activision describes it as a “spy action thriller” in an era “characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower,” according to the store listing. Naturally, <em>Black Ops 6</em> will launch with a multiplayer mode that has 16 maps and its popular zombies mode, which lets players take on hordes of the undead.</p>
<p id="LEC3PD"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops </em>6 will come to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on Oct. 25. Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get access on Windows PC and console on launch day.</p>

<p>Starfield was released in September 2023 to a mixed reception. Following more than a decade of development, Starfield – which was poised to be one of the best games ever made – failed to hit the mark with many fans worldwide, but that hasn’t stopped Bethesda Game Studios from pouring updates into the ecosystem of this epic space-faring RPG.</p>



<p>For months, fans have eagerly awaited news of the game’s first major expansion: Shattered Space. It has been on the cards since before Starfield was even released, but it’s only now that Bethesda has given the major piece of DLC a solid trailer – but there’s no release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shattered-space-is-coming">Shattered Space is Coming</h2>



<p>During the recent Xbox Games Showcase, it was confirmed that Shattered Space is coming to Starfield in 2024 – but no date more specific than that was given.</p>



<p>As we thought, the DLC is centred around House Va’ruun and The Great Serpent, with players being transported to mystical, cult-themed worlds in search of the origin of a mystery that’ll challenge the very foundation of the universe.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer for Shattered Space:</p>

<p>It was also revealed that more content is coming to Starfield <strong>TODAY</strong>, including Creation Club content and expanded bounty hunter missions, amongst other things.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming but we finally have our first glimpse of the upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard in a brand-new trailer revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase. In it, we receive a whole lot of story details, new and returning characters, and even a release window.</p>



<hr>



<p>For now, check out the new Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailer. It’s definitely worth a watch, or three if you’re a long-time fan of the series. </p>

<p>It has been four years since the last State of Decay 3 trailer was released – and for the most part, the fans eager to receive some more information have all but given up hope. Until now, that is.</p>



<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, Undead Labs revealed another trailer for State of Decay 3, sending the crowd wild for another installation of this open-world, post-apocalyptic sandbox series. It has already been six years since the last State of Decay title, and more than a decade since the first game surfaced – but finally, we have another glimpse at what’s coming next in State of Decay 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-took-long-enough">That Took Long Enough</h2>



<p>State of Decay 3 may have received a lengthy trailer in 2020, but it didn’t give too much away. That’s where the new trailer is different, as Undead Labs took this opportunity to reveal plenty about the upcoming zombie-themed epic.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer for State of Decay 3:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="State of Decay 3 - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OjL3a5ZOFNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s a fairly emotional trailer but it showcases the classic elements we’ve come to expect from State of Decay. There’s plenty of zombie-slaying action that unfolds, but we also get a glimpse at how team mechanics and survivors will function in the game. There’s a juicy look at some new mutated variants and a flash of the environment, and it all looks unmistakably <strong>State of Decay</strong>.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard has taken to the stage during the Call of Duty showcase to reveal Black Ops 6, and the campaign trailer is a whopper that’s sending COD fans worldwide into a frenzy. For months, leaks have been making their way out suggesting that Black Ops 6 will be the most finely-crafted Call of Duty title in years, with Treyarch and Raven Software pouring effort into ticking all the boxes that the community typically puts forward.</p>



<p>In the all-new trailer that showcases this year’s Call of Duty game, we get a glimpse of the spy-thriller-themed campaign that features an electrifying story and a roster of recognisable characters. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-is-coming-october-25">Black Ops 6 is Coming October 25</h2>



<p>Not only did the Black Ops 6 campaign trailer show exactly where (and when) we’re headed in this year’s Call of Duty title, but it also revealed the most important detail for fans: the release date.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25th, and it’s dropping day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>In the trailer released during the Call of Duty showcase, it was shown that players will explore a new portion of the Black Ops universe set in the 1990s, after the end of the Cold War. It’s based in and around the Gulf War, and it features deep and gritty storylines focused on the conspiracies of the age – which is the true nature of Black Ops.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer for your perusal:</p>

<p>Ahead of the full reveal of Black Ops 6 today, images have started surfacing online on digital storefronts such as Battlenet and Steam, revealing the core feel and aesthetic of the upcoming Call of Duty title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-movement-is-life">Movement is Life</h2>



<p>In one key image that’s circulating online, we get a key glimpse at the immense movement mechanics that have been teased (and leaked) for Black Ops 6. In this one shot, we see one player diving dramatically through the air over a pool while another player slides towards them, wielding an assault rifle with a single arm. It’s worth stressing that the player doing the diving is firing their weapon at the same time, giving credence to the claim that Black Ops 6 will feature ‘Max Payne-like’ movement.</p>



<p>In another image, we get a closer look at the game’s campaign:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-300-gb-install-size/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier today, Black Ops 6’s listing appeared early on the Xbox store, revealing the game’s base description and some key information – including the ‘approximate size’ of the upcoming title. It was stated that it would be ‘309.8 GB’ in size, but there’s a good reason for that. It’s almost certainly referring to the full installation required for COD HQ – which includes other content like Call of Duty Warzone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-panic">Don’t Panic</h2>



<p>At first blush, it seems like par for the course for Call of Duty. As time has progressed, the series has swollen dramatically, with some titles swallowing up vast gulfs of storage, effectively wiping out some older consoles with smaller stock hard drives. </p>



<p>Here’s the reference to the size approximation of Black Ops 6:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is one of the leading reasons why gamers aren’t happy with COD HQ as a function – it’s bloated and requires players to install ‘more than they need’, despite Activision Blizzard and associated studios insisting it’s a measure of convenience having all your Call of Duty content in a single place.</p>



<p>Regardless, we can expect that Black Ops 6 will be a fair size. It was shown by the Xbox store listing that there will be 16 maps available at launch, plus a sizeable Zombies offering, and an immersive and expansive single-player campaign featuring ‘spy thriller’ action sequences.</p>



<p>Will you have enough storage space for Black Ops 6?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/09/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-and-it-hits-playstation-xbox-and-pc-next-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer ID Software's modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>As you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Id Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/doom/b/playstation4/archive/2016/05/17/doom-review.aspx"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Doom review</a>. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/doom-eternal/doom-eternal-review-bloody-brilliant#:~:text=In%20this%20direct%20continuation%20to,is%20a%20spectacle%20to%20behold."><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Doom Eternal review</a> to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-acquires-bethesda-the-studio-behind-fallout-the-elder-scrolls-doom-and-more">Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media</a> in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/09/xbox-confirms-some-bethesda-titles-will-be-exclusive-but-not-all">how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions</a>, including whether future Doom, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">Call of Duty</a>, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="339" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Bethesda and Microsoft officially announced the next <em>Fallout 76</em> expansion, <em>Skyline Valley</em>. Players will head to the Shenandoah region to investigate a strange electrical storm and delve into the mystery of Vault 63 and its inhabitants including a Ghoul type called The Lost. The expansion launches on all platforms this Wednesday, June 12.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yHLtDrbLqw </p></figure> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">The trailer showed off the shocking new Shenandoah region, with the massive electrical storm constantly looming overhead. It’s great timing for <em>Fallout 76</em> which has seen a recent resurgence in player numbers due to the wildly popular <em>Fallout</em> show that released on Amazon.</p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">Near the end of the trailer, we also get a glimpse of the new Ghoul type, called The Lost, as well as a teaser that in early 2025 players will actually be able to play as a Ghoul.</p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">I haven’t played <em>Fallout 76</em> since it originally launched and wasn’t too fond of it. However, I’ve heard it’s gotten a ton of love since then is up there with the upper echelons of <em>Fallout</em> goodness in terms of both gameplay and story. This sounds like a great time to jump back in.</p>

            <p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is finally leaving early access, and to celebrate, developer Offworld has confirmed that the sci-fi FPS will also be making the jump to console.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starship-troopers-extermination-gets-early-access-release-date">Starship Troopers: Extermination launched in early access back in May 2023</a>, initially providing just a small sample of the first-person shooter on Steam. Now the game is ready for a full release debut on PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 11th October, 2024.</p>

<p>But that's not the only exciting announcement Offworld had for us. Casper Van Dien – Johnny Rico of the original 1997 Starship Troopers film – will be making a grand return as he will be commanding players during the single-player campaign, "testing their mettle against hordes of enemy Arachnids with the aid of three original NPC allies to prove themselves worthy of selection".</p>
<p>"This new game mode is focused on providing a unique single-player experience. It offers 25 distinct missions and a variety of unique PvE combat scenarios across various environments, and we’re looking to follow up with a second chapter after the 1.0 launch," Offworld explains.</p>
<p>"Additionally, in the coming weeks, We will share more information regarding Starship Troopers: Extermination – including details about the latest update."</p>
<p>If you're interested but haven't yet jumped in, the early access edition is currently available for £25/$30, "a lower price point than it will be when it launches into 1.0".</p>
<p>"So gather some friends, enlist, and work together in the name of the Federation!" the team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/">said</a>. "The battle will be intense but as hardened warriors standing for all of humanity and the United Citizen Federation’s Mobile Infantry, leave no inch of ground safe for the Arachnids!"</p>

<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was released in December 2023 to a mixed reception, emerging as a melting pot of open-world activities set at the heart of the Avatar universe. It failed to land too strong an impression on the global gaming community, securing around average score of around 73 on Metacritic. It wasn’t the worst game ever released by Ubisoft, but for many, it felt like Far Cry with Na’vi.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Ubisoft is bucking a traditional trend and preparing to release Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora on Steam.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pushing-further">Pushing Further</h2>



<p>Many gamers refuse to play Ubisoft games on PC because they’re typically only available in Ubisoft Connect, the company’s proprietary launcher and digital storefront. While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora didn’t launch on Steam when it came out in December 2023, it seems that Ubisoft is preparing to right that wrong in a rare fashion, adding Avatar to Steam on June 17.</p>



<p>This news wasn’t accompanied by an announcement, which suggests Ubisoft might be preparing to say something during the upcoming Ubisoft Forward showcase, which is due to take place on June 10.</p>



<p>Historically, few Ubisoft games have wound up on Valve’s platform, which by numbers and market share is the largest digital storefront and launcher platform on PC. It’s where tens of millions of gamers worldwide log in daily to enjoy their libraries, and despite some integrations and third-party partnerships surfacing in recent years, Ubisoft has failed to jump on the bandwagon in earnest, opting to instead rely almost exclusively on Ubisoft Connect.</p>



<p>It might have taken them six months to get it done, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840770/Avatar_Frontiers_of_Pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Avatar is finally coming to Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 for Game Pass details have finally been confirmed.</p>



<p>The new details went live on the Xbox Store before the official announcement at the Xbox Game Showcase, confirming what you can get for which Game Pass tier.</p>



<p>Both the Xbox Game Pass and Ultimate Game Pass will include the Digital Cross-Gen Edition of Black Ops 6, whereas the PC Game Pass will just include the standard edition. All Game Pass subscribers will gain access to the Woods Operator pack and Early Beta Access.</p>



<p>For those who want to get the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-vault-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vault Edition of Black Ops 6</a>, the Xbox store is listing the game for Game Pass subscribers for an additional one-time fee of $30.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that Black Ops 6, or Call of Duty, will not have its own Game Pass subscription. </p>



<p>Interestingly, nothing has been said on the Xbox Store about any form of Early Access, whereas the PlayStation store has revealed that at least one mode will be available one week early. We’ll have to wait and see what that entails, but if the past games have anything to go by, it could be Campaign Early Access.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Black Ops 6 on Game Pass? Let us know down below!</p>

Only a brief glimpse at the fourth game in the series was shown to fans. However, EA and Full Circle did surprise gamers with a new Skate promo that features I Think You Should Leave star and skateboard enthusiast Tim Robinson in a comedy skit that captures the flavor of his Netflix series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCM3EfAz8FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cCM3EfAz8FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the sketch, Robinson plays Richie Dandle, an executive at M-Corp. The company has apparently rebranded with a friendlier name than its previous incarnation as MongoCorp in the earlier Skate games. Throughout the video, Richie attempts to convince the viewers that there's nothing to the rumors that M-Corp has abandoned San Vansterdam, even as his co-workers desperately attempt to destroy evidence before they flee the office.</p><p>It's only in the last 30 seconds of the video that "pre-pre alpha" footage of Skate shows players turning the entire city of San Vansterdam into a giant skate park. The clip also suggests that it may be possible to add customized touches to the city landscape in addition to the usual round of skateboarding tricks.</p><p>Skate doesn't currently have a release date. But gamers are invited to sign up for console playtesting through <a href="http://skate-game/insider" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skate's official site</a>. The playtesting will begin this fall.</p>

<p>While we didn't get a release date when Devolver Digital made the reveal, we did get to see some gameplay courtesy of a comprehensive, if brief, announcement trailer, which you can see below:</p>

<p>"Step into the shoes of a renegade yakuza hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City in this fast and fluid rogue-jutsu from Sébastien Benard, the designer of Dead Cells," teases the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363940/Tenjutsu/">Steam</a> description.</p>
<p>Tenjutsu blends "roguelike mechanics with intensely fast melee combat and demanding tactical precision" in which you'll get to "wield the brutal brawling systems as if each encounter could be your last and master a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and techniques to break the crushing hold the syndicates come to maintain".</p>
<p>"Tenjutsu is born from a Ludum Dare game jam and the ashes of Dead Cells, despite my desire NOT to make another rogue. Guess what, I'm doing another one," says creator Benard.</p>
<p>"To sum it up, Tenjutsu is what John Wick or Jackie Chan would have been if they were a combat roguelite. An action-packed melee combat system, where you face multiple enemies simultaneously, filled with split-second battle opportunities.</p>
<p>"My idea was to make the combat way more dynamic than in Dead Cells by adding opportunities, combat space management, and crowd control to create true 'one vs. many' situations."</p>
<p>Benard adds that the game will boast "tons of unique weapons, loot, upgrades, and bosses" and allows players to have "control of their path" so you can tackle bosses in whatever order best suits you.</p>
<p>"There’s so much more to talk about – the city evolutions, the enemies, the progression system! – but... no, today is not the time... yet," Benard teased.</p>
<p>Last year, Dead Cells developers Motion Twin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-is-getting-a-ten-episode-animated-series-next-year">revealed</a> its acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer was being turned into a 10-episode animated series, and a first proper trailer has now been shared ahead of its arrival later this month.</p>
<p>Dead Cells: Immortalis (as it's titled in France) has been produced in conjunction with French anime streaming service ADN, and its 10 seven-minute-long episodes will air there on 19th June. An English version and worldwide release is due later this year.</p>

There could be more than 15 first-party Xbox games shown at this year’s showcase, more than in 2023. We might even see one or two Xbox games for PS5.

It’s called <em>Skyline Valley</em>, and for the first time, it will actually expand the game’s map, introducing a new Shenandoah region in the south.

At Xbox’s big June showcase event, id Software officially unveiled the next entry in the demonic shooter series, which is called <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. As the name implies, it takes the franchise back to a medieval-like era, with the slayer killing enemies in a more fantasy realm. In that way, it seems to serve as a prequel of sorts. It still looks as gruesome and gory as ever, though.
