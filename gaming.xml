			<p>Few games live in my head quite like the ones in the Persona series, and among them there is a clear pantheon of greats. Though there are just five main series games, the true number of games is significantly higher thanks to spin-offs and rereleases that are slightly different to the original.&nbsp;Persona 3 Reload is one of those slightly different rereleases, and now it’s been re-rereleased with a Switch 2 port.</p>
<p><iframe title="Persona 3 Reload — Announce Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgpmt-54Rjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back at the start of 2024, I gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">a whopping 9/10</a> for being a completely revamped Persona 3 experience that was the best possible version of the game, though not quite the definitive one thanks to the omission of the playable female main character (FeMC, as she’s known online) from previous iterations.</p>


<p>For those who don’t know it, you play a teenager who is tasked with saving humanity. There’s a lot of adult themes here, including most notably, death and suicide. This game isn’t for everyone, but if after watching the trailer you’re curious, it will almost certainly get its hooks in you. If nothing else, the soundtrack has been playing in my head since last January.</p>
<p>So, how does the Switch 2 edition compare?</p>


<p>To paraphrase the great Igor, who famously resides in a place that exists between mind and matter, dream and reality, this game very firmly sits between the PS4 and PS5 version of the game.</p>
<p>To be clear: this is a carbon copy of last January’s release, scaled to Nintendo’s newest console. There’s no FeMC, but it comes with all the quality of life upgrades that we mentioned in the previous review. This game is incredible — that is not up for debate, you should absolutely play it — but it’s not perfect on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Performance wise, we’re somewhere between the PS4 and PS5 editions of Reload, which is what you’d expect for an anime game locked at 30fps. Is it as pretty as the PS5 version? No, absolutely not. There are issues with frame drops that have been picked up by the community following the demo’s launch, and these have already caught the ear of the developers, including Yoshihiro Komori, who told <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/atlus-to-address-persona-3-reloads-switch-2-frame-rate-hiccups-in-future-patches">Nintendo Life</a> that “We are currently taking steps to improve [the frame rate drops]. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches.”</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help to steady that 30fps down the line, but is it a significant problem for launch?&nbsp; Probably not — this isn’t a photorealistic, high-intensity game. If you’re buying it for the Switch 2, it’s either because you want the portability and convenience, or because you don’t own a more powerful console. If this is a major issue for you, consider getting the game on something more powerful.</p>

<p>Frame rate aside, it actually looks pretty good on the Switch 2. It plays well on handheld and I’ve enjoyed having it on the big screen as well (the same one my PS5 is connected to). Other than some choppy frames during cutscenes, I haven’t really considered turning off the Switch to jump back on the PS5, so that’s a vote of confidence for anyone worried about performance.</p>
<p>This brings us onto the most pertinent question: is it worth buying Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2?</p>
<p>I’d say absolutely, yes, with the caveat that you don’t own a more powerful machine. At this point, it’s going to be cheaper on the PS5 and it frankly looks better. If you don’t own a PS5 and you haven’t already played it, though,&nbsp;I strongly recommend picking up Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2, either now or once a performance patch has arrived.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.</p>

<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159577/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve yet to play any version of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/shin_megami_tensei_persona_3">Persona 3</a>, then its darker tones and subject matter might come as a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>The opening scene shows supporting character Yukari Takeba sitting alone with a gun pointed at her own head, working up the courage to pull the trigger. Even considering some of the directions the subsequent sequels take across their respective narratives, it’s a bold opening statement that sets the tone for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Of course, going back to the original now (or even the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/persona_3_fes">FES</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">Portable</a> releases) might prove difficult if you’re used to the slick presentation and gameplay found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> – so that’s where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> comes in.</p>
<p>Freshly ported over to Switch 2 after launching on other platforms in February 2024, this is a complete remake of the 2006 PS2 entry, featuring revamped visuals, improved gameplay, and a host of quality-of-life updates. While the lack of content from FES and Portable prevents it from being truly definitive, it’s nevertheless the best way to experience the main story.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159580/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of which, Reload sees you transfer to Gekkoukan High School in Tatsumi Port Island, but your arrival reveals that all is not as it seems. A hidden period of time known as the ‘Dark Hour’ occurs every night during which the moon glows green, citizens become encased in coffins, and monstrous ‘Shadow’ creatures stalk a huge tower called Tartarus.</p>
<p>Thankfully, those with the ability to summon Personas can remain conscious during this time, and so it’s not long until the 'Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad' (S.E.E.S.) recruits the protagonist to its cause. Utilising the tried-and-tested ‘Chosen One’ trope, it's revealed that not only are you able to summon a Persona yourself, but you can accumulate multiple at once, swapping between them on the fly according to the situation. <em>"I've never seen this before!"</em> gasps the squad leader.</p>
<p>And so begins Persona 3 Reload’s familiar yet streamlined loop in which you spend the daytime building your social links and strengthening your Personas, while you explore Tartarus and put your skills to the test at night.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159585/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Time passes with each chosen activity, with major story beats occurring once a month during the full moon. Sometimes, progression through Tartarus may be blocked off until you reach these so-called ‘Full Moon Operations’, at which point you’ll need to spend your time elsewhere until you’re able to proceed.</p>
<p>Daytime gameplay is split into morning, afternoon (or after school), and evening. Unless it’s a Sunday, during which you’ll be off school, the afternoon and evening segments are usually when you’ll want to plan out your activities, but don’t stress too much about how to spend your time. Reload gives you ample opportunity to do what you want, whether it be simply hanging out with your friends, playing an online game, or working part-time at the local cafe.</p>
<p>Most activities boost your core stats, so you might feel somewhat overwhelmed at first as you figure out how best to pass your time. Again, you really don’t need to worry about it too much; one way Reload improves upon the original is directly notifying you of available activities via your flip phone, so you don’t have to spend every day tracking what you can and can’t do – it’s mostly spelled out for you.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159584/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s during the day that you really get a good sense of your supporting cast, too. Like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> and 5, Reload boasts an exceptionally likeable set of characters, and they feel greatly fleshed out when compared to the PS2 original – I adore Junpei’s lighthearted nature alongside Mitsuru’s more serious, no-nonsense approach.</p>
<p>It helps, too, that both the English and Japanese voiceover work is equally exceptional. I spent the vast majority of the game with the Japanese cast, simply because it lends the overall setting an air of authenticity, but if you stick with English, you’ll be well catered for.</p>
<p>Dungeon-crawling at night retains some limitations of the original, but key improvements make everything a lot more enjoyable. Each floor of Tartarus is procedurally-generated, with corridors and rooms containing Shadows to fight and items to gather. There’s definitely a sense of repetition as you make your way through — a lot of floors showcase the same visual style — but the frequency at which items crop up keeps things engaging alongside the casual chit-chat between the characters.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159582/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fights can be initiated by either running into a Shadow or swinging your weapon with ‘Y’ to hit them. If you manage the latter, you’ll gain a small advantage at the start of the fight, but if a Shadow happens to run into <em>you</em>, the advantage will be reversed. Encounters will feel pretty familiar if you’ve played Persona 5 Royal, and they remain just as enjoyable and thrilling as ever.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, victory often hinges on your ability to exploit your enemy’s weakness, whether it be fire, ice, wind, and so on. Achieving this grants you another turn, and you can expand it further by immediately shifting play to a teammate, potentially continuing a streak of powerful attacks. Exploiting weaknesses also knocks enemies to the ground, eventually culminating in an ‘all-out attack’ in which your entire squad rushes in to pummel foes in a cloud of chaos.</p>
<p>As you progress, your knowledge of how to approach each battle expands, and you’ll find yourself trying out different strategies depending on the situation. An all-out attack may well deal a fair bit of damage, but also results in your enemy immediately recovering from their knockdown, so it may be more advantageous to keep hitting them with elemental attacks to keep them on the ground.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159583/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether you're locked in battle or chilling in your dorm room, Reload’s presentation remains exceptional throughout. Once again taking a few cues from Royal, this game is simply dripping with style.</p>
<p>Launching into the in-game menu presents a slick animation that looks like you’re being plunged into water, while attack animations during battles are consistently impressive, whether you’re summoning a Persona or slashing your katana around. None of it feels <em>quite</em> as flamboyant as Royal, but the stripped-back nature of the presentation is a lot more in line with the darker tone of Reload's story.</p>
<p>Similarly, the slightly remixed soundtrack is just as memorable now as it was back in the day. Specific tunes play depending on where you are in the game, and they’re simply marvellous. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve started humming the school theme while hopping in the car or cooking a meal – it’s just so catchy and addictive. This soundtrack may be my favourite of the entire series.</p>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159581/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In porting the game over to Switch 2, Atlus has done a pretty great job. Visually, it's stunning whether you’re playing docked or handheld, and loading is kept to an absolute minimum throughout.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback, however, is the 30fps performance. I want to stress that the gameplay here doesn’t suffer; turn-based JRPGs are rarely reliant on super-smooth gameplay, but it’s the principle, y’know? Reload doesn’t feel like it’s pushing the Switch 2 very hard, so I have to wonder why Atlus wasn’t able to achieve a higher frame rate. Perhaps it can be addressed in a future update.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned earlier, it's worth keeping in mind that Reload doesn't feature the expanded content found in Persona 3 FES, nor can you opt for a female protagonist like in Persona 3 Portable. It's true that this is undoubtedly the best way to play the main game, but I wouldn't say that Reload is the absolute definitive version of this entry.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Persona 3 Reload is an extensive and thoughtful remake of the original and unquestionably the best way to experience this modern RPG classic. Switching between daytime and nighttime activities is a blast, and the streamlined gameplay and slick presentation make even the smallest actions feel satisfying.</p>
<p>Minor frustrations remain, chiefly the repetitious nature of Tartarus, while the lack of FES and Portable content prevents Reload from being the definitive version of Persona 3. If this doesn't bother you, though, consider it a must-play on the Switch 2.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/edenspark-gaijin-entertainment-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaijin-entertainments-game-creation-tool-edenspark-goes-all-in-on-ai.1330279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Enlisted&nbsp;</em>studio Gaijin Entertainment has announced EdenSpark, a game creation tool that the company says will "let anyone make games for consoles and share them with the gaming community".</p>

<p>According to a press release, EdenSpark will enter closed beta testing in November, and Gaijin is eyeing a full release sometime next year. The tool aims to give developers access to console development "without a registered company or costly legal paperwork".</p>

<p>Despite its focus on console development, EdenSpark won't launch with full console support; that will be added in fall next year, while the closed beta will give you the opportunity to access "a number of game prototypes". You'll also be able to "upload personal projects" during this time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edenspark-gaijin-entertainment-ai-program.jpg?itok=y45_rG7z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edenspark-gaijin-entertainment-ai-program.jpg?itok=wWC2zzEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EdenSpark will let you build games for consoles using generative AI tools.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this being a modern piece of software, Gaijin has gone all-in on generative AI, and so you can expect a suite of AI assistant tools to help "complete newcomers" create games for the first time.</p>

<p>EdenSpark's generative AI assistant will be able to create "art, sound, and gameplay logic" for you, and Gaijin even says it can "build worlds using plain prompts". If you don't want to bother with that side of things, you can still "dive deep into code" if you wish.</p>

<p>The idea behind EdenSpark is that you'll retain full ownership over any game you make using the tool; you can either keep your creations within EdenSpark's community or release them to the world, but either way, they'll be entirely yours to do with as you please.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for EdenSpark right here. Honestly, I'm very much not sold on the slightly ghoulish AI voiceover; if it's not AI, then whoever performed it is definitely aiming for that uncanny, flat tone, and I don't like it either way. Still, here's the trailer!</p>




<p>Like it or not, generative AI usage is on the rise in the gaming industry. During the most recent Steam Next Fest, more than 500 demos available on the platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" rel="nofollow">disclosed their usage of gen AI</a>, and there may well have been many more that didn't, despite Valve's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-explains-its-rules-on-ai-content-in-steam-games" rel="nofollow">policies</a>.</p>

<p>Gaijin doesn't seem to be accepting closed beta applications for EdenSpark yet, but if you want to keep up with the tool's progress, you can visit the official website <a href="https://edenspark.io/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ball-x-pit-is-a-breakout-hit-with-300k-copies-sold.1330276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Kenny Sun and publisher Devolver Digital have announced that their indie roguelite&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, which marries roguelite-style progression with&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>-esque ball-based chaos, has hit a big sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales just five days after its initial release. As is usually the case, that figure is inclusive of all the platforms on which the game is available, so that's PC, current-gen consoles, and the Switch (with a Switch 2 port on the way later in 2025).</p>

<p>It comes after&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up 100,000 sales for itself in its first 24 hours, which further makes it clear that there's definitely an audience for Sun and Devolver Digital's brand of spherical mayhem. I should know - I'm <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ball-x-pit-review-bubble-bobble-toil-and-trouble" rel="nofollow">part of that audience</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-x-pit-sales-300k-grasslands.jpg?itok=bXAqAI2T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ball-x-pit-sales-300k-grasslands.jpg?itok=FALsOArz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's a roguelite that combines&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>-style ball-batting gameplay with&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque bullet heaven elements, roguelite progression, and base-building. Believe it or not, the combination works pretty well.</p>

<p>The game features a number of different characters, all of whom bring their own gameplay quirks; one character is actually two people who fire their balls in opposing directions, for instance, while another transforms the gameplay into a turn-based tactical affair.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>also has lots of different ball types for you to discover, many of which synergize in ways that provide that sought-after roguelite feeling of "should I really be allowed to do this?".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, which should give you a good sense of the kind of manic visual noise you can expect if you decide to give this one a try (and I heartily recommend that you do), right here.</p>

Your phone, your crummy Android tablet, your car’s infotainment display, oops all Xboxes. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">If Microsoft is right</a> about the future of gaming, your game console might soon be an Xbox even if it’s not an Xbox. It’s an interesting idea, and raises some fascinating questions about the gaming industry. Here’s one of those questions: shouldn’t an Xbox play Xbox games? Here’s another: are they ever going to be any good?</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> begins the show by telling us about his experience with two new Xboxes: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience#:~:text=Xbox%20Ally%20and%20Ally%20X%20review%3A%20this%20is%20not%20an%20Xbox%20">ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X.</a> In a sea of Windows-powered handhelds, these have the official Xbox brand, and thus come with some high expectations. They largely do not meet those expectations. That makes us wonder: is Microsoft’s vision for the future of gaming the correct one? And even if so, can Microsoft pull it off?</p><p>After that, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/hayden-field">Hayden Field</a> joins to discuss a couple of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1">recent</a> controversial <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-critical-thinking-self-reported-reductions-in-cognitive-effort-and-confidence-effects-from-a-survey-of-knowledge-workers/#:~:text=The%20Impact%20of%20Generative%20AI%20on%20Critical%20Thinking%3A%20Self-Reported%20Reductions%20in%20Cognitive%20Effort%20and%20Confidence%20Effects%20From%20a%20Survey%20of%20Knowledge%20Workers%20">studies</a> that seem to be indicating that AI is making us dumber. This sort of concern always appears at the advent of new technologies — people thought the newspaper was the end of civilization, then thought the same about radio and television and a thousand other things besides. Is the AI backlash just another in a series of moral panics, or are we making a cognitive mistake by offloading our brains to chatbots? The science is still nascent, but it’s already interesting.</p><p>Finally, Sean returns to help us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether hybrid computers, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/25/3041280/asus-transformer-pad-review">very 2012 idea</a>, could be the future of computing.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-quietly-launches-fire-sale-star-wars-millennium-falcon-now-selling-for-pennies.1330267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a piece of the Star Wars universe without needing a hangar bay or hyperdrive fuel, this might be your moment: The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary edition) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has just dropped to an all-time low of $67 on Amazon, down from its usual $84 price tag</a>. For fans who’ve spent decades watching Han Solo’s legendary <em>“hunk of junk”</em> outrun Imperial Star Destroyers, this mid-scale collectible brings that iconic vessel right into your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another Lego set that’s going to end up collecting dust in a closet: The <strong>921-piece build provides adult fans with something more</strong>: a moment to quit staring at a screen and immerse themselves in a trance-like building experience that requires several intense hours to complete. The set depicts the Millennium Falcon as it was seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with all of the details that made it so iconic in its debut.</p>
<h2>Unique LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is part of LEGO’s starship collection which is a special line of <strong>mid-scale models designed exclusively for display purposes rather than play</strong>. The completed model stands 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide so it’s massive enough to draw attention on a bookshelf or desk without dominating your available space. The stand that comes with it does more than simply support the ship upright. It’s designed to angle the Falcon dynamically so that it looks as if it’s banked hard on a turn while it makes a daring escape.</p>



<p>The build process itself rewards patience and attention to detail. With 921 pieces, <strong>you’re looking at roughly 4-6 hours of construction time</strong> depending on your experience level. Each section reveals new layers of complexity as you work from the interior framework outward to the iconic hull plating. The cockpit section alone requires careful placement of transparent pieces to recreate those viewport windows, while the external paneling uses clever techniques to achieve the ship’s famously asymmetrical profile. The rotating satellite dish connects through a simple but satisfying mechanism that lets you adjust its position after completion.</p>
<p>This price drop represents genuine value for collectors: The set typically hovers around $84, and previous sales rarely dipped below $75. At $67, you’re getting a premium adult-focused building experience for roughly the cost of a standard mid-range LEGO set. The <strong>4.9-star rating across more than 1,800 reviews</strong> speaks to consistent quality.</p>

              <p>If you’re going to play games on your desktop PC, any old monitor won’t do. Sure, it would be nice to have a massive OLED ultra-wide curved display, but that’s not really necessary either. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/">Samsung has an excellent low budget gaming monitor that’s usually in the couple hundred dollar range, but happens to be on sale right now for as much as 45% off.</a> We’re in a bit of a deals drought between the Amazon Prime Big Deals Days and next month’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so this is a pretty darn good savings for this time of year.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 gaming monitor comes in three different sizes, each on sale. The 24-inch has the steepest discount of 45%. That brings the price down by $90, from $200 down to just $110. Up a level, we have the 27-inch on sale for 35% off. That one usually goes for $230, but has come down by $80 to just $150. Then last we have the larger 32-inch display for 36%. That discount knocks off an even $100, taking the price down from $280 to just $180.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

The 1ms response time feels snappy with minimal blur. Are you struggling with <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s</em> pogo platforming section in Hunter’s March. That might be because you’re screen is making your suffer through some bad input lag.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync support helps keep your GPU and monitor’s refresh rate synchronized. This means less change of screen tearing and a better experience overall both when gaming or when watching a show or movie. You can connect to the monitor over your chose of DisplayPort or HDMI.</p>



<p>Boost the black levels to see all the hidden details lurking in the shadows with the Black Equalizer. This can give you can edge for levels where the lights are out or to make spooky scary games a little less spooky scary.</p>
<p>If you’re been playing for a long while, you can help yourself avoid eye strain. Eye Saver Mode reduces the monitor’s blue light levels which can help relax your eyes. making those longer sessions a bit more comfortable. The stand is tilt adjustable as well so you can have the screen perfectly positioned for your optimal viewing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A video showing a fan assaulting <a href="https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2000637226&amp;action=edit">cosplay livestreamer Emily “Emiru” Schunk at TwitchCon 2025</a> made every online content creator’s worst nightmare go viral. It’s created a new crisis of confidence in Twitch as streamers worry about how seriously the Amazon-owned platform is taking their safety and security. Comments from Twitch’s CEO did little to dispel those concerns.</p> <p>“The safety of our creators is our top priority,” Dan Clancy told Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602">in an interview</a> the day after the incident took place. “The challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.”</p>

 <p>The executive waxed philosophical about community moderation before talking specifically about what happened with Emiru.&nbsp;“I do think that when you’re livestreaming, in many ways, since you control your community and you can ban people, you can make it so that those people that you don’t want engaging with you and participating with you, aren’t there.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I asked Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> getting assaulted at Twitchcon and whether creators can trust the platform to keep them safe. Full interview will be out on my YouTube channel/podcast feed on Wednesday <a href="https://t.co/wTH13vhjBH">pic.twitter.com/wTH13vhjBH</a></p> <p>— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We’re looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi. She’s a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there’s always more work to be done, because that’s the world we live in now.</p></blockquote> <p>But the actions of “leaders in the industry” is not how Emiru has been describing Twitch’s response to the assault at its most recent event. In a video published the same day as the Clancy interview took place, she accused Twitch of lying about its response, claiming the platform’s initial desire was to just ban the alleged suspect for 30 days instead of for life. Emiru also claimed that no one from Twitch security immediately came to her aid or apprehended the suspect to escort him from the show.</p>

 <p>“Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security,” Emiru said. “The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p> <p>The incident has led to renewed warnings about Twitch personalities attending in-person events and even, in some cases, calls for new ownership of Twitch.</p>

<p>If you thought the hype for ARC Raiders couldn’t get any bigger, then you should know how much Embark Studios values its new extraction shooter. A 10-year plan is already drawn up for ARC Raiders, so if you buy the game, expect a lot of content to be fired your way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since an extraction shooter had this much hype and attention. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-early-access-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is taking the spotlight from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov</a>, and the game’s build-up has featured the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Beta</a> and is crescendoing into a big-time release. We’re not sure about you, but if you had any doubts about the future of ARC Raiders, the company has issued a <em>very </em>long-term vision.</p>



<h2 id="h-embark-studios-thinks-arc-raiders-is-a-10-year-game">Embark Studios Thinks ARC Raiders Is A 10-Year Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins—and his team—were asked about what the future holds for ARC Raiders in a sit-down interview. We’re not sure where the original source comes from, but the video credit goes to <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ARCRaidersNews</a> for now.</p>



<p>Watkins had this to say about post-launch content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The design lead doesn’t elaborate on the exact nature of any content or a timeframe, as it can “spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<p>While we know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders isn’t free-to-play and has a price</a>, it should be somewhat comforting to know that the money you part with will supposedly be repaid 3,650 times over.</p>



<div><article><p><span>ARC Raiders’ design director, Virgil, on the game’s post-launch future.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s very bold to proclaim a game will have a 10-year lifecycle of plans and content in this day and age. If ARC Raiders sees a huge drop-off in players within a couple of years, and it doesn’t financially make sense to develop content for a non-existent audience, then those 10-year plans are suddenly under threat.</p>



<p>Should Watkins have said this? Have you been impressed by ARC Raiders enough to think it can sustain itself for at least 10 years?

Veteran developer Marcus Lehto said the game failed to properly credit a number of developers who worked on it.</p><p>The Battlefield 6 credits list off a series of developers from Ridgeline Games, a studio that worked on Battlefield 6's single-player campaign that EA opened and closed in the span of two years. Not everyone from the studio was credited, though, and Lehto said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcus-lehto-7378b31_im-disappointed-to-see-that-many-of-my-former-activity-7386081189645885440-Q38B/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a> that he was "disappointed" by this. Ridgeline helped lay the "foundation" for what Battlefield 6 would become, and everyone who worked on it deserves to be recognized, Lehto said.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a second Direct later this week covering Kirby Air Riders.</p>
<p>Presented by game director Masahiro Sakurai, the Direct will take place on 23rd October at 2pm UK time and last an hour.</p>
<p>This Direct follows a similar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-exclusive-kirby-air-riders-has-a-release-date-and-its-just-three-months-away">presentation on Kirby Air Riders that took place back in August</a>, where the game's 20th November release date was revealed.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is a follow-up to Sakurai's GameCube game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, but the director took great pains to explain it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-grand-direct-unveiling-was-classic-sakurai-as-he-jokes-its-not-another-mario-kart-clone">not just a Mario Kart clone</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer then went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-is-a-blazing-assault-on-the-senses-where-once-you-lock-in-the-magic-cuts-through-hands-on">hands-on with the game after the Direct</a>, providing further detail on its City Trial battle royale mode.</p>
<p>"Kirby Air Riders is a strange little thing. It's simple, as demonstrated in its easy-to-discern objectives and a control scheme that requires only a handful of buttons to operate," said Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson. "With that said, it has its ways in which it is complicated - at the hands-on, Nintendo had a chaperone quickly run each player through a handful of tutorials amidst a menu replete with them, clearly concerned that some players might struggle to wrangle or understand its esoteric ways.</p>
<p>"This whole dichotomy is very much Sakurai's jam. These are the fingerprints of a man who designed one of the most competitively sublime fighting games of all time... sort of by mistake."</p>
<p>With that in mind, is there much more to add in an hour-long presentation?</p>
<p>Regardless, we'll be watching the Direct to bring you all the news - check it out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_ZHYjYHHiBM">YouTube</a>.</p>

			<p>The long-rumored PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will reportedly not be announced this year, according to a well-known, reliable insider.</p>



<p>Replying to a question on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2">X</a>, reliable insider NatetheHate, who correctly revealed many video game news in the past months ahead of official announcements, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">the official reveal date for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, suggested the port's announcement will be made in 2026, unless plans change.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Believe the announcement will be in 2026 unless plans change.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 release of Starfield has been rumored for a long time and reportedly in the works since the game's release in 2023. Earlier this year, we learned that the role-playing game developed by Bethesda would <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/">release later than originally planned</a> on Sony's current-generation consoles, and that its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">release should coincide with the launch of the second expansion</a>, which could shake up the game considerably with the introduction of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/">space gameplay changes and new gameplay systems. </a>Considering the reliability of the sources of these reports, there's little doubt, at this point, that PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a while before they can embark on a new journey through space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners waiting until 2026 to enjoy Starfield may not be bad, with the new content and gameplay mechanics on the horizon. So far, free updates and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a> haven't improved the game's core issues, so its late debut would allow new users to experience Starfield in a much better state.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-potions-class-drops-to-pennies-as-amazon-clears-stock-for-spooky-season-2000637338</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-potions-class-drops-to-pennies-as-amazon-clears-stock-for-spooky-season.1330219/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lego has released plenty of Harry Potter sets over the years, and with Halloween just around the corner, Amazon’s kicking off the celebrations early by putting quite a few of them on sale. We’ve spotted Hagrid’s hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn – straight into the dungeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/">Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26</a>. That’s a nice $14 discount on a set that’ll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There’s no word on how long the discount will last, so it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four Key Characters From the Movies</h2>
<p>This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape’s lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you’ll need to bring the setup to life. You’ll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would’ve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too.</p>



<p>The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you’ve got one. As with all Lego sets, you’ll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It’s pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You’ll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There’s also a “Build Together” mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place.</p>
<p>All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It’s made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.</p>

<p>Switch 2 release, please?</p>

<figure data-uuid="3dfe4b40afd5b"><a title="Ninja Gaiden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dfe4b40afd5b/ninja-gaiden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Team Ninja, PlatinumGames, and Xbox Game Studios have just launched <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, the latest entry in the 3D hack and slash series.</p>
<p>While Switch 2 fans won't be getting in on the action (for now...), we can at least admire some stunning new artwork shared by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> publisher Dotemu. Created by David Liu, it depicts the protagonists from both major Ninja Gaiden titles this year: Kenji Mozu, Kumori, Yakumo, and of course, Ryu Hayabusa.</p>

<p>Pretty cool, right? We remain somewhat optimistic that Ninja Gaiden 4 will someday see the light of day on Switch 2, but we'll settle with this for the time being.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, meanwhile, is a stellar 2D entry in the series from acclaimed developer The Game Kitchen. While it certainly suffers from a few frame rate issues on the OG Switch, those on Switch 2 can boost the performance up to 60fps, and the resulting experience is simply extraordinary.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jhtyku&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>To commemorate the release of Ninja Gaiden 4, Ragebound players can also now experience the campaign with a free Yakumo skin, so that's nice.</p>
<p>It's also recently been confirmed that Tomonobu Itagaki has sadly passed away at the age of 58. Itagaki is the famed creator of the <strong>Dead or Alive</strong> franchise, and was chiefly responsible for Ninja Gaiden's 3D revival.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios CEO and former EA guy Patrick Söderlund has been chatting about the usage of generative AI and machine learning in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the forthcoming looter shooter with the neat motorbike helmets. He's of the opinion that while generative AI tools at large are "pioneering" inventions that "should completely change how this industry functions", "the human aspect is still essential". Nonetheless, it's patently obvious from Embark's self-commentary in general that the real pioneering element of genAI technologies is cutting specific humans out of the picture, so that More Videogame May Be Made.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Arc Raiders has just concluded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-final-free-arc-raiders-open-playtest-is-rolling-out-now-showing-off-quests-progression-and-crafting">a final "server slam" playtest</a> ahead of launch on 30th October, consolidating a rise in popularity that has punted it to third on the Steam wishlist charts. There's also been some negative reaction to the game's voice-acting, however, with some players <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/voice-quills.com/post/3m3ndhdcixc27">speculating that it is AI-generated</a>. The studio's previous multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> made use of "a combination of recorded voice actors and AI based [text-to-speech] that is based on contracted voice actors", as Embark's brand director Sven Grundberg explained to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/embark-studios-ai-let-devs-do-more-with-less-when-making-the-finals">Game Developer</a> in December 2023.
</p>
<p>Embark have yet to reveal whether Arc Raiders features generated voice-acting - I'll ask them for comment. The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam page</a> includes a very broad genAI disclosure that tells us little, save that Steam's disclosure policies are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">hopelessly unfit</a> for contributing useful information to the muddled and furious debate around genAI. It reads: "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team."
</p>

</figure>
<p>Elsewhere, Arc Raiders has been confirmed to use proprietary machine learning tools for the animation of large robot enemies, and going by Söderlund's latest remarks, the developers also have the capacity to generate 3D weapon models from Youtube videos, though it's not clear whether Arc Raiders makes use of this functionality.
</p><p>As ever with conversations around generative AI, there's a tendency to jumble together myriad tools and approaches under one label. The systems in use at Embark appear to be proprietary, relatively specialised and for internal use only, inasmuch as we can tell from developer statements. As such, they aren't in quite the same bracket of existential dread as, say Microsoft's Copilot, which is envisaged as an omni-capable "companion tool" derived from vast quantities of media without the permission of individual creators, thrust upon billions of people worldwide in the shape of mandatory updates for existing operating systems and services, and openly designed to enable widespread workforce cuts by generating a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">"local surplus"</a> of productivity.
</p>
<p>It's also important to note the difference between Embark and older companies making use of genAI, such as Microsoft and EA. Embark are relatively junior - <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nexon-makes-strategic-investment-in-patrick-s-derlunds-ambitious-new-studio">founded in 2018</a> with funding from Nexon, then <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nexon-to-fully-acquire-stock-in-embark-studios">acquired by the latter in 2021</a>. They positioned themselves early on as an R&amp;D-driven company based around "connected players, big data, speech recognition, cloud computing, and advanced AI", as Söderlund gushed in the studio's announcement materials. They aren't a legacy business like the newly private EA, who are trying to reorganise and cut staff to take advantage of a new form of automation.
</p>
<p>That said, the arguments for Arc Raider's usage of genAI are broadly similar to those offered for Copilot - it's that perennial shareholder-pleasing mantra of "doing more with less". Speaking in Edge Magazine's latest issue, as picked out and passed along by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/amid-backlash-the-finals-lead-doubles-down-on-the-fps-controversial-ai-usage-says-it-allows-the-team-to-work-better-and-faster-and-do-more-with-less/">Gamesradar</a>, Söderlund touched on his desire for Embark to be "pioneers" in the field of machine learning, based on his previous experience as co-founder of EA's SEED research division. But he added that "the beauty of videogames, as with any artform, is that - at least so far - they can't be built by an Al. I hope they never can. The human aspect is still essential."
</p>
<p>Söderlund went on to offer the familiar argument that generative AI allows developers to skip work they'd rather not do. He gave the example of the machine learning-based animation of insectile robot enemies in Arc Raiders. "What if, instead of having to hand-animate or use mocap for every single frame, we created a model, gave it physical attributes, then used AI to train it to walk?"
</p><p>Embark <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzdAqEoDv6q/?utm_source=ig_embed">posted videos</a> of this approach to animation back in 2019. Since then, Söderlund says, they've developed systems for generating weapon models. "We've come so far now," he told the mag. "Let's say that you want a new weapon built in The Finals. We can take a video from YouTube, feed it through our tools and pipelines, and [produce] a 3D model of the weapon you had in that video." The results aren't immediately usable in themselves. "That might sound like wizardry and I would be lying if I told you that it's perfect - it isn't," Söderlund went on, "but it works, and that output is something we can then work with." 
</p>
<p>I quite like the spidery Arc Raider robot animations. They remind me of the Mobile Fortress boss in 2012's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/binary-domain">Binary Domain</a>. That said, it seems important to keep puncturing the mystique and reiterate that the point of such systems isn't really devising hitherto-undreamt forms of vidyagaming. It's about doing what developers already do at less time and expense, though mileages vary considerably as to whether genAI is the workplace accelerant it's cracked up to be - there's evidence that <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">it has the opposite effect</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, Embark's machine learning engineer Tom Solberg <a href="https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c">published a Medium post</a> explaining the machine learning-based animation for Arc's robot enemies in more detail. While somewhat evangelical, the post is useful in that it alludes to differences of opinion within Embark about what kinds of development work are fit for automation - some people <em>want</em> to be able to place each robot footfall by hand.
</p>

</figure>
<p>The post also broadly reiterates the executive-level viewpoint that the real hook for genAI is theoretically being able to make more stuff at the same or less cost. "We've arrived at a workflow that allows us to create much more content with a comparatively small team, as we're not dependent on an army of animators to script every single movement and encounter that we put in the game," Solberg writes. "In fact, our aim is that our designers should be able to teach agents without input from engineers or animators at all." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> post ends before spelling out the obvious conclusion here.
</p><p>There's a lot of this genAI stuff about, isn't there? I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">a massive feature</a> exploring my feelings about Copilot, Gemini and other "big" companion AIs over the summer, following on from Mike Cook's thorough and thoughtful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">four-part exploration of the technology in 2024</a>. It feels like we should write another one, frankly. 
</p>
<p>One thing that perhaps gets lost in the tumult is that for many devs and players, objecting to genAI isn't really about the individual tools, which may have responsible or less responsible uses. It's about the overall industry push towards another threshold of profit that serves to maintain a status quo in which, for example, people like Patrick Söderlund get paid tens of millions a year, while less well-paid people are laid off whenever the upward curve on the earnings report seems worryingly shallow. Anyway I'll shut up now. This was supposed to be a quick news article. Did you catch the Arc playtest? Interested to Read Thoughts on the voices. I hear the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-were-terrorised-by-a-terrifying-foe-over-the-beta-weekend-tumbleweeds">tumbleweeds</a> are pretty disturbing as well.</p>

              <p>Gamers, is there anything worse than having to delete a game just to make space for a new one? There isn’t and thankfully, you don’t have to deal with such problems. Game file sizes are growing, which calls for a storage solution that’s not just spacious, but also fast. The Seagate storage expansion card (1TB) offers all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s currently sitting at $130 on Amazon, which is 19% off its regular price</a>. We know it’s not a massive drop, but considering how it doesn’t go on sale that often, it’s definitely worth grabbing. The only catch is that the discount might not be around for long, so it’s best to grab it quick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times, No Annoying Lags</h2>
<p>This card is designed in partnership with Xbox, so you won’t run into any frustrating compatibility issues. It also uses the same Xbox Velocity Architecture, meaning every title runs exactly as it would from internal storage. Expect faster load times, smooth gameplay, and an overall immersive environment without any slowdowns. Whether you’re playing an Original Xbox game or experimenting with the latest Series X|S release, this card handles it all.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/eve-online-catalyst-sci-fi-mmo-next-expansion-new-resource-rush/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eve-online-catalyst-is-the-sci-fi-mmo%E2%80%99s-next-expansion-and-ccp-reckons-it-will-spark-a-new-resource-rush.1330180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, CCP Games unveiled EVE Online: Catalyst, the next expansion coming to the 22-year-old sci-fi MMO. Catalyst goes live on November 18, and the developers believe it will kickstart a new resource rush due to mining becoming even more important than it already was. </p>



<p>Lore-wise, this is explained by a failed experiment on the enigmatic Drifter Gates, which has caused spacetime to become unstable, resulting in Hyperspace Fractures appearing across New Eden. These short-lived anomalies reveal Phased Asteroids rich in Prismaticite, a volatile new resource that reprocesses into random minerals in unpredictable quantities. Outer Ring Excavations engineers have created Phase Anchor technology: a deployable system that stabilises fractured asteroids for coordinated mining.</p>



<p>Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director, stated:</p>



<p><em>Mining is the foundation of all activity in EVE, and with Catalyst, it becomes the forefront of power. We’re reenergizing the mining experience, making it far more dynamic, social, and rewarding. To master the universe, you must master its materials. Whether you build or destroy, it all begins with ore.</em></p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, EVE Online's Executive Producer, added:</p>



<p><em>At face value, ore may seem unremarkable, yet it is the hidden catalyst of EVE’s biggest dramas. Creation, conflict, destruction, and rebirth – it’s the center of the eternal cycle of New Eden. But where valuable resources appear, so do rival capsuleers, turning mining operations into contested battlegrounds. Players will once again field the mightiest mining ships in pursuit of extraordinary resources, as well as the brand new Pioneer and Odysseus when Catalyst launches on November 18.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>EVE Online players will explore these volatile, time-limited rifts to find Phased Asteroids. Once they extracted Prismaticite, they can test their luck with random reprocessing or choose a different base mineral for the Prismaticite to be reprocessed into. This gives players increased agency in fuelling the mining industry and impacting the player-driven economy of EVE Online. There are also two new ships, the ‘Pioneer’ Mining Destroyer and the 'Odysseus' Exploration Command Ship. The former can be piloted by Alpha clones and upgraded by Omegas, while the latter is a long-range vessel built to allow veteran explorers to launch extended missions into uncharted regions of space.</p>



<p>With Catalyst, mining cycles have been revamped to be faster and more immersive, featuring a refreshed scanning overlay and a 2D ore availability map. The easy-to-read, tactical 2D map provides players with improved system visualisation, clear jump ranges and dual data overlays, offering precise navigation and sharper insights for exploration. Both 2D and 3D maps feature ore availability indicators and enhanced data readability, with customisable scales for greater clarity in every view. </p>



<p>Overall, resource extraction is now more unpredictable, engaging, and rewarding. Additionally, CCP Games introduced PLEX transaction logs to improve the in-game economy's transparency, and also tweaked the balance and visuals of Empire carriers.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Last month, EVE Online <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-vanguard-operation-nemesis-linked-eve-online-ccp-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became linked to EVE Vanguard through Operation Nemesis</a>, allowing players of both games to influence the same universe, a long-time goal of the studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new list of games leaving PlayStation Plus in November has been revealed, and Battlefield 5 is one of them. </p>



<p>Like all other subscription services, PlayStation Plus is known for introducing a new collection of games to the library each month, with titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn, Silent Hill 2, Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-october-2025-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, and more being added in October. However, some games are removed from the library whenever new games are added, and PS Plus will lose out on seven games in November. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-november">7 Games Are Leaving PlayStation Plus in November</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/these-7plus-games-will-be-axed-from-ps-plus-extra-in-november-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>, the PlayStation Store’s ‘Last chance to play’ section has been updated with seven new games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in November. The highlights of this collection are the previously mentioned Battlefield 5 and Like a Dragon: Ishin. The exact removal date hasn’t been revealed, but these games are expected to be available until November 18. Check out the complete list of games leaving PS Plus in November 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 5 (PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Ishin (PS4/PS5)</li>



<li>Digimon Survive (PS4)</li>



<li>Football Manager 2024 Console (PS5)</li>



<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes (PS4)</li>



<li>Alternate Jake Hunter: Daedalys The Awakening of Golden Jazz (PS4)</li>



<li>Synapse (PSVR2)</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems that the release of Battlefield 6 has led to the removal of other Battlefield games from PS Plus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-1-and-3-other-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 1 </a>was removed this month, and BF5 will be removed next month. Similarly, the addition of Yakuza: Like a Dragon will be followed by removing Like a Dragon: Ishin next month. </p>



<p>In other news, Sony has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a preliminary injunction</a> to bar Tencent from using any resemblance to Horizon’s Aloy. Will you play any of the seven games before they leave PlayStation Plus in November?

            <p>
EA is shutting down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sims-mobile">The Sims Mobile</a> after seven years, with servers going offline - and all content becoming unplayable - on 20th January next year.
</p>
<p>
The Sims Mobile launched for iOS and Android in 2017, delivering a free-to-play Sims-style experience broadly similar to that of the main series. In January this year, however, EA announced there would be no more new content updates or events for The Sims Mobile, and the publisher has now confirmed the game's imminent closure, sharing a detailed timeline for its shutdown.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">detailed on EA's website</a>, The Sims Mobile is being delisted from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store today, 21st October, at 1.30pm UTC. This follows the release of a final update earlier this week giving unlimited energy to all players (energy was previously earnable or available for purchase with real money). A schedule of events, as listed below, will remain available to players until servers shut down at 1.59pm UTC on 20th January 2026, after which The Sims Mobile will be unplayable. Additionally, all Build Mode and Create A Sim content will be unlocked for all players from 6th January.

EA notes it's no longer possible to purchase packs or spend real money within The Sims Mobile, but existing SimCash, Simoleons, and Tickets can be used until 20th January next year. Unspent currency is not eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>
"On behalf of the entire Sims Mobile team," the publisher's announcement concludes, "thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us. We hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims."
</p><p>
While EA hasn't given a reason for The Sims Mobile's shutdown, it's likely in order to clear the way for its new mobile game, currently being referred to as The Sims Labs: Town Stories. Early footage from Town Stories leaked during playtests last year, when it was still being referred to as Project Rene. Further playtest footage - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-minutes-of-eas-new-the-sims-game-concept-leak-online">under the moniker City Life Game With Friends</a>, and described as "small parts of a larger game concept" - surfaced in April, and it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.sims.mobile.town.building&amp;hl=en_GB">recently reemerged</a> on Android as The Sims Labs: Town Stories.
</p>
<p>
Project Rene was initially announced in 2022, when it was described as a "next generation Sims game and creative platform". However, EA's plans had seemingly shifted dramatically by September last year, when it revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">no longer be pursuing a direct Sims 4 "replacement"</a> - ie. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - and was instead focusing on a new approach that would allow players to keep their progress between titles and have an "ongoing experience". Needless to say, Town Stories, with its apparent endless reward-incentivised to-do lists and front-and-centre currency focus, was not what fans were clamouring for.
</p>
<p>
For the time being, the series' main focus remains on The Sim 4, which continues to receive major updates and expansions, despite now being a decade old. Its most recent expansion, the getaway themed Adventure Awaits, launched earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">is a good 'un</a>.

            Former Ridgeline Games boss and Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto has spoken out against the diminished representation of certain old Ridgeline colleagues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s credits, pointing out that some have been "entirely omitted" despite their years of work laying the "foundation" for EA's new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>.


</p><!--more-->
<p>Ridgeline were once pretty central to Battlefield 6. Back in 2022, they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">unveiled as the creators of the next Battlefield singleplayer campaign</a>, but EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shut them down</a> in the course of mass layoffs over February 2024, with some Ridgeline staff being transferred to another Battlefield studio, Ripple Effect.
</p>
<p>"I'm disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6," Lehto wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/">a LinkedIn post yesterday</a>.
</p>
<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered," he went on. "Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a 'Special Thanks' section at the very end of the credits -- and several were omitted entirely, including myself.
</p>
<p>"Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them -- listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits. Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."
</p><p>Specifically, Lehto cites software engineers Jessica Moore and Dan Carr, lead tech artist Rohan Knuckey, and lead character artist Andres Naranjo as having been unfairly overlooked. He credits himself as vice president, studio general manager and franchise director. Here's a video of the full official BF6 credit reel, for context.</p>

<p>Incomplete crediting of developers is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/05/18/video-game-credits-policy/">one of the persistent evils</a> that affects big budget games. Developers may labour on a game for the best part of a decade and come away without an appropriate namecheck, because they left or were laid off before shipping. External contributors and people in certain, devalued areas of game creation <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/translators-and-external-developers-reportedly-missing-from-baldurs-gate-3-credits">are more prone to being left out</a>. Sometimes, the threat of a withheld credit is used as a cudgel to stop people resigning from roles they hate.</p>
<p>All that said, it's worth noting that Lehto's reading of Battlefield 6's credits is a bit sketchy. As he acknowledges in the comments on that LinkedIn post, three of the people he says EA have omitted are actually cited elsewhere in the credits.</p>

            <p>Part three of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy will be more "concise", said director Naoki Hamaguchi, as fan feedback from Rebirth has been taken into account.</p>
<p>Rebirth, the second part of the trilogy, shifted to an open world filled with minigames, but some players criticised story sections for being too drawn out.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-bgs/">Screen Rant</a>, Hamaguchi disagreed but is still taking on such feedback while developing the next game.</p>

<p>"Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">FF7 Rebirth</a>, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary," he said. "I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p>
<p>He added: "As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p>
<p>Rebirth did, however, introduce some great minigames like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-queens-blood-is-the-best-card-game-of-the-year">card game Queen's Blood</a>. Hopefully being more "concise" with storytelling will still leave space for innovation and amusing side activities.</p>
<p>What's more, in a previous interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-part-three-will-have-some-sort-of-fresh-gameplay-experience-but-its-a-big-secret-for-now">Hamaguchi stated the third game will have some form of new gameplay experience</a>, though it remains under wraps.</p>
<p>"But moving forward to the third game in the series," he said, "obviously I can't say exactly what it is, but I don't want to deliver just exactly the same style of gameplay experience as we had with Rebirth again. We're going to evolve it and change it again to give another different and fresh take on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> gameplay. Again, that will be revealed in the not too distant future. I can say we're working on it and we're trying to change that because we've actually got a build up and running in the development team right now where you can experience that new style of gameplay."</p><p>It certainly seems, then, that part three will be a step on from Rebirth, not only adding something fresh beyond simply wrapping up the story, but taking fan feedback into account too. Let's just hope the convoluted narrative of the Remake trilogy concludes comprehensively.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hamaguchi previously said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">multiplatform approach for the trilogy won't impact development "whatsoever"</a>, now that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">and will be followed by subsequent games</a>.</p>

            <p>Fingers have been pointed regarding the ROG Xbox Ally X's beefy £800 / $1000 price tag. Xbox, whose name is on the handheld, have pointed to collaborators Asus as having spearheaded that decision, with president Sarah Bond saying that it came down to the hardware company's assessment of what'd be acceptable to charge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware," Bond told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/">Variety</a>. "That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices."</p>
<p>"I feel really good about the value that we’re giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware," she added.</p>
<p>As our James acknowledged in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Xbox Ally X review</a>, the handheld's price certainly doesn't leave it a no brainer bargain, but isn't massively out of step with what other handhelds go for:</p>
<blockquote>The fact that it costs £800 (or a crisp $1000 in the US) doesn’t help, but then the MSI Claw 8 AI+ already proved that it can be worth splashing out if framerates and practicality are up to premium standards. The ROG Xbox Ally X sometimes makes the cut, though is just as often outpolished or outlasted by its peers, and even suffers from outright faults that undermine Asus and Microsoft’s genuinely good UX work.</blockquote>
<p>I'm having a little trouble believing that Xbox, whose CEO Phil Spencer made no secret of how much he pines for the handhelds prior to pulling the trigger on an Xbox-branded one, didn't have any say in the figure which was stuck on the box. If you're putting your company's name on the thing and want to minimise the potential that has to backfire, surely the price is one of the elements on your radar to discuss thoroughly, even if you think you're likely going to be happy trusting in Asus' cited mountains of wisdom.</p><p>Then again, an exec earning massive wads of cash to make these sorts of calls and deals I am not. Plus, there's the much-discussed issue of US tarrifs and their potential impact on the cost of goods like the like the Xbox Ally X, which seemed to be alluded to via the phrase "time to figure the macroeconomic impact to pricing" when Asus and Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-lock-in-a-release-date-for-their-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-but-no-price-yet-because-macroeconomics">opted to push back announcing the handheld's price</a> by a couple of months.</p>

<p>A post on Palworld’s official <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980439049853710677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account confirms the Halloween 2025 update.

<p>It seems that Palworld is taking it up a notch from their Halloween update in 2024. Last year’s update provided players with free cosmetics for their pals, including Halloween Cattiva, Spectacled Katress, Pirate Pengullet, and Halloween Croajiro. It looks like the developers are upping their game in 2025, adding some spooky elements to the game’s world to match the festivals’ vibe. Moreover, this comes after the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “things are going to be a little quiet from us for the rest of the year”, as they work on the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>In other news, a former Capcom designer recently stated that Palworld “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-crossed-a-line-says-former-capcom-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed a line</a>” and players shouldn’t buy the game. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a patent expert recently commented</a> on the Nintendo v Palworld lawsuit.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director has mentioned the possibility of a DLC or another ‘full title’ after part 3.</p>



<p>There’s still some time left before Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Part 3 is revealed; however, we do know that development has been progressing well, with the game already having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘a lot’ of playable content</a>. Interestingly, the developers are already thinking about their plans after the release of part 3, which could entail a new expansion or a fourth game. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WccfTech</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked whether they had any DLC plans for Rebirth. Hamaguchi stated that there were ideas at some point, but they “revisited this topic” and realised that their priority should be what fans want the most. The dev figured that “what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible.” Which meant that the next game took priority over DLC. </p>



<p>However, Hamaguchi revealed that the story doesn’t end there, as “there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment” after its launch. Moreover, with that being the conclusion to Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy, “there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole”, says the director. Which is why the developers are “actively considering” whether to introduce “another DLC or a full title”. </p>
