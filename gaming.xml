			<p>The God of War Greek Saga is rumored to be in the works after a <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1844400692120912202?t=h5qjwTNAaBqgLTBtJvZbZg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user on X</a> says that says that all of the games that were created in the Greek Saga will be developed and remastered by Santa Monica Studios in collaboration with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nixxes-is-working-more-and-more-on-remasters-claims-dev/">Nixxes Software</a>. However, it's advised to take this statement with a huge pinch of salt, as there are no cited sources, and there haven't been any rumblings about these games being remastered previously. Of course, it is entirely possible that they are correct, but without posting any sort of source, it's hard to know for sure.</p>
<p>According to the post on X, it's alleged that the development of all of the games in the God of War Greek Saga is already finished, and they are just waiting to announce the remaster's release date. It's reported that these remastered titles (if they exist) will be released in 2025, with an announcement about the games coming from any time in December through to March.&nbsp; When most people think of the Greek Saga of God of War, most people think of God of War I through to III, but it's reported that the remastered Greek Saga will include all of the PSP games as well as God of War: Ascension.</p>
<p>One of the only God of War games that wasn't mentioned to be remastered was God of War: Betrayal. The comments on the post are mixed, with some saying that it would be a day one purchase for them, with others being disappointed that it's potentially a remaster and not a remake of the games instead.</p>
<p>Santa Monica Studios is known for making the God of War franchise, with them helping externally in other games such as Journey and Twisted Metal. They also helped to develop God of War III Remastered, which provides more context as to why they may be working on developing a remaster or remake of the God of War Greek Saga.</p>
<p>As stated before, this is just a rumor from someone who has had trustworthy leaks before, but it could be a complete falsehood. There are no sources to verify this claim, and there have been no other reports of the games being in development by Santa Monica Studios or Nixxes Software.</p>

For weeks, ever since Nintendo skipped its traditional September showcase, there has been background chatter suggesting that official news would finally be coming about the Switch 2 any day now. Instead, the company rolled out Alarmo without batting an eye. Pre-orders went live and have already sold out. Naturally, some people are trying to sell Alarmo, which doesn’t ship until 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l65vlfyhtp2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l65vlfyhtp2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for close to double its standard price on eBay</a></span>.</p><p>But the funniest part about Alarmo is that it doesn’t work well for couples. The sensor that shuts the clock off when you get out of bed has trouble distinguishing when there are two people sleeping together. “Alarmo can’t detect a specific person, so if multiple people are sleeping in the same bed within range of the sensor, the alarm may stop when one person gets out of bed, but restart once it detects there is still someone in bed,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66618/~/nintendo-sound-clock%3A-alarmo-faq#s1q6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66618/~/nintendo-sound-clock%3A-alarmo-faq#s1q6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads the FAQ</a></span>. “The alarm will stop completely once everyone is out of bed.”</p><p>Sounds like fun.

That means a lot of the characters and lore from the mobile title carry over to <em>Relink </em>to continue their stories. That connection needn’t be a deal-breaker for those who have no experience with the mobile game, however, as in all honesty <em>Relink</em>’s story is hardly its best quality. There are some compelling tales you can uncover in side quests, but<em> Relink</em>’s best aspects are its fantastic combat and the environments you’ll explore.</p><p>Most of <em>Relink </em>consists of missions in which your hero and three other adventurers battle their way through hordes of enemies until you reach a boss. Like in its predecessor, you have a lot of potential party members to choose from, and team composition is both the most important part of the game, and also the most fun. That’s because you can mix and match to your heart’s content, finding the perfect play style and party that works best for you. Combat is real-time and can play out quite differently depending on your characters’ attributes. There are magic wielders, good old-fashioned guys with swords, and more, and combat requires you to use their assortment of abilities to chain together attacks while also timing blocks and dodges to avoid damage. Battles can get pretty exciting as you use everything in your arsenal and have to really think about what you’re doing. Your party members will act on their own, but you’ll be shocked by how well they’ll support you, which is one of <em>Relink</em>’s greatest accomplishments. </p><p>To add a cherry on top, long-time <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-game-music-1851286825&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-game-music-1851286825">Nobuo Uemetsu</a></span> did a lot of music for the original gacha game and those tracks constantly appear in <em>Relink</em>. If you’re a longtime fan of his work at Square Enix, you’ll immediately recognize the distinctive flair of his tracks when you hear them in <em>Relink</em>, and they really help make the game feel like the charming RPG it is. If somehow you have the time in your life for another massive RPG, you shouldn’t miss the opportunity to grab <em>Relink </em>for $35.99 on PC and PlayStation while the deal lasts.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Corsair and Activision have unveiled a stunning collaboration that’s set to deliver Call of Duty fans everywhere a cutting-edge line-up of high-performance gaming peripherals. This multi-year, cross-brand partnership will see everything from keyboards and headsets to Scuf controllers and entire gaming PCs produced with Call of Duty branding slapped front and centre.</p>



<p>This news comes mere days away from the launch of Black Ops 6, one of the most highly anticipated games in the Call of Duty series for years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-a-gamer-could-want">Everything a Gamer Could Want</h2>



<p>The partnership, which has been dubbed ‘a powerful new integration’, sees Activision and Corsair join forces, uniting to produce, market, and deliver a phenomenal range of gaming peripherals, all of which are on theme for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>This line-up includes: </p>



<ul>
<li>HS80 RGB Wireless Headset</li>



<li>M75 Wireless Mouse</li>



<li>Vengeance Series Gaming PC</li>



<li>Reflex Scuf Controller</li>



<li>Envision Scuf Controller</li>



<li>Elgato Stream Deck MK.2</li>



<li>Artisan Keycaps</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a mere taste of what’s on offer as part of this incredible partnership.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Corsair is leaning full bore into its full range of subsidiaries with this collaboration effort. From the Elgato streaming equipment to competition-grade Scuf controller favoured by Call of Duty League pro players, you will soon be able to craft an entire setup themed on Black Ops 6, right down to controller carry cases and desk mats.</p>



<p>Thi La, the President and COO at Corsair, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to be teaming up with Activision and have our world-class brands come together as CORSAIR is set to deliver premium performance for Call of Duty players across all platforms whether it’s playing Black Ops 6, capturing amazing content or streaming with friends.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve been in the Call of Duty scene for a <strong>very </strong>long time, and this is by far the most ambitious collaboration I’ve seen with a tech manufacturer ahead of the launch of a new Call of Duty title. It’s difficult to stress just how deep this partnership runs, and the product line that has been created to pay tribute to Black Ops 6 is <strong>insane</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you going to invest in any of the new Black Ops 6 peripherals from Corsair? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Splinter Cell Remake is making progress at Ubisoft despite rumors that the game has been quietly canceled. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the game is being developed under the codename North. In addition to the codename, sources have confirmed that the game is being built in the Snowdrop Engine. Previous Splinter Cell games used Unreal Engine 2 and 2.5.</p>



<p>Snowdrop has been used to develop games like Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Star Wars Outlaws.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>First announced in December 2021, the Splinter Cell Remake is  is being led by Ubisoft Toronto. The studio seemed to tease information on the game coming soon. However, that has yet to happen. </p>



<p>When it was first revealed, the game’s produce Matt West said that it was in the “very earliest stages of development”. He added that the game was being built from the ground up with updates to the game’s visuals while saying that the game would remain linear.</p>



<p>“As we’re building it from the ground up, we’re going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world,” West said at the time. “The gameplay experience we are targeting is directly tied to what we want players to feel, to capture the essence back when we were all playing the original games.”</p>







<p>Sources have suggested that a release date could come in 2026, but didn’t want to be held to that time frame.</p>

That challenge is going to be more intense than usual for the first weekend of Vesper's Host, because for the first time, Bungie is running a world's first completion race similar to those it puts on for its raids. As players compete to be the first in the world to finish Vesper's Host, they'll have to deal with "contest mode," which amps up the difficulty of the activity to level the playing field.</p><p>There's a lot going on with Vesper's Host, from its race to its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-revenant-every-new-exotic/2900-5854/" data-ref-id="2900-5854">Exotic weapon</a>, Ice Breaker, a returning favorite from the original Destiny.

It also seems to tease the return of Atraks, a boss from the Deep Stone Crypt raid. More on that when we talk about story below.</p><h2 id="When_does_Vesper_s_Host_launch_">When does Vesper's Host launch?</h2><p>Vesper's Host becomes available in Destiny 2 starting at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Friday, October 11. At that point, you'll be able to jump into the dungeon in a fireteam of three, as long as everyone has the Final Shape Dungeon Key. You will also need to stop by Spider in the Last City hub area (formerly the HELM) and pick up the "Rogue Network" quest to get access to the dungeon.</p><h2 id="How_does_contest_mode_work_">How does contest mode work?</h2><p>As with raids, Vesper's Host will include a contest mode that last through the first 48 hours of its launch, which means the mode will stay in effect until 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Sunday, October 13.</p><p>Contest mode works by capping player levels at a certain point beneath the recommended level for an activity's encounters, essentially normalizing the challenge so that a team can't gain an advantage by scrambling to level up their characters in the days before the activity's launch. In the case of Vesper's Host, players need to be at Power level of 1985 to meet the cap for all activities.</p><p>Completing contest mode is the best way to get Ice Breaker, the Exotic sniper rifle available within the dungeon. As in other dungeons, it seems like Ice Breaker will be a random drop for completing the dungeon, meaning it won't be guaranteed--but if other dungeons are any indication, it's likely that you'll be able to increase the chance of receiving the gun by completing Triumphs within it. You can skip that whole rigmarole, however, by finishing the dungeon in contest mode.</p><p>You'll also get the exclusive emblem, Orbital Tournament, if you complete contest mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382733-orbitaltournamentemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382733-orbitaltournamentemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382733"></a><figcaption>Orbital Tournament</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382733-orbitaltournamentemblem.jpg"></figure><p>If you want to play Vesper's Host in the opening weekend but <em>don't</em> want the increased challenge of contest mode, don't worry--you're not forced into it. Normal mode will become available as soon as the first three teams clear it, and with a dungeon, that should be within the first few hours of its release. For the rest of the weekend, you'll be free to choose between the two modes.</p><h2 id="What_weapons_and_armor_are_disabled_in_contest_mode_">What weapons and armor are disabled in contest mode?</h2><p>Bungie has noted that it'll be disabling some gear during Vesper's Host's contest mode, something that often happens during raid races, as well. We don't know exactly what Bungie is disabling, but the developer announced it'll release the list at approximately 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday on its <a href="https://x.com/BungieHelp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@BungieHelp</a> Twitter/X account.</p><h2 id="How_to_watch_the_dungeon_Race">How to watch the dungeon Race</h2><p>Even if you're not playing, you can take part in the Vesper's Host race by watching teams take it on on Twitch on the <a href="https://schedule.twitchrivals.com/events/destiny-2-vesper-s-host-dungeon-race-on-twitch-rivals-P9qyE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch Rivals channel</a>. Coverage starts at 9:30 PT / 12:30 ET on Friday. Watching the dungeon coverage can also get you two emblems through Twitch Drops.</p><p>Watching two hours of any Destiny 2 streamer with Twitch Drops enabled gets you the Effortless Flow emblem.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382734-effortless_flow_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382734" data-ratio="0.31496062992126" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382734-effortless_flow_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382734"></a><figcaption>Effortless Flow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382734-effortless_flow_emblem-social.jpg"></figure><p>If you subscribe to a Destiny 2 streamer who has Twitch Drops enabled, you get the Broadcasting from the Dark emblem.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382735-broadcasting_from_the_dark_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382735" data-ratio="0.31496062992126" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382735-broadcasting_from_the_dark_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382735"></a><figcaption>Broadcasting from the Dark</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382735-broadcasting_from_the_dark_emblem-social.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Vesper_s_Host_Exotic_weapon__Ice_Breaker">Vesper's Host Exotic weapon: Ice Breaker</h2><p>Ice Breaker is going to be a pretty good reason to head into Vesper's Host, especially in contest mode. The Solar sniper rifle was originally released in Destiny 1, where it was a bit broken--you couldn't reload it, but it would automatically regenerate its own ammo, meaning it was almost always ready to put some big damage on bosses.</p><p>The Destiny 2 version of Ice Breaker, a Special ammo sniper, has been tweaked a bit so it's not quite so game-breaking, but it's still pretty powerful. It has a chance to regenerate ammo whenever you get kills with your other weapons, and kills on tougher combatants offer the chance to generate multiple rounds. Like the original, kills with Ice Breaker cause enemies to explode. Precision kills and shattering a frozen enemy get added benefits, causing a Solar Ignition, which spread Scorch around the explosion to do burning damage to nearby targets.</p><h2 id="What_s_Vesper_s_Host_s_story_">What s Vesper's Host's story?</h2><p>We're a little thin on details about what exactly is happening in Vesper's Host, but with the trailer and some other hints, we're starting to form a picture of what's going on. (We'll also update this section with more details once the dungeon is released and we know more.)</p><p>The kick off for Vesper's Host is investigating a strange signal coming from a seemingly defunct Braytech facility. The trailer suggests there's a connection between this facility and the Deep Stone Crypt, the location of the raid from the Beyond Light expansion. In that facility, Clovis Bray, the leader of the company that bore his name, worked on the Exo program, where he created robots into which human brains could be downloaded--but he did that through a bunch of horrific experiments on humans, using Vex technology, and with the help of one of the Darkness statues utilized by The Witness. So generally, it was all pretty bad news.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382854-vespershostatraks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382854" data-ratio="0.45756746186938" data-width="2557" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382854-vespershostatraks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382854"></a><figcaption>Deep Stone Crypt raid boss Atraks is apparently waiting in the dungeon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382854-vespershostatraks.jpg"></figure><p>One major element of the Deep Stone Crypt was that Clovis used instructions from the Darkness statue to create a big portal to a strange Vex world, where he was able to capture Vex constructs to experiment on. You see that portal in the Glassway Strike--it's the means by which the Vex invaded Europa in the past, and continue to do so on occasion now. It's not exactly clear, but it seems like the Braytech facility we're dealing with could be related to that initiative to steal Vex, and possibly is even a staging area Clovis created near the Vex world to study it. That big ring floating in space feels related to this whole idea.</p><p>The connections with the Deep Stone Crypt are intentional, in any event. Guardians in the trailer are wearing Deep Stone Crypt raid armor, for one thing, and Exos and Vex can be seen throughout the environment. The trailer teases the return of a DSC raid boss: Atraks, the first Eliksni Exo. Players defeated Atraks in the orbital station above the Crypt during that raid, but with Exos being robots, it seems as though another copy of Atraks might exist. What she's up to is not particularly clear, nor do we know if she's working with the Fanatic, Fikrul, the major villain of Revenant.</p>

Zero is just still in early access, launching in full tomorrow (October 11), but that hasn't stopped fans from pushing it to massive early numbers on Steam.</p><p>In fact, Sparking! Zero has sped past the peak player counts of every other Dragon Ball game — and it's not even close. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> currently reports a peak player count of 91,005, which was achieved two days ago. As of the writing of this story, the game still has a sizeable amount of players (55,732 currently, with a 24-hour peak of 70,558), sustaining inarguably healthy momentum leading up to its proper release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/dragon-1728585567350.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero already has a peak player count of 91,005. Credit: <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/">SteamDB</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>That's already impressive when you consider that's just players who shelled out $100 or more for Sparking! Zero's Deluxe or Ultimate Editions, which allow for access to the game three days early. But that number also doubles the Dragon Ball fighting game with the next-highest peak player count, Dragon Ball FighterZ, which topped out at 44,303 per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/678950/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> charts. </p><p>It's pretty major when you compare it to other major fighting game franchises, too. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street Fighter 6</a> had a peak player count of 70,573 16 months ago, while <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1971870/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mortal Kombat 1</a> peaked with 38,129 players on Steam 13 months ago. </p><p>That player count will only rise when those who purchased the standard edition of Fighting! Zero get their hands on it tomorrow, so it's worth keeping an eye on. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">our review in progress</a>, where we said playing the latest mainline entry in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series "feels just as much like a labor of love as the effort to resurrect the series in the first place."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p dir="ltr">Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has hinted at launching a Twitch channel focused on the strategy video game Civilization. During the Meta Connect 2024 conference, he spoke with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" rel="nofollow ">Pubity</a><span>, revealing his </span><span>deep passion for the game: "In terms of strategy games, the one that I'm more likely to want to be the best in the world at is Civilization." </span>Zuckerberg didn't specify which version of Civilization he plays, leaving it unclear whether he means the original or a more recent entry in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Zuckerberg offered insight into his gaming routine, joking about his wife's reaction to his playtime logged. "Priscilla looked at my Steam account the other day and she's like: 'What? You've played this for more than a thousand hours?'" He went on to say, "I think at some point, I should do like a Twitch stream of me playing with someone. Because I'm pretty convinced that I'm close to grandmaster status. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world could beat me at that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_JrrP9m2U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Sid Meier's Civilization franchise, developed by Firaxis Games, has sold over 50 million copies globally, according to publisher 2K Games. Zuckerberg has previously mentioned his fondness for the game, even recalling during his <a href="https://youtu.be/BmYv8XGl-YU?t=133" rel="nofollow ">2017 Harvard commencement speech</a> how he received his college acceptance letter while playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">The timing of Zuckerberg's comments appears to coincide with efforts to reshape his public persona. During the interview, he sported a black T-shirt reading "Zuck or nothing" in Latin, a departure from his usual minimalist wardrobe of gray shirts.</p><p dir="ltr">Following his remarks, popular Civilization streamer Potato McWhiskey <a href="https://youtu.be/fbo5qiXi1f0" rel="nofollow ">issued a challenge</a>, stating, "I challenge you, Mark Zuckerberg, to a 1v1 duel in Civilization," on his YouTube channel. The official Civilization account also chimed in, responding, "See you in the arena, Zuckerberg."</p><p dir="ltr">Civilization fans have been eagerly awaiting the next installment, which arrives on PC and consoles in February 2025. Early access for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Civilization 7</a> begins February 6 for select editions, while the standard release is set for February 11.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-you-to-use-guides-and-i%E2%80%99m-here-for-it.1006650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The rhythm of playing a gigantic, choice-based game in the modern era is one of quiet tedium. You reach a branching path or a place where there’s a risk of missing out on Optimal Content, and like clockwork, you grab your phone and pull up a guide for that specific moment. Big video game sites, once devoted mainly to news and reviews, are now optimized for this. And while there’s no shame in seeking out the odd tip or trick, it’s hard to fully lose yourself in an experience when you’re constantly abandoning Big Screen for Small, Horrible Screen. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em> proposes a better way.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em>, basically a new <em>Persona </em>in fantasy pajamas, is the kind of game I’d normally be checking guides for every several seconds. Like its high school-centric siblings, it operates on a calendar system that sees you split your time each in-game day between various activities like dungeon delving, hanging out with friends/followers, and boosting various “virtues” (which aid you in unlocking new characters and activities). Major events and quests often come with attached time limits as the game’s world continues to move around you. Just as there are optimal paths through each <em>Persona </em>game – which allow you to maximize bonds with party members and other characters, seeing their stories play out in full – I’m sure there’s a “correct” way to play <em>Metaphor</em>. Conversely, I imagine there are cool things I can miss, a thought that terrifies me.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I’m determined to avoid spending half my time with <em>Metaphor </em>consulting Polygon or whoever (no offense, y’all), and on top of that, I’m currently playing a review copy ahead of the game’s official release, so I literally can’t. Typically this limitation would fill me with dread, but <em>Metaphor </em>has proven shockingly accommodating. It’s clear that Studio Zero recognized how many people play its games and built in-game systems accordingly. </p><p>While Gallica, your fairy companion, can be helpful on this front by gently nudging you in the direction of specific side activities if you ask her to, the real game changer for me is “Travellers’ Voices,” an online feature that shows you what other players have done each new day that you reach. You need only press a button, and boom, you have the sum totality of other players’ lived experiences at your fingertips (which in my case means other people with review copies for now).&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, <em>Metaphor </em>doesn’t collate this data into a prescriptive set of instructions. Instead, the game divides other players’ journeys up into four basic categories – “spent time with supporters,” “spent time in town,” spent time in a labyrinth,” and one I still haven’t unlocked yet – each accompanied by the percentage of players who performed that activity on a given day. Details beyond that are often vague; for example, “took in the scenery” or “talked with an activist” if you’re in town. </p><p>In other words, you’ve still got to do the legwork. You don’t know <em>exactly </em>what you’re in for, unlike with a guide. This system even extends to battle. If you want, you can view a selection of the class/character/level builds players used to tackle various challenges and switch your party accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate how organic it all feels. <a href="https://aftermath.site/yellow-paint-video-game-ledge-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow paint</a> this ain’t. Instead, you’re stumbling through a dark cave by following the echoes of those who came before, of entities who are at least somewhat acknowledged by the game’s fiction. And they could be wrong! 30-50 percent of people are often wrong about a lot of things! But FOMO is a social phenomenon just as much as it’s born of what you’re actually missing out on. There is comfort, however slight, in knowing that other people also went to the awkward housewarming instead of the wild rager. </p><p>More importantly, it dispels the illusion that there’s a “right” and “wrong” way to play a game like <em>Metaphor</em>. There are just many different ways, and not everyone is optimizing and having a “better” experience than you. That’s to say nothing of the fact that regret is a powerful and interesting emotion, one games rarely encourage us to sit with in favor of fulfilling our fantasies at every turn. Greater awareness that people aren’t all playing the same way hopefully means more <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion of those regrets</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar systems, I gather, were present in <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> and <em>Persona 3 Reloaded</em>, which makes me substantially more interested in playing those games as well. The last <em>Persona </em>I played was the base version of <em>Persona 5</em>, and I fell off it precisely because I started to feel less like I was exploring a mysterious occult world and more like I was trying to organize my convoluted IRL social calendar (which I keep in the Notes app on my phone, because I’m a freak). Already, there’s less of a nagging weight on my shoulders when I’m playing <em>Metaphor</em>. Maybe that will change as I become more invested in the world and characters – and websites start to publish guides – but for now I’m just… playing the game. It’s freeing. What’s the point of FOMO, after all, if it takes away your ability to be present in a moment? You were so worried about getting there that you forgot to enjoy it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In case you don’t know—and who could blame you—being an Amazon Prime subscriber neets you a whole bunch of benefits beyond two-day shipping and Prime TV. For example, you also get benefits on Twitch like exclusive emotes and a free subscription to give to your favorite streamer, as well as free games that release in waves every month across a variety of PC storefronts. Prime Gaming is probably the most innocuous games subscription service of the bunch, but it also packs some of the best offers if you’re privy to it, and this month is no slouch.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

If you thought 2016’s <em>DOOM </em>had massive levels, <em>Eternal </em>is several times larger, lending it an epic feeling that rarely feels artificial. The demons you kill are larger than life, but the Doom Slayer’s capacity for ripping and tearing is even larger, and it’s truly impressive to watch this gorefest in action.</p><p>Other highlights from October’s Prime Gaming drops include the indie rhythm action game <em>No Straight Roads, </em>the <em>Zelda-</em>like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-s-door-is-as-good-as-everyone-says-1847410512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-s-door-is-as-good-as-everyone-says-1847410512"><em>Death’s Door</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040"><em>Pumpkin Jack</em></a></span>, a 3D platformer that’s become a bit of a cult classic in the years since its release. I’ve heard great things about <em>No Straight Roads </em>from folks who’ve played it, and I can personally attest to the reputation of <em>Death’s Door</em>, which was my favorite game of 2021! Between these three games and <em>DOOM Eternal</em>, there’s a hell of a lot of variety in this bunch of free games.</p><p>If you’re feeling in a spooky mood given the month we’re in, there’s a few games perfectly aimed at you. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537"><em>Scorn</em></a></span><em> </em>is a first-person puzzle game that is absolutely horrifying and grotesque to look at, and I mean that in the best possible ways. Its incredible visual fidelity is leveraged to render the most sumptuous H.R Giger-esque environments. Walking around in that game <em>feels</em> like traveling through the innards of a Xenomorph nest. If you like your horror games with a bit of a psychological bent, it’s hard not to recommend <em>Bioshock Remastered</em>. After all, there’s nothing scarier than the ruling class in any capitalistic society, especially one built by a magnate. </p><p>There’s also a game that I know nothing about that’s simply called <em>Priest Simulator: Vampire Show</em>. One of those words is definitely in the Bible, but I don’t believe anyone has ever been brave enough to stick them altogether like that till now. If you’re anything like me, a bizarre title is all you need to jump into what seems to be an equally strange experience.</p><p>The majority of this month’s games are available now, but the rest of them, like <em>The Gunk</em>, <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, and <em>Monster Train</em> will be releasing on every subsequent Thursday of the month, right up to Halloween. In other words, there’ll be no shortage of free goodies to play every week of the spooky season.

<p>Yes, Blizzard, I have a phone, but I don’t frequently use it to play mobile games. I prefer to play on PC, hunched awkwardly over a mouse and keyboard. But like many of you, I’ve had my eye on Bethesda’s latest mobile game, and now that it’s finally available to everyone on both Android and iOS, I most certainly want to play The Elder Scrolls Castles on PC instead!</p>







<p>While The Elder Scrolls Castles isn’t natively supported on PC, it’s entirely possible to play the point-and-click adventure game using the likes of <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/simulation/the-elder-scrolls-castles-on-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluestacks</a>. The third-party app lets you install a client to your computer and then run the Android Play Store. You’ll be asked to sign in to your Google account. After that, you can navigate the entire mobile storefront as if playing on your smartphone, downloading the games and apps you’d like to run on your PC.</p>



<p>Search the store for The Elder Scrolls Castles through the Bluestacks launcher, download the game, and launch it once ready. You may receive a black screen. If you do, close out of the game and relaunch the title.</p>

<p>Similarly to Fallout Shelter, The Elder Scrolls Castles tasks you with building a miniature empire. Instead of a vault, you’ll construct a medieval castle in the fantasy setting, ruling over the kingdom, defeating enemies, decorating each room to your liking, and interacting with unique characters and races from The Elder Scrolls universe.</p>



<p>The game features 20 levels, interactive gameplay mechanics, unique landscapes, and more to explore. It’s definitely one long-time fans of The Elder Scrolls will want to check out in their spare time, but don’t expect to play for hundreds of hours like in Skyrim. It’s not quite that deep, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls Castles isn’t the only game in the long-running franchise that’s doing well.

<p>The first details about possible preorders for Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon may have just been found. According to data miners, Marathon preorders could begin sometime in Q1 2025.</p>



<p>Bungie recently released an update for Destiny 2, and players immediately started to data mine the files from the update. Within that information (first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-pre-order-destiny-2-files-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>) comes a text string that reads “v820.offers.entitlements.d2.marathon.preorder”.</p>



<p>The beginning of the string, v820, is where the suggestion comes. Bungie uses version numbers for its Destiny 2 expansions. With v810 representing the current Revenant episode, v820 would reference the next episode, Heresy. That episode is scheduled to release on February 4, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning, that nothing about potential dates or releases for Marathon have been confirmed by Bungie. The latest news on the game came in September regarding when Bungie planned to hold its next major look at the game. According to those claims, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-significant-reveal-for-bungies-marathon-until-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next “significant reveal”</a> wasn’t going to happen until Spring 2025.</p>



<p>Last known, Bungie is still planning for a 2025 release for Marathon. The game has seen multiple changes during its development ranging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from its direction</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">management at the top</a>. There’s even concern from some inside that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-reaction-isnt-great-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t hit it’s current release deadline.</a></p>



<p>When do you think fans will hear something on Marathon from Bungie? Join the discussion below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's text-based moderation of in-game text chat and usernames includes 20 languages, and it will also be active for the launch of Black Ops 6.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> features a job system referred to as Archetypes, which allows you to swap any of your party members to any Archetype pretty freely. While there are some requirements to use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-all-advanced-archetypes-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6526963/">advanced Archetypes</a>, you will want to swap out Archetypes frequently. In some cases, like certain side dungeons, there are specific Archetypes that will be recommended based on the enemy weaknesses found there, but you can also ignore that if you like your setup. One of the most important factors for determining your team composition is the synthesis abilities that become available when you have specific Archetypes present in your party.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mage with Seeker, Healer, or Mage</h2><p dir="ltr">The Mage Archetype tree is incredibly powerful, especially early on, since it has access to fire, ice, and electric attacks, which allows you to target a variety of enemy weaknesses. However, the abilities the Mage and its advanced versions can use only targets a single enemy. If you want to use a version that can target all enemies at once, you will need to use the Synthesis version of these abilities, which only becomes available if you have another Mage, a Seeker, or a Healer present. Of those three options, the best to go with is the Healer since the Healer gets to use a light damage attack that targets all enemies if a Mage is present.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metaphor: ReFantazio Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Knight with back row damage dealers</h2><p dir="ltr">The Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight's pierce damage isn't effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Summoner and Masked Dancer</h2><p dir="ltr">Perhaps one of the best combinations in Metaphor: ReFantazio, the Summoner and Masked Dancer duo is incredibly powerful. The Masked Dancer gains access to abilities that inflict one-time elemental weaknesses to enemies<strong>,</strong> and the Summoner has access to the largest variety of elemental attacks in the game. That means you can make all of your enemies weak to a specific element, like ice, and immediately dish out a high-damage ice attack that hits all enemies, dealing big damage and letting you take more turns. <strong>An important part of this comp is making sure you have the correct Vessels and Masks to take advantage of this. </strong>Make sure to craft these items in Akademia whenever you have the materials.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gunner with Gunner, Faker, or Summoner</h2><p dir="ltr">Pierce physical damage is the least common of the three physical attack types, so whenever you have to deal with a dungeon featuring a large number of monsters with a weakness to Pierce, the Gunner is your best fit. If you have another Gunner, a Faker, or a Summoner present, you can use the Synthesis ability Wild Barrage, which hits all enemies with Pierce damage multiple times.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Berserker with Knight</h2><p dir="ltr">The Berserker can access two Strike damage synthesis abilities that deal massive damage, as long as a Knight is present. These two abilities, Wanton Destruction and Battlecry Tackle, have one Archetype overlap, which is the Knight. Wanton Destruction, in particular, is great, because it deals extreme physical Strike damage and it inflicts a one-time weakness to Strike. After the first use, you can continually use it every turn without losing any turn icons thanks to the weakness, making it great for tough enemies with a large amount of health.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Trickster</h2><p dir="ltr">The Trickster, the advanced version of the Faker, has access to an extreme physical Almighty attack that doesn't consume MP. Almighty damage is a special kind of damage that enemies cannot have resistance to, but they also can't be weak to. This makes it useful for enemies without weaknesses, and this special move also doesn't use MP, making it great for conserving MP in a long dungeon. To use this synthesis ability you need to have two allies in with the correct Archetypes. The first ally needs to be a Knight, Healer, or Commander, with the second ally using Thief, Faker, or Merchant.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Brawler, Merchant, Healer</h2><p dir="ltr">The Brawler, Merchant, and Healer combination gives you access to a couple of powerful Almighty attacks from the Merchant and several light attacks, as well. The Almighty attacks from the Merchant do cost money to use, but this means that they don't cost MP, a trade-off you might be willing to make late into Metaphor: ReFantazio. The powerful light attacks are great to have, since your options for high damage light attacks are fairly limited.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Whatever the information says</h2><p dir="ltr">For the majority of main and side dungeons in Metaphor: ReFantazio, you can purchase information about the monsters in each dungeon from an informant. This information usually tells you what the enemies' weaknesses are, but if you go to your requests list, it will also add a recommended Archetypes section to the description. These are always the best possible setups, especially since it usually only recommends a couple Archetypes and not a full party of four, but you will have access to most of the enemy weaknesses, making it a nice play to start if you aren't sure what party setup to go with.</p>

Valve’s affordable and portable handheld PC launched in 2022 and has quickly inspired imitators while also making it easier than ever to play new and old PC games while chilling on your couch. I know plenty of people who didn’t play many PC games who now play a ton of stuff on their Steam Deck. It’s not a debate. The Steam Deck was a big hit and has changed the video game industry. That said, in 2024, it feels like more and more of this year’s biggest games are just not running well, or running at all, on the aging Steam Deck. </p><p>The recently released<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remaster—which is very good—is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0e6k3/silent_hill_2_is_officially_non_supported_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0e6k3/silent_hill_2_is_officially_non_supported_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently marked by Valve as “Unsupported” on Steam Deck</a></span>. Though you can still install it and you’ll discover that you can play the new horror game, you’ll have to turn most settings down to low and put up with some wonky performance in certain areas. It’s pretty clear this game is pushing the Steam Deck. </p><p>And it’s not alone. Here are other games that, according to Valve’s testing, are either “Unsupported” or just “Playable” (as opposed to “Verified”) on Steam Deck:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Space Marine 2</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Hellblade 2 -</em> Unsupported</li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2 </em>- Unsupported</li><li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Frostpunk 2</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Final Fantasy 16</em> (PC Port) - Unsupported</li><li><em>Helldivers 2</em> - Playable</li><li><em>Tekken 8 </em>- Playable</li><li><em>WWE 2K24</em> - Playable</li><li><em>Suicide Squad </em>- Playable</li><li><em>Multiversus</em> - Playable </li></ul><p>Some of these games really struggle to run on Steam Deck. <em>Space Marine 2</em>, for example, can technically still be installed and played, but even with every setting turned down to its lowest option, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/X1uxvXEYgZc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/X1uxvXEYgZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it struggles to reach 30 FPS</a></span>. <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II,</em> which is a very pretty game, can only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Gl4iW-mhiSg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Gl4iW-mhiSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kind of run on the Steam Deck</a></span> after lowering the settings to the point where it looks awful. And then you have something like the massive open-world RPG that is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, which struggled on current-gen consoles, and unsurprisingly, plays quite poorly on Steam Deck. </p><p>Now, not all of the games above are completely unplayable. For example, with some tweaks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Op9CoNvRiVg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Op9CoNvRiVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get<em> Black Myth: Wukong </em>to run mostly fine at 30ish FPS</a></span> on Steam Deck. The same is true of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/A0xkICYpog0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/A0xkICYpog0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>But one of the best qualities of the Steam Deck is that many games are “Verified,” and just work great right out of the box on Valve’s tiny PC. Having to dig into multiple menus, tweak Steam Deck and game settings, and check online for recommendations isn’t much fun, and I imagine that for a lot of Steam Deck owners, it’s not something they want to mess with just to play a new game. </p><p>The reality is that the Steam Deck is getting old. It wasn’t the hottest or most powerful device around when it launched in 2022, so it’s not shocking that more and more games are struggling to run on the device. Sure, there are plenty of games that run perfectly on Steam Deck, so it’s still worth buying if you want to play indie games, older titles, or less demanding single-player experiences. </p><p>But the era of being able to run “most games” on Steam Deck, an early pitch Valve made with the device, has come to an end. And now the question is: When will Valve release a more powerful version of the Steam Deck that can play these bigger games without melting your battery or having to lower every setting?  </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The legendary map, which has found a place in every Black Ops game in one way or another, will appear on November 1, 2024. The return of this fan-favourite map was confirmed with a brief teaser trailer showcasing the instantly recognisable environment.</p>

<h2 id="h-timeless">Timeless</h2>



<p>Nuketown has existed since 2010’s Black Ops, and since then, it has popped up in every successful game in the Black Ops series. It’s returning in Black Ops 6, but it won’t be added to the game until one week after the title has been released. That means users will have seven days to bolster their loadouts before jumping into what will assumedly be a 24/7 rotation of Nuketown.</p>



<p>From the teaser that was posted on social media, Nuketown looks similar to past iterations, which isn’t the most typical way that the map has been handled in previous games. Traditionally, each game will offer a unique spin on the map, fitting it into their part of the timeline or setting, but Black Ops 6’s Nuketown doesn’t look too ‘special’ at first blush:</p>

<p>When Black Ops 6 is released, every map will be original, and the only maps that players will have any familiarity with will be the ones that cropped up in the beta that unravelled several weeks ago. It’s nice that Nuketown is making an appearance, as it’ll give players something comfortable to gravitate to.</p>

                <p>This week may be the best time to ever earn one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> most sought-after mounts, Invincible, the steed of the Lich King himself.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a mount so prestigious that many mount-collecting players run the 15-year-old Icecrown Citadel raid every week on multiple characters for a chance at earning the mount from the Lich King's corpse, usually to no avail.</p><p dir="ltr">But thanks to the Wrath of the Lich King Timewalking event running this week in The War Within, players on Reddit are reporting what seems like a much higher-than-normal chance of earning the mount. The prize is coming not from defeating the Lich King, but from the Cache of Timewarped Treasures quest reward earned by doing the Timewalking version of another Wrath of the Lich King raid, Ulduar.</p><p dir="ltr">To snag the quest, players need to travel to the Wrath of the Lich King version of Dalaran (easily accessible from each faction's portal room) and pick up the Disturbance Detected: Ulduar quest from the NPCs standing near the fountain with the statues. Players can then use the Group Finder function to find a group running the old raid. Thankfully, only the raid's final boss needs to be defeated for the quest, so players can actually skip most of the raid and run straight to Yogg-Saron to save time.</p><p dir="ltr">Players are sharing their success on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1g00lon/worth_doing_the_ulduar_timewalking_event_even_if/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WoW subreddit</a>. While it's unclear what exactly the drop rate for Invincible from the Cache of Timewarped Treasures is, it clearly seems to be much higher than defeating the Lich King like usual.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard recently announced The War Within's first major update, patch 11.0.5, will release on October 22. The update will introduce a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277"> huge WoW 20th-anniversary event</a>--one where players will be able to earn updated versions of some of the game's most iconic armor sets, complete Timewalking versions of old dungeons and raids, and more.</p>
