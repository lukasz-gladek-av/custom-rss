			<p>Red Dead Redemption may finally launch on PC 14 years after its original release, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported by Tez2 on<a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2"> X/Twitter</a>, a screenshot showing a code string mentioning the PC version of the popular Old West-themed open-world game released back in 2010 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is making the rounds online. As Tez2 has yet to mention where this string has been discovered, we must take this PC port rumor with a huge grain of salt until more info comes in. [<strong>Update</strong> - The strings were found in <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1790038268630663441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">Rockstar's launcher site file</a>.]</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like Rockstar is gearing up to release <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDR1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RDR1</a> on PC. <a href="https://t.co/2xMmpFIdCk">pic.twitter.com/2xMmpFIdCk</a></p>
<p>— Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790031522315026508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While this PC port of Red Dead Redemption has yet to be confirmed, it's not like Rockstar Games denied its game would never be released on PC. Following the release of an updated port on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick did not deny its existence, saying that any <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc/">game announcement is up to the developer</a>, suggesting that something was indeed in the works.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption is now available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch, as well as on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. We will let you know more about the rumored PC port as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
<p><em>When federal agents threaten his family, former outlaw John Marston is forced to hunt down the gang of criminals he once called friends. Experience Marston’s journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico as he fights to bury his blood-stained past in the critically acclaimed predecessor to the 2018 blockbuster, Red Dead Redemption 2. Also included is Undead Nightmare, the iconic horror story that transforms the world of Red Dead Redemption into an apocalyptic fight for survival against a zombie horde.</em></p>

      </div>
<p>Id Software developed 2020's Doom Eternal, the latest entry in the main series. The mobile game Mighty Doom released in 2023 and was made by Alpha Dog Games. Microsoft recently closed the studio as part of a wider shakeup. Mighty Doom will go offline in August.</p><p>In January this year, ZeniMax filed a trademark application for <a href="https://twitter.com/Odah_SFA/status/1747585089804832836" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"IDKFA,"</a> which is an <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_Cheat_Codes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic classic Doom cheat code.</a> Whether or not this is related to a new game announcement is unknown.</p><p>Doom Eternal had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/" data-ref-id="1900-6417432">positive critical reception</a> upon launch in 2020. It was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch consoles, as well as PC.

The latest episode of the GI Microcast is now available in podcast form, delivering your weekly dive into the biggest stories of the past week. The video will be available tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
This week, we take a quick dive in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">Xbox's closure of four Bethesda-owned studios</a>, as well as what this means for Microsoft's wider gaming strategy, the future of the smaller studios it still owns, and its reputation with the rest of the industry and gamers.
</p>
<p>

<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The last game we got in the <em>Doom</em> series was 2020’s <em>Eternal</em>. A fine game it was as well (though I personally prefer the 2016 entry). Given that it’s only been four years then, one would hardly expect a new installment so soon. We know how long AAA titles take to develop in this climate. However, something may be on the horizon soon.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Back in January of this year, <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98349237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax Media registered a trademark</a> that many interpreted as being <em>Doom</em> related. The trademark itself was given the title “IDKFA,” a well-known reference to a cheat code from the earlier games. Given this, many have assumed that this <em>has</em> to be in relation to an upcoming game.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a> also teased a <em>Doom </em>may be on the way in a recent write-up on what’s happening inside Microsoft and Xbox right now. “Microsoft will be banking on some new game announcements lifting the <em>Doom</em> around Xbox,” Warren writes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> also reports that it’s heard similar things.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">We have so few details about this speculation that I’m surprised I’m able to fill the required word count for this article (though I do waffle sometimes). As such, it can’t be said what ZeniMax has planned. All we can do is play the Speculation Game based on what people strongly suspect, given the <em>Doom</em> reference.</p> <h2 id="h-could-an-announcement-be-made-soon" data-injectable="false">Could an announcement be made soon?</h2> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Not long ago, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/">Xbox Showcase for 2024</a> was announced, which will be going ahead on June 9. This will be a chance for a lot of Xbox-related content to be shown off and teased. Seeing as id Software – the studio behind <em>Doom</em> – is part of this business umbrella, there’s every possibility a new game in the iconic series could be announced.</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">I’m spit-balling, of course. None of the official Twitter/X accounts from the likes of id, Bethesda, Xbox or even the <em>Doom</em> profile itself mention any kind of announcement inbound. Makes sense if they want to keep it schtum, though.</p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">We don’t even know if id Software will be the developer of any future <em>Doom</em> games. I mean, it would seem likely, given the studio has been making them since 1993 (albeit not with the same people onboard). But as I say, these are just rumors, so we’ll hopefully know more either during or just before the Xbox Showcase goes live.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">The showcase will be an important moment for Xbox either way, as the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-says-it-needs-smaller-prestigious-games-right-after-killing-the-studio-behind-the-small-prestigious-hi-fi-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faces scrutiny</a> for its recent closure of several studios, including Arkane Austin and Tango GameWorks. This summer’s stream will show what road Xbox has ahead without the makers of <em>Prey </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>on-board.</p>

<p data-characters="204" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Xbox Game Pass is like walking into a candy store. There are so many different options to choose from when it comes to its game selection, and some of the best games on Xbox Game Pass can be hard to spot.</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Some need acquired tastes like liquorice (<em>Dordogne),&nbsp;</em>while many others will enjoy a beloved, comfortable chocolate bar (<em>Minecraft).&nbsp;</em>However, there’s a good chance you’ll find something to sate your palette in Microsoft’s rolling digital library. Here are the 13 best games on Xbox Game Pass right now.</p> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">[<strong>Updated: May 2024]</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Skyrim-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Game Pass" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Skyrim-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Skyrim-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Skyrim-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Skyrim-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</em></h2> <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">Those seeking adventure should look towards&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.&nbsp;</em>This (take a deep breath) <em>12-year-old game</em> (breathe out) still has a fervent fanbase, and is still played to this day for good reason. There are many weapons, armor, spells, and even dragon shouts to find across the open world. There are also branching side quests that in and of themselves have deep, fascinating stories and characters behind them. You should take an arrow in the knee in this game and explore the grand landscapes of Skyrim with Xbox Game Pass. The Special Edition also comes with all of the DLC.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Halo-Infinite-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Halo Infinite best games on Xbox Game Pass" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Halo-Infinite-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Halo-Infinite-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Halo-Infinite-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Halo-Infinite-Game-Pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Xbox</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Halo Infinite</em></h2> <p data-characters="705" data-current-count="1005" data-injectable="true">In my opinion,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-halo-infinite-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halo Infinite</a>&nbsp;</em>gets way too much flak. This entry was my first step into the series, and I was floored by this sci-fi experience. Each weapon in Master Chief’s arsenal feels powerful, but in the frantic first-person shooter levels, you’re scrounging for whatever you can find, adding to the tension of battle. Finding improved weapons from the tough bosses you kill in the open world is gratifying, and the world itself truly grabbed me. The storyline with Master Chief saving the UNSC and the world on the brink is also thrilling to experience. The multiplayer, to me, feels dated with tired map design and modes, but the single-player campaign is the main attraction.</p>

It combines thrilling action combat with engaging music rhythm gameplay to create a unique melee-focused experience. You play as a unique, clumsy protagonist, trying to save the day from Vandelay Technologies’ evil leader. The slapstick is on point, and the script is laugh-out-loud hilarious. The action is also fantastic as you switch between the powers of your allies and string together combos on your foes.&nbsp; You also can’t forget the stand-out music selection in <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>with rock hits from Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, and The Black Keys. </p>

It’s a worldwide phenomenon for a reason as it allows players to build their own structures, craft their own items, and explore a randomly generated world. Building with your friends is a lot of fun, and many players have created amazing buildings throughout the years like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-meets-harry-potter-in-this-heartfelt-rpg-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hogwarts</a> from&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter.</em> Someone even made a working 3D <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-real-time-3d-graphing-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphing calculator</a>. This game is great for kids, as it lets them show their creative side and figure out how to build materials in the game. Despite existing for over a decade, the game is still getting updates and DLC based on <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mega-man-x-dlc-wall-kicks-into-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mega Man X</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-spongebob-squarepants-dlc-makes-a-splash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

Alongside your friends, you’re taking down monstrous beasts, collecting their materials, fur, etc, and then crafting incredible gear for your player. It’s a rewarding game loop that keeps you playing for hours on end.</p>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"> There’s a strategy to each battle, and you need to keep your wits about you to survive in some of these encounters. Ultimately, it’s <em>Monster Hunter’s</em> new maneuverability of the wirebugs that lets you zip from place to place like Indiana Jones’ whip that really made it click for me. You can also mount your pet palamute, letting you get to the battle quicker. It’s one of the best games on Xbox Game Pass because of how gratifying collecting resources and physically seeing your character getting stronger is.</p>

The rush of driving through its city streets brought me back to the days of <em>Underground 2,</em> and you can deeply customize your car, go on tough street races, and try to be the best in the city.</p>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">There’s also a unique anime-like art style, and cast members have a unique shader that makes them stand out.

 <h2 id="h-persona-3-reload" data-injectable="false"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">Atlus’ <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-persona-3-reload/">Persona 3 Reload </a></em>is a fantastic way to get into the series or continue your love for the JRPG franchise. It’s a complete remake of the PS2 gem that some fans argue is the best <em>Persona </em>game. Expect engaging turn-based combat revolving around collecting shadows, a provoking, dark story, and plenty of wonderful characters to meet along the way. The visual improvements are a stand-out with stunning UI and a complete uplift on the same level as <em>Persona 5 Royal. </em></p>

 <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">This game’s absolutely massive, taking place in a stunning Greek-inspired open world. You can tell Ubisoft did its research with the spectacular architecture and intriguing culture to be found in the game. Kassandra (one of the two possible playable characters) is one of the best protagonists in the series; she has spunk, charming humor, and an overall badassery that few other <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> heroes can match. The story also takes twists and turns you’ll find fascinating. Oh, and the combat’s thrilling with a deep customization system alongside it.</p>

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Ready or Not</em> made its 1.0 debut <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ready-or-not-1-0-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late in 2023</a> and established itself as a fairly decent, if sometimes flawed attempt at bringing the classic <em>SWAT</em> gameplay formula back into the limelight. One of its biggest problems was the twitchy, trigger-happy AI, and this is being reigned in very soon.</p> <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">While it is to be expected that <em>some</em> of the perpetrators present in <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s many missions would, indeed, be hyper-aggressive, the issue was that they all behaved like highly trained, laser-focused super-mercenaries rather than nervous armed civilians, which they often were. As the developer Void Interactive explains in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/4210378060872317425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its recent Steam blog</a>, this problem is being curtailed through the implementation of a “cone” visibility feature, which should make the whole thing feel much more believable and organic in gameplay.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Is Ready or Not on Xbox?" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure> <h2 id="h-ready-or-not-s-ai-is-getting-a-much-needed-detection-upgrade" data-injectable="false">Ready or Not’s AI is getting a much-needed detection upgrade</h2> <p data-characters="708" data-current-count="1008" data-injectable="true">One of the things that often played a role in making the AI feel downright unfair is <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s current viewing model: the parallel model. Here, <em>RoN</em>‘s AI tracks invisible traces from the NPCs’ eyes to the player character’s top and bottom of the head, the lower left arm, and the lower right arm. Whenever <em>any</em> of an armed AI’s traces would connect with two of the aforementioned player hotspots without any geometry blocking its field of vision, the AI would immediately react and be prepared for the player’s entry. This is particularly egregious when the AI “spots” the player through minute gaps in map geometry, leading to unfair encounters and deaths.</p>
 <p data-characters="630" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">The new cone model, on the other hand, solves this problem through a more granular handling of map geometry and the player vs AI positioning. Further, it also allows for a far more in-depth visibility system during gas grenade deployments. This, combined with a few notable aggression tweaks, such as the AI firing at the player’s last known location rather than tracking them through map geometry, makes for a substantially improved gameplay experience. At least, in theory, as all of these changes will only be implemented into <em>Ready or Not</em> with one of the future updates. Possibly <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ready-or-not-outlines-the-ominous-sounding-home-invasion-dlc-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming <em>Home Invasion</em> DLC</a>, perhaps.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">On top of discussing AI improvements, Void Interactive also used this opportunity to highlight the fact that May is the month of mental health awareness. The studio is going to be “bringing attention to Mental Health Awareness month by uploading videos which explore various concepts of mental health related to the themes present in <em>Ready or Not.</em>” The first video, titled <em>PTSD</em>, can be found below:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Ready or Not - Mental Health Awareness Month - PTSD" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIFg98i3MWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="false"><em>Ready or Not</em>‘s Commander Mode is meant to illustrate some of the problems that arise from dealing with SWAT situations in the real world. While the specifics of its handling of the subject matter are open to interpretation, Void Interactive’s intention is clear and pointed, and bringing more attention to mental health awareness is always a good thing.</p>

One of them is a blonde-haired woman, and the other’s a small child, and they can be found at the foot of a staircase in the northeastern part of the second floor. We’ve marked the general area on the map above, but the staircase is also near a Clockie statue, so keep an eye out for that. Listen in on the pair’s conversation about not being able to buy Robin’s new album, and a scalper will show up offering to sell it.</p>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">A dialogue prompt will soon pop up, and you’ll have one of two choices. You can either agree to the scalper’s offer and pay for the album, or you can rat them out to a nearby Bloodhound Family Member (they should be right behind you). </p> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="false">We recommend the latter simply because you should never pay scalpers for anything. Either way, you’ll receive not only the Hope is the Thing With Feathers record but a Sway to My Beat in Cosmos record, too. You can listen to both records to your heart’s content in the Astral Express by using the Phonograph.</p>

As someone who’s been out as trans for over 20 years, and making trans art for just as long, I tend to <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-the-last-of-us-part-2s-tran-1844245756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roll my eyes</a> at this, lamenting the ways it can limit the stories we tell. The film <em>I Saw The TV Glow </em>takes a moving, fraught approach to this problem, telling a hugely trans story without mentioning trans people at all.</p><p><em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> follows Owen, who begins the movie as a withdrawn 7th grader in 1996, when he meets 9th grade loner Maddy. The two bond over a TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, a <em>Buffy</em>-esque (down to the credits font) story of two girls who fight a monster of the week through a mystical connection on the astral plane. Owen drifts through childhood until the show is cancelled, when Maddy disappears. Then, Owen drifts through adulthood until Maddy suddenly reappears, with an outlandish story about their connection to <em>The Pink Opaque </em>and a frightening proposition for how they can rekindle it.&nbsp;</p><p>(I try to keep things vague from here on out to avoid spoilers, but it’s a bit inevitable in order to dig into <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em>, so let this be your <strong>spoiler warning</strong>.)</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I Saw The TV Glow | Official Trailer HD | A24" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kymDzCgPwj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s one reading of this movie as a movie about fandoms and young people finding themselves through media. If you grew up in the 90s, you’ll spot appearances from Amber Benson, who played Tara on <em>Buffy</em>, and the stars from <em>The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete</em>; at the theater I saw the movie in, trailers for these shows played before the lights went down. Director Jane Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “I think a lot of my own mythology, of my childhood and coming of age, was created by a lot of those shows.” <em>The Pink Opaque</em> brings Maddy and Owen together, and shapes the course of Maddy’s life, at least, in major ways. In adulthood, it remains a place Owen escapes to, though it loses some of its luster over time. <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> wonderfully uses <em>The Pink Opaque </em>as a focal point without over-explaining the show, giving you enough glimpses to understand it while letting you fill in the gaps with whatever your childhood obsession of choice was.&nbsp;</p><p>A movie about realizing things about yourself through childhood nerd culture would be a fine movie, and I think it’s a fine way to read <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em>. But another reading of the movie is that Owen is trans, and also there’s a TV show, and the two don’t have all that much to do with each other. It’s fairly obvious–or maybe obvious if you’re trans–that Owen is not a cis guy, and the entire movie is just about him either not realizing it or not dealing with it. (I tried to write this piece without using pronouns, but it got clunky, and given that Owen never makes overtures toward any other pronouns, it doesn’t feel wrong to use “he,” though it doesn’t feel quite right either.) Whatever gender stuff Owen has going on is shoved so far down that he can only acknowledge it as a howling, empty void inside, and not looking at that void infuses every aspect of his life. </p><p>I don’t think he’s entirely ignorant of it; at one point, when he asks his dad if he can stay up late to watch <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, his dad remarks that it’s a show for girls. When Maddy asks him about his sexuality and he says “I think I like TV shows,” I didn’t think he looked confused about himself as much as so intentional about keeping all his desires at bay that he doesn't even know what they are. There’s a scene where he’s wearing a strappy top, possibly a dress, though it wasn’t clear to me if it was a flashback or a fantasy. I read adult Maddy’s offer to reconnect to the show as an invitation to Owen to transition, or at least finally look at the possibility of being trans, or at least stop living the repressed, miserable life he makes no efforts to escape.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A shot from The Pink Opaque. Credit: A24</figcaption></figure><p>As a trans viewer, <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> feels like a very trans movie, despite the fact that it never once mentions trans people. But it’s not a story about transitioning, the primary story trans people were allowed to tell about ourselves for so long that <em>not</em> telling it <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/27/the-invention-of-the-trans-novel-imogen-binnie-nevada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaped my career</a>. Instead, it’s an intensely emotional look at <em>not</em> transitioning; at telling yourself it’s impossible even when you can see that it isn’t, because you think it’s just impossible <em>for you</em>; at what choosing that path feels like and where it leads. Nothing, even Maddy’s reappearance or the TV show that matters <em>so much </em>to them, can really get through the static of the unspoken that overwhelms Owen’s life. Through that lens, <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is almost incidental to the story–it’s worth noting that I didn’t catch anything explicitly queer or trans about the show, or even an in-depth explanation of what Maddy and Owen like about it so much. I think this is a good choice on director Schoenbrun’s part; it keeps the movie from drifting into nerdcore, and it also avoids what I see as a common pitfall of “this piece of media made me realize I’m trans” stories, which can give the media in question (usually made by cis people) too much power over trans people's imaginations. <em>The Pink Opaque</em> doesn’t teach Owen anything about himself or his gender; unlike Maddy, who he watches cry during their viewing nights, it’s just another thing his repression keeps him from touching.</p><p>But again, the movie never talks about any of this. <em>I Saw The TV Glow </em>and Schoenbrun’s previous film, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4s7v7djmBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We’re All Going To The World’s Fair</a></em>, received <a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/arts-entertainment/trans-filmmaker-explores-dysphoria-through-internet-horror-in-were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-21569357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">praise</a> for being adjacent-to-the-mainstream films with trans themes by a trans director. <em>I Saw The TV Glow </em>is distributed by A24; at <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/jane-schoenbrun/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paste</a>, reviewer Leigh Monson praised the movie for this, writing, “A transgender filmmaker laying bare these specific emotions for a general audience to empathize with is undoubtedly a cause for celebration” and noting that “the relative high profile of <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> makes it something of a unicorn.”&nbsp;</p><p>But because of this profile, I can’t help wondering what it means that we have a mainstream-ish trans film that never actually <em>says</em> the word “trans.” It asks trans viewers to do the work that we did in all that media of our childhoods, reading too much into subtext and giving the film meaning by heaping our own lives on top of it. As a commentary on the necessity of that, especially in the 90s, it’s an artful choice, and to be clear I think the movie would lose all of its power if it made transness explicit. But as someone who sometimes lies awake at night wondering what my career might have looked like if everything I wrote and staged and edited wasn’t so fucking trans, whose undergrad advisor at a prestigious playwriting school told him “No one wants to see that pervert shit” and demanded I write something else when I brought in a thesis play starring trans characters, I can’t help but wonder if the silent presence of transness is part of what makes the movie able to enter the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A24</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ll let me sound like a cranky old man for a second: everyone’s transition is their own, and there’s no timeline for coming out, and no one way to be trans. But I’ve always looked a little askance–or if I’m being really honest, jealously–at celebrities like Elliot Page or the Wachowskis who came out later in life, who became mouthpieces for the trans community by virtue of already having mouthpieces. The ethics of being out have shifted radically during my lifetime, but I still have a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_Nation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queer Nation</a> roots to my politics that causes me to read the closet, at least in some instances, as a place of power. And you could argue that we see that in Owen’s life, especially when held up against what Maddy tells him about her own. He isn’t <em>happy</em>–he probably isn’t even in touch enough with his own emotions to be miserable–but his closeted adulthood (if you could call it closeted) has a kind of coherence, and an anemic version of safety, that it seems Maddy’s life lacks. When I let myself read <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> as a closeted movie about a closeted person, or even as a trans movie that still primarily focuses on the question of transition but just doesn’t call it “transition,” it can feel less like something to celebrate.</p><p>But these critiques were just some of the million thoughts that went through my head after seeing the movie, and they're less critiques and more a sign of how many readings the movie supports. If you take cis people’s distribution channels and ticket sales out of it, if you look at it as a story by a trans director that takes trans people as its audience, the movie is a ferocious gut punch, and it would absolutely be lesser if it made its trans content spoken or explicit. Its silence is so loud, Owen’s lack of feeling so emotional, that it couldn’t be the moving, unique story it is any other way.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> is getting a wider release this week; I’m excited for more of my trans friends to see it so we can talk about it, and for more of my cis friends to see it so I can find out how it read to them. (Also, given Schoenbrun’s previous movie: if you, like me, are worried it’s scary, it isn’t.) Maybe it’s a trans movie infiltrating the mainstream in the Trojan horse guise of 90s nostalgia; maybe it’s two movies, one for cis people and one for trans people. Whatever it is, it’s definitely worth seeing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">New The Rogue Prince of Persia Release Date Revealed</a> - Joseph Allen</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Empire and Ubisoft have announced the new&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>release date, and the roguelite platformer is landing at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Last week, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rogue-prince-of-persia-delayed-hades-2">delayed the upcoming game</a> in order to avoid clashing with Supergiant's&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now">launched without warning last Monday</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, though, Evil Empire says&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>will launch on May 27th, which the developer says should give people time to play&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>"and the other great games that came out last week" (which include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-well"><em>Animal Well</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crow Country</em>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=JoxYxSqV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=9R3L_jtR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c84bd3c4-f408-4570-ad70-29def8f6b5ab" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=9R3L_jtR" alt="The Prince dashing across a platform in The Rogue Prince of Persia" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>has settled on a new release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Evil Empire also says it'll "keep adding polish" to&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>in the interim, too. Rather amusingly, the dev says it's "burning the whole thing down" if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>&nbsp;</em>shadow-drops before the new release date. I think that's unlikely, guys.</p>
<p>As well as the new release date, Evil Empire has also announced&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>'s pricing, and it's not quite as expensive as some have apparently been making it out to be.</p>
<p>According to Evil Empire, some have speculated the price of the game could be anywhere from $30 to $60. The latter seems like a pretty ridiculous guess to me, and apparently to Evil Empire as well, because&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>will be priced at $19.99, with a launch discount to boot.</p>
<p>To tide you over until the game's release, a new gameplay trailer has also been released, and it features the game's theme song, too. Check it out.</p>

<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite platformer developed by&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>co-dev studio Evil Empire and published by&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>IP holder Ubisoft.</p>
<p>It features a stylized aesthetic and fast-paced action-platforming gameplay not a million miles away from&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells</em>, complete with plenty of weapons and skills to unlock as you play.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 27th. Be sure to check out our very own Andrew Stretch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise">preview of the game</a> to see what you're in for, too.</p>

            <p>This news post leaves me in a quandary, readers, because I will need to write a swear word for the sake of full journalistic transparency, but Google’s algorithms tend to frown on sweary articles. On the other hand, Google’s algorithms don’t like it when you spend whole intros handwringing about Google’s algorithms, either, so let’s stop, er, faffing around and speak of Doom. Id Software parent company Zenimax recently <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/983/49/idkfa-98349237.html">trademarked</a> “IDKFA”, a string of letters that will be of deep significance to original Doom players, and which may therefore be evidence of an impending announcement.</p><!--more-->
<p>IDKFA is – cover your ears, Google! - short for I Don’t Know Fuck All. It’s an ancient cheatcode that unlocks all the game’s weapons and grants you megaarmour. It being somewhat of a retro insider term bodes well, I guess, for anybody fearful that their next helping of id Software’s demon-melching series will be some kind of ultra-modernised F2P affair or similar.</p>
<p>Zenimax’s trademark covers “downloadable computer game software via a global computer network and wireless devices” and “downloadable computer game software for personal computers and home video game consoles”. Seems pretty cut-and-dried, though again in the interests of full journalistic transparency, I should add that it also covers “scientific, nautical, surveying, electric, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling, checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments”. So this could be a new Doom game, or it could be some kind of Doom diving bell. They really are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious">putting Doom on everything these days</a>.</p>
<p>“Doom: Year Zero” was among the games mentioned in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">a Microsoft presentation from July 2020</a> that leaked online last year as part of Microsoft's legal tussle with the US Federal Trade Commission over the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Eurogamer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls%E2%80%9D">have heard</a> that a Doom announcement is forthcoming at this year’s Summer Games Fest in June.</p>
<p>In other news, Zenimax parent Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">recently closed Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a>, a development that probably has every other Microsoft-owned developer of games that aren't Call Of Duty sweating in their boots. Id seem relatively secure against wider corporate “optimisation” or “repositioning”, given their outsized reputation and the success of the last couple of Doom reboots – Doom Eternal made half a billion dollars in its opening nine months. But this being Microsoft in 2024, who knows?</p>

			<p>Even if a small fraction of the leaked GTA 6 World Events gets implemented in the game's final version, they promise to shake up the open-world experience of the latest entry in the series considerably.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RedBanditGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedBandit</a> shared on YouTube a very interesting video analyzing some of the game's leaked World Events, what they could involve, and even where they may take place on the map, using the Map Project as a reference. While RedBandit is mostly speculating, some of his takes sound extremely reasonable, considering past entries in the series, so hopefully, the final game's events will be as varied and interesting as the YouTuber speculates.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 Leaked World Events are Amazing!

<p>Following the release of GTA 6's reveal trailer, Rockstar Games has been silent regarding one of the most anticipated games of all time, but more on the game could be coming soon. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-new-screenshots/">Last week</a>, the game's Official Website was updated with new placeholders for screenshots, suggesting new information could be inbound.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently in development for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S and should be release in 2025 worldwide. We will let you know more about the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Mark Hamill's back as the Joker in MultiVersus</a> - Michael McWhertor</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="nvOTiA">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/4/3/18294361/joker-origin-movie-dc-comics-joaquin-phoenix">Joker</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/9/13/23345074/multiversus-opinion-dodge-cooldown-meter-ui-player-first-games"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros">the fighting game’s relaunch later this month</a>, and actor Mark Hamill will reprise his role as the Clown Prince of Crime for the occasion. Developer Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games showed off Joker in a new gameplay trailer that contains another fun surprise: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/11/18/18099202/powerpuff-girls-20-rowdyruff-boys">The Powerpuff Girls</a> are coming to <em>MultiVersus</em> as well.</p>
<p id="yvvZb3">While we don’t get to see Buttercup, Blossom, and Bubbles in action, the Powerpuff Girls are teased within the first few seconds of Monday’s trailer for Joker. Presumably, they’ll fight as a team, à la <em>MultiVersus</em>’ clever take on Tom and Jerry, but we’ll have to wait for the girls’  full reveal to know for sure.</p>
<p id="CHo73c">The Joker’s a Mage-class character in <em>MultiVersus</em> terms, meaning he’s more of a ranged fighter who relies on weapons and gadgets to deal damage. In Joker’s case, he’ll join the roster armed with a pogo stick, spring-loaded boxing gloves, a rocket launcher, balloons, and cartoonish cannons. His first gameplay trailer also shows off some alternate looks, including Dark Prince Charming and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2017/11/15/16655042/batman-who-laughs-origin-issue">Batman Who Laughs</a>.</p>
<p id="xDpVhQ">Hamill’s return to the Joker role reunites him with his <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23328910/batman-the-animated-series-btas-cartoon-essay"><em>Batman: The Animated Series</em></a> co-star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23453290/batman-kevin-conroy-actor-obituary">Kevin Conroy</a>, who voiced <em>MultiVersus</em>’ version of the Caped Crusader. Hamill never really stepped away from his version of Joker, voicing him in recent animated features and video games like <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em> and <em>Lego DC Super-Villains</em>. (Hamill did not provide the voice for the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24047250/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-joker-elseworlds">new, younger, alternate-universe Joker</a> in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115481/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-joker-story-unlock-controversy">recent <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> update</a>.)</p>
<p id="bw8TSl"><em>MultiVersus</em> will return on May 28. The game has been offline for close to a year as developer Player First worked to retool the Smash Bros.-inspired brawler and create new content for it.</p>
<p id="6JolcI">Joker will join a roster that also includes DC’s Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, and Black Adam; Scooby-Doo’s Shaggy and Velma; Looney Tunes’ Bugs Bunny, Tasmanian Devil, and Marvin the Martian; <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ Arya Stark; Tom and Jerry; <em>Adventure Time</em>’s Finn the Human and Jake the Dog; Steven Universe and Garnet; Iron Giant; <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>’s LeBron James; Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith; <em>Gremlins</em>’ Gizmo and Stripe; and <em>MultiVersus</em>’ original character Reindog.</p>

            <p>Plenty of <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> readers are familiar with the concept of crowdfunding, with well over a decade of Kickstarter campaigns helping to bring many a game to market. Less common, however, is equity crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Via the website StartEngine, Frost Giant Studios launched a campaign earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/frost-giant-asks-players-to-invest-in-studio">enables players to buy shares in the company</a> with the promise of (hopefully) sharing in its long-term success.</p>
<p>The campaign aims to raise between $15,000 and $5 million, and at the time of writing it's approaching the $1 million milestone. We caught up with CEO Tim Morten, who tells us equity crowdfunding is essentially a way to help the studio to self-publish its debut game, free-to-play real-time strategy outing Stormgate.</p>
<p>"We explored various options for publishing Stormgate, and I think maybe from an outside perspective, developing and publishing kind of get lumped together in people’s minds, but they’re very different activities," Morten explains. "Building the game involves a team of developers, engineers, designers, artists, producers. Publishing a game is really a marketing activity. And so, when we built the company, we built the company primarily to develop the product, with the thought that we’ll figure out how we’re going to go to market, self-publish, or with a publisher, later on.</p>

<p>"Now that early access is approaching this summer, it was time for us to make that decision, and we really wanted to be able to make our own decisions with respect to the design and also the launch of the product. And working with a publisher, as much as they bring a lot of marketing expertise and marketing capital, you give up some of that agency. So, really, the StartEngine campaign, the stock offering that we are making, is about enabling Frost Giant to retain its own decision-making and bring Stormgate to market with our vision, instead of giving up some of that power to a publisher."</p>
<p>It's worth making clear that this is not the only source of funding Frost Giant has tapped into. Since Morten <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/blizzard-vets-form-frost-giant-studios">co-founded the studio in 2020</a> with fellow Blizzard alumni Tim Campbell, the team has secured $34.7 million in Seed and Series A funding. Investors include Riot Games, Bitkraft, Kakao Games, 1up Ventures and Griffin Gaming Partners, among others.</p>
<p>The studio also successfully completed another crowdfunding campaign, with the Kickstarter for Stormgate raising $2.4 million from over 28,000 backers. Since Frost Giant has already secured a significant amount of funding — including from the public — is it hard to ask players to invest further into the company?</p>
<p>"The reality is that big games that get made today are spending in excess of $100 million. So, for us to go up against AAA games, for us to be a game that really stands as the next-generation RTS of the coming years, it does require a lot of investment," Morten says.</p>
<p>"We’ve raised just under $35 million to date — that’s a big number, but it’s a much smaller number than most AAA games actually deploy against building their products. And we are really fortunate to be in a position that we got the funding that we need to get to our early access launch, but we want to launch strongly, and we want to launch in a way that puts us at the same level as AAA games from other publishers.</p>
<p>"So, if there’s a playerbase out there that supports that, this is an opportunity for them to be a part of our success. And really, we’ve been very gratified by the support that we’ve seen from the community so far."</p>
<p>Frost Giant was formed after Campbell finished his work directing InXile Entertainment's Wasteland 3. Morten and Campbell gathered a core team of fellow former StarCraft 2 developers and began work on their own SnowPlay technology as well as a game to be built upon it.</p>
<blockquote><p>"This wave of venture-backed companies predicates approaching things in a new way. This is pioneering the way that games get financed"</p></blockquote>
<p>Morten adds that Frost Giant was fortunate to be looking for investment around the time that venture funding in video games was starting to ramp up in 2018 to 2019. He estimates the Stormgate studio was one of the first companies in that wave of venture-backed studios, and so far he believes the model has many advantages over seeking a publishing deal or bootstrapping as other independent developers need to do.</p>
<p>"This is a way for us to have a good budget, but still also have agency over what we’re building," he says. "I do think that this wave of venture-backed companies predicates approaching things in a new way. This is pioneering the way that games get financed."</p>
<p>The funding landscape is more challenging than ever. In recent months, we've seen studios such as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/die-gute-fabrik-halts-production">Die Gute Fabrik</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keoken-interactive-lays-off-team-after-failing-to-find-funding-at-gdc">Keoken Interactive</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paladin-studios-shuts-down-after-nearly-19-years">Paladin Studios</a> close their doors due to lack of funding. Morten recognises how tough it is out there, but seems confident that things will turn around again.</p>
<p>"Last year, there was a large contraction in the amount of venture funding that went into games and, frankly, into the amount of venture funding that got deployed at all as a result of higher interest rates, and macroeconomic conditions in general," he says. "That certainly changed the thinking of a lot of founders in terms of making more strategic partnerships, doing more publishing deals, and in our case, partnering with the community to still have strong launches for products. I do think that it’s a bit of a pendulum swing.</p>
<p>"COVID created a lot of over-expectations for the industry. The pendulum kind of swung back to correct. Certainly, those macroeconomic conditions like interest rates are still correcting. So, I do expect the pendulum to keep swinging, and for there to be something of an increase again in deployment of venture capital, but right now is a period where there’s a 75% to 85% contraction in terms of the amount of capital that venture is deploying."</p>

</figure>
<p>For now, Frost Giant is focused primarily on the development of Stormgate. Morten tells us the Kickstarter campaign alone tells the studio it's on the right track with a real-time strategy game, pointing to how the genre has seen very little disruption over the past decade.</p>
<p>"It’s been our belief from even before we started Frost Giant that RTS has a huge audience of people who love it, who have just not had big new content to play," he says. "Microsoft is still making Age of Empires games, and those are wonderful. Sega is still making Total War and Company of Heroes games, and those are wonderful.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We’ve raised just under $35 million to date — that’s a big number, but it’s a much smaller number than most AAA games"</p></blockquote>
<p>"But for the players who played Blizzard's RTS games, or even the Command &amp; Conquer series… there hasn’t been a big new release since 2010 when StarCraft II came out. So that pent-up demand for new content and for a new original game is substantial, and I believe the Kickstarter validates that."</p>
<p>Frost Giant isn't aiming to make a real-time strategy game that harks back to the good 'ol days; instead, it's boldly claiming Stormgate will represent the next generation for the genre. This stems from a mix of factors; for one thing, Frost Giant is placing a lot more emphasis on approachability, making it easier to construct buildings or units without having to click on the relevant structure or a worker unit. It is also focusing more on teamwork — you can even play the main campaign as a group of three — following how other genres have evolved in recent years.</p>
<p>"We've been very careful to retain the one-versus-one experience and the solo campaign experience that core RTS players have loved throughout the whole time of the genre," he assures. "But looking at all of the other genres — from MOBA to team shooters — there are just so many different emergences of team-based gameplay. And we really believe that games that are more social encourage you to have relationships with your friends online, as much as in person, and that’s a great addition to games."</p>
<p>He adds that the approachability improvements also play a role here: "It’s possible to come into the game as a new player with your friends who are more experienced players, and on the fly, get a tutorial from the game, so that you can join them, and right away have that social experience, but still get enough orientation that you know what you’re doing on the map."</p>
<p>Stormgate will be a free-to-play title, but while it may sound like Morten and his team primarily specialised in premium games in the past, he adds that they have specific experience that lends well to what they're attempting with this new game.</p>
<p>"We were incredibly fortunate to be involved in the transition of StarCraft II from premium to free-to-play in 2017, and we got to try different things with that highly engaged tail player base for StarCraft II, to understand what types of content resonated with those players," Morten explains.</p>
<p>"Our motivation at that point was twofold. We wanted to bring more players into the ecosystem by taking away price as a barrier to entry, but we also wanted to continue to support the game in a way that didn’t require players to wait two years between updates. So, it really was adapting StarCraft to more of a live service model, which indeed is the inspiration for what we’re doing with Stormgate."</p>

</figure>
<p>The StarCraft transition taught the Frost Giant team that three types of content were particularly popular with players: continuing the campaign, new heroes for the co-op mode, and cosmetics.</p>
<blockquote><p>"[We adapted] StarCraft to more of a live service model, which indeed is the inspiration for what we’re doing with Stormgate"</p></blockquote>
<p>"Each of those were almost equally popular. Different player segments attached to those different types of content. So, we had that chance to validate, what are the things that players really enjoy?</p>
<p>"In a lot of ways, it’s taking content that we used to bundle all up in a big box, and just making it a la carte for players to choose, what’s the type of content that they want to spend on, so that they don’t have to spend for everything? And that really seemed to be well-received by the StarCraft audience, and so we’ve used that as our inspiration for Stormgate."</p>
<p>Having released a popular demo during February's Next Fest, Frost Giant is gearing up to launch Stormgate in Early Access this summer. There's no specific roadmap for how long it will be before the game fully launches — that will depend on the feedback from the community — but Morten concludes that there are plenty of success stories to take examples from.</p>
<p>"Looking at Baldur’s Gate 3, I think Larian is kind of the poster child for what a great early access programme looks like. They spent multiple years. I think in our case, we would expect to spend at least a year, but exactly how long we spend remains to be determined."</p>

 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">So far, this is the only use for the Eerie Building Blocks, which means you’ll have plenty left over if you decide to complete every Dream Ticker Puzzle.

It's mostly bug fixes and translation changes. Full patch notes can be found here: <a href="https://t.co/6swG6nJhdY">https://t.co/6swG6nJhdY</a><br>Console and mobile ports are still in progress, thank you again for your continued patience!</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1783944693434486794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">However, many will be wondering where version 1.6 is or how far along it’s come. PC players are already on 1.6.6, which means if you’re on another platform, you’re already several versions behind.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Where is the Stardew Valley 1.6 console update? </h2> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">When the latest update for PC went live on April 26, Barone linked to the patch notes, which outlined the additional changes and bug fixes that had been implemented. Along with this, there was a clear message that the “console and mobile ports are still in progress,” with a thank-you message to those who have been patient.</p>
 <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="197" data-injectable="false">This appears to be the last time the developer spoke about the update on non-PC systems. As a result, it’s impossible to know at what stage it’s at or when it’s likely to release.</p> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="false">It’s also important to know that Barone has been pretty forthcoming in telling fans that patience is needed regarding updates and new content. As it stands, version 1.6 is in the pipeline for console and mobile versions of <em>Stardew Valley</em>. It’s just a case of waiting. However, I am going to go ahead and assume it’ll be v.1.6.x by the time it’s released, putting it on par with PC.</p>

<p>In a post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472361720259" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam page</a>, Deep Field says&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>has hit 250,000 sales within its first "eight days" on release, although the developer's math is a little skewed, it seems.</p>
<p>The post is dated today, May 13th, but&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>launched on May 2nd, which is a difference of eleven days, not eight. One wonders if this news was originally supposed to be released this past Friday, which would make the numbers check out.</p>

<p>Deep Field and Playstack say they're excited to share their plans for&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>for the rest of the year with players, and indeed, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4140568465023404413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty packed roadmap</a> for the game, including updates like a sandbox mode, new sectors, and much more.</p>
<p>If things continue the way they've been going, then there will be plenty of players in the&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>player base to share in the journey with Deep Field and Playstack.</p>

            <p>
The former lead writer of charming super-fascist simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is working on a strategy and tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in the vein of Nintendo and Intelligent System's Fire Emblem games, which aren't available on PC and as such, are a complete mystery to you, a lifelong desktop warrior who would sooner cut their hand off than suffer it to brush against one of those filthy Nintendo witches, I mean Switches. 
</p>
<p>
To fill you in, Fire Emblem is known and sort of celebrated for being a rich ensemble fantasy story with character permadeath. Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that's what. Beyond that, we can only dream.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We just decided to spin off into our own company and we're making a tactics strategy RPG like Fire Emblem," the aforesaid lead writer, Russ Nickel, comments in <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/helldivers-2-lead-writer-interview-russ-nickel">a recent chat with the Inverse</a>. "But it's very narrative-heavy, so Fire Emblem if it were published by Annapurna. So a deeply indie, emotionally poignant tactics game, that's also of course very funny with character-based comedy."
</p>
<p>
Nickel didn't go into huge depth about the game, which seemingly isn't yet titled and doesn't have a publisher, but he did add that it's important that the story and mechanics support each other - and that the resulting mixture owes something to his own struggles with OCD.
</p>
<p>
"The idea was the medium has to reflect the narrative and vice versa," he went on. "Helldivers 2 does a really good job of that. But for a tactics game, what does that really entail? It's so much thinking, so much moving the pieces to be this master chess player."
</p>
<p>
"I'm someone who has OCD that I'm very medicated for, so I'm like an extreme perfectionist, and I'm constantly fighting against my perfectionism. So I thought a tactics game could be really cool because you're constantly trying to do the exact right formulating with all your pieces. So just like a silly little example, in the game when you replay a battle you can't just hit replay battle, because what does that even mean? Those people are already dead. That doesn't make any sense. 
</p>
<p>
"So what replaying a battle actually is, after the battle, it's the main character just sitting at camp being like 'Oh my God, what did I do wrong? I messed that up so bad, can I do better?' The whole thing is about perfectionism, OCD, and overthinking, and maybe learning that that's not quite so good." 
</p>
<p>
I look forward to laying eyes on the game - it certainly sounds like it's trying to do a lot of different things at once. It's of course worth noting here that while Helldivers 2 isn't an RPG, its approach to live-service programming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-human-game-masters-who-tweak-your-co-op-fights-in-real-time">takes hefty inspiration from table-top roleplaying</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-open-world-60-fps/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Nintendo Switch New Extreme Overclocking Test Shows How Most Open-World Games Can Run at 60 FPS on the System</a> - Francesco De Meo</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch seems to be leaving quite a bit of performance on the table at its vanilla clock speeds, judging from a new overclocking test video shared online.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a>, highlights how the vast majority of open-world games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, The Witcher 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Assassin's Creed 3, and Hogwarts Legacy benefit from faster CPU and GPU clock speeds, all managing to run at around 60 FPS and with some graphics mods to boot. Even more linear games greatly benefit from faster CPU and GPU clock speeds, such as Dark Souls Remastered and Bayonetta 3, especially the latter, as the game's performance is all over the place on the base system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch EXTREME Overclocking - 16 Games Tested (Graphics Mods + 60FPS)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWLThF5Aus0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given its much better specs and NVIDIA DLSS support, the Nintendo Switch's successor likely won't have the same performance troubles for demanding games, such as open-world titles. And even if the system struggles to keep steady 60 FPS in certain titles, there's a good chance that players with VRR displays will still have a decent gaming experience, as the upcoming system may support 40 FPS modes, judging from some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-120-hz-mode/">recent findings.</a></p>
<p>No matter what, it is undeniable that the Nintendo Switch left a lasting impact on the gaming industry as a whole, spearheading a new generation of gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally. While its successor is said to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/">"conservative hardware evolution,</a>" it will likely have no trouble becoming as successful as its illustrious predecessor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155266/square-enix-multiplatform-final-fantasy-7-rebirth" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Square Enix is going 'aggressively' multiplatform after string of PS5 exclusives</a> - Oli Welsh</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="6SdaP2">Square Enix has revealed a new business plan — titled “Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens” — that will see the publisher “aggressively pursue” a multiplatform strategy for its biggest games across Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows PC.</p>
<p id="Pz5tuO">While Square Enix has long been active across a wide range of platforms, it has a tradition of signing exclusivity deals for its biggest releases, typically with Sony. This year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078968/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em></a> and last year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23767374/final-fantasy-16-review-ff16-new-game-plus"><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></a> are currently exclusive to PlayStation 5, while games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23564015/forspoken-review-ps5-release-date-demo-square-enix-pc-specs-system-requirements"><em>Forspoken</em></a><em> </em>and the original <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> have been released across PlayStation and PC. <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24079188/xbox-open-beta-requirements-limitations-free-trial">only just seen an Xbox release</a> this past March, over a decade after it debuted on PC and PlayStation.</p>
<p id="puhVmt">The wording of <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20240513_01_en.pdf">Square Enix’s new plan</a>, released as part of the company’s <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/24q4earnings.pdf">latest financial report</a>, suggests that this strategy will soon be a thing of the past. Square Enix said its goal was to “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles,” especially regarding “major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles.” The mention of “catalog titles” suggests that previously exclusive games, like the Final Fantasy 7 series and <em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, may soon be coming to other platforms.</p>
<p id="MHKmPr">The move comes after reports suggested that both <em>FF16 </em>and <em>FF7 Rebirth</em> underperformed financially. Indeed, in its own report, Square Enix acknowledges “low profitability” in what it calls the “HD games” segment — meaning medium- to big-budget games for console systems and PC — which is an alarming thing to say about the financial year in which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24086441/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sony-layoffs-death-of-aaa">these two perceived juggernauts</a> in the company’s most famous franchise were released.</p>
<p id="1YupqO">Of course, Square Enix is not the only company wondering if platform exclusivity can work at all at scale anymore. Xbox has begun a controversial shift toward publishing its games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">on rival console platforms</a>, while Sony is in the process of discovering the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24077268/helldivers-2-week-2-steam-record-balance-patch-defend">huge audience</a> (as well as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150011/helldivers-2-playstation-psn-linking-policy-revoked">potential pitfalls</a>) that can it can find as a multiplatform publisher with <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Square Enix’s language about finding a wider audience for its games echoes that used by Microsoft to defend its own decision.</p>
<p id="P5dBmR">Other points in Square Enix’s plan — which covers the period from now through March 2027 — include a “shift from quantity to quality” from a publisher that has been known to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23374590/square-enix-fall-2022-preview-crisis-core-final-fantasy-7-harvestella-nier">flood the market with smaller releases</a>. Quality’s great, of course, but the plan to “regularly release AAA titles in [Square Enix’s] major franchises” sounds a little like the risk aversion and sequelitis that has set in at every major game publisher. Square Enix said it had canceled several games that did not fit its new strategy.</p>
<p id="a4gVmB">In addition, Square Enix said that it aims to concentrate on in-house development and restructure its internal studios, or “business units,” to be more integrated — suggesting that the company’s long era of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23882020/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-hands-on-preview">fiefdoms led by powerful individual producers</a> with big personalities may be coming to an end. Reports have suggested that the current setup can be disorganized and frustrating for employees, but there’s no doubt that it also leads to games with a strong personal flavor. Whether or not Square Enix can keep the “balance between the creativity of its individual employees and the management centered on the organization,” as it says it intends to, will be key.</p>
<p id="OoeV5C">Overall, the business plan paints a picture of a company in crisis mode seeking to reboot itself — and of a game industry where AAA budgets and platform exclusivity just don’t mix anymore.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-of-us-fans-concerned-about-leaked-season-2-set-shots.869208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-fans-concerned-set-shots/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Last of Us Fans Concerned About Leaked Season 2 Set Shots</a> - Grant Taylor-Hill</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recently, some sneaky images from the set of The Last of Us season two were revealed online, drawing immediate concern from the franchise’s fanbase. In these leaked shots, we see Bella Ramsay in character as Ellie, the co-lead character in the series (alongside Pedro Pascal’s Joel). </p>



<p>The concern comes from the fact that Bella Ramsay hasn’t ‘aged up’ enough to realistically portray Ellie as she exists in The Last of Us Part II (2020), given that a substantial time jump takes her from being  14 to 19 between the two games.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-problem">That’s a Problem</h2>



<p>Bella Ramsay naturally looks very young for her age (20), and she was relatively perfect in the first season of the show, which was so good it picked up a few Emmy Awards and a BAFTA. However, her youthful visage is proving to be a letdown for some fans eager to see how the second season of the show will unfold. </p>



<p>In terms of the <strong>game</strong>, The Last of Us Part II was infinitely grittier and more intense than the first outing. Ellie had grown up and was vengeful, brutal, and determined, stopping at nothing to cut down those in her way. She’d aged noticeably too, with the stresses of post-apocalyptic life perhaps making her look older than her 19 years.</p>



<p>Bella Ramsay, <a href="https://twitter.com/DomTheBombYT/status/1789803535531421925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from the recently leaked set photos</a>, still looks like a young teenager.  </p>



<p>Some fans have stressed that Ellie should have been recast to recognise the time skip, and the consensus is that while she’s a fantastic actor, she’s no longer ‘right’ for the role of Ellie. But given that it’s an <strong>adaptation</strong>, many are claiming that it doesn’t <strong>need to be </strong>a like-for-like replication. In the first season of The Last of Us, some characters are dramatically different to their in-game representations, and everything panned out just fine.</p>



<p>It’ll be a while before we see Ramsay in action again as Ellie, as the second season isn’t expected to drop until 2025.</p>

<p>For many, Helldivers 2 provides a smooth gameplay experience. Sure, we’ve dealt with countless server-side issues, like the inability to connect or add friends, but the overall gameplay runs like butter most of the time. It’s primarily due to the game’s engine. Here is what you should know about the Helldivers 2 engine!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-helldivers-2-game-engine">What is the Helldivers 2 Game Engine?</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, the Helldivers 2 engine is extinct. Long before the third-person shooter took the world by storm, the engine in question, <strong>Autodesk Stingray</strong>, was the same one the team used to create the first Helldivers title on PlayStation consoles in 2015.</p>



<p>The kicker is that Autodesk Stingray was discontinued in 2018, long before Helldivers 2 launched worldwide, but after the game’s development period began. </p>



<p>Speaking about the engine, Pilestedt said: “Our crazy engineers had to do everything, with no support to build the game to parity with other engines. And yes. The project started before it was discontinued.”</p>







<h2 id="h-what-other-games-use-the-autodesk-stingray-engine">What Other Games Use the Autodesk Stingray Engine?</h2>



<p>At one point, the Swedish-crafted game engine Autodesk Stingray was immensely popular with developers. Alongside Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2, other notable titles on the Autodesk Stingray engine include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer: Vermintide 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</strong></li>



<li><strong>War of the Roses</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gauntlet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Magicka 2</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The most notable titles are the Warhammer games by developer Fatshark. Darktide is another title that launched well after the discontinuation of the 3D game engine.</p>

<p>With the immense hype surrounding Season 4 of Diablo 4, it’s no surprise that fans are flocking back to the ARPG in droves. The itemization reworks and new end-game content proves enticing, even for more casual players. But for those still relatively new, here’s how to prepare for Diablo 4 Season 4!</p>

<p>Suppose you’re among the many new players enjoying Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass; welcome! Before the start of Season 4, you should have made significant progress in finishing the primary campaign. It’s essential to complete the storyline, thereby unlocking the ability to skip the campaign the next time you create a character.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the campaign does an excellent job of introducing the world and gameplay mechanics. It’ll provide you with a foundation to tackle all the new content and mechanics in Season 4.</p>

<p>The world of Sanctuary is vast, and without a mount, you’ll spend countless time wandering the world on foot. It’s wasted time, unfortunately. You’ll unlock a mount in Diablo 4 by completing Donna’s Favor during Act 4 of the main campaign. It’s an easy enough questline that rewards you with the ability to ride horses and provides your first free horse.</p>



<p>Once you unlock a mount on a single character, they become available for all your current and future characters!</p>







<h2 id="h-collect-all-lilith-statues">Collect All Lilith Statues</h2>

<p>All around Sanctuary, you’ll uncover hidden Statues of Lilith that imbue your character with additional power. Each statue provides a unique buff to your stats, increasing your overall Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Willpower. Some, however, increase your Murmuring Obol Capacity or an additional Paragon Point. </p>



<p>No matter the reward, it’s worth your time and energy to track down all of the Statues of Lilith in Diablo 4. Once you unlock them, the buffs become available to all future characters. These buffs are account-wide! The downside is that there are approximately 160 scattered about the game world to find.</p>

<p>There are numerous resources online, including Reddit and gaming clan finder websites, where you can find a competent group of players to party up with in Diablo 4. You can solo some end-game content, but much of it requires an optimized group—for instance, the World Bosses, Nightmare Dungeons, and Duriel.</p>



<p>Plus, playing the game with a friend or two is much more enjoyable. Running solo is occasionally fun, and it’s the preferred way to play for many, but most of the time, it’s more entertaining with a pal!</p>

<p>We’re beyond excited about the itemization changes in Diablo 4 Season 4, but in the meantime, we have plenty of new coverage for you on Insider Gaming:</p>

<p>The drama continues. On Twitter, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov recently shared an image that seems to be more evidence of a case of plagiarism. In the last week or so, there have been rampant claims that Arena Breakout: Infinite has plagiarised Escape from Tarkov in several ways, but the most recent evidence suggests that bespoke assets created by Battlestate Games have been ‘lifted and shifted’ from Tarkov and planted in Arena Breakout: Infinite. </p>



<p>This claim follows posts by Buyanov suggesting that ‘unknown information’ was found in Arena Breakout: Infinite’s code referencing Escape from Tarkov bosses – information that never made it to light as Tarkov was developed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-knife-edge-debate">Knife Edge Debate</h2>



<p>There is no doubt that Arena Breakout: Infinite smacks of Escape from Tarkov in some ways. In many other ways, it’s a better title that seems to be more stable and much more entertaining, which many are claiming is why Battlestate Games has gone on the offensive against the Tencent-backed extraction shooter.</p>



<p>In the last few weeks, Battlestate Games has been writhing under the weight of controversies surrounding The Unheard Edition, a brand-new edition of Escape from Tarkov with a high price tag that caused a scandalous response from the community when it was revealed. </p>



<p>Recently, Buyanov posted a cryptic message on Twitter that showed two renders of an AK dust cover, a weapon part that’s almost instantly recognisable among fans of the first-person shooter genre of games. These two renders, complete with polygonal maps, were shown side by side with the caption, ‘It’s a Match!’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the comments, someone asked if the asset was ‘BSG designed’, to which Buyanov wrote, ‘it’s ours, we do every single weapon in EFT and we have all of the necessary source files for that.’ That’s a direct indicator that, if the post is accurate, it’s evidence of plagiarism between these two games.</p>



<p>Of course, the community hasn’t been sympathetic to Buyanov’s plight, given the recent sentiment around Escape from Tarkov.</p>

            <p>
A number of "experimental" changes have been made to Manor Lords to tweak the balance, including reduced ale consumption.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the weekend, the game's solo developer Greg Styczeń released a Steam blog post detailing a tonne of changes, which are available now for open testing.
</p>
<p>
The update fixes a number of commonly reported issues, including "None" people spawning and not working; the game being stuck at the summary screen after a victory; weak archer damage; and overly high ale consumption.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Further, a King's Tax has been introduced and is collected annually from players to prevent them hoarding cash, plus amendments have been made to trading posts with a 'local only' option.
</p>
<p>
The trading change in particular appears to be in response to Styczeń requesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-wants-your-help-should-its-op-trade-system-be-changed">feedback on the "OP" trade system</a>.

</p>
<p>
On top of the extensive experimental updates, there are plenty of minor tweaks to improve the game experience, as well as bug and crash fixes to ensure better stability.
</p>
<p>
The full update notes can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/4201372769976733265?l=english">read on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Manor Lords, the medieval city builder and strategy hybrid, got off to a great start on its early access release at the end of April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-sells-1m-copies-in-24-hours-reveals-whats-coming-next">selling 1m copies in its first 24 hours</a>. It went on to set an all-time concurrent player peak of 173,178, though player counts have since dipped (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1363080/charts/">SteamDB</a>).


</p>
<p>
Still, updates such as this one will ensure the game is continually supported as depth is added and bugs are fixed - the biggest criticisms of the game at launch.
</p>
<p>
"There's a confidence to Manor Lords that belies its one-person development, and what's there can be spellbinding, but it's a pastoral idyll that still needs significant development," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Eurogamer Manor Lords early access review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-new-multiversus-joker-trailer-has-basically-confirmed-the-powerpuff-girls-are-on-their-way/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-new-multiversus-joker-trailer-has-basically-confirmed-the-powerpuff-girls-are-on-their-way" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The new MultiVersus Joker trailer has basically confirmed The Powerpuff Girls are on their way</a> - Michael Beckwith</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="341" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mark-hamill-set-to-voice-the-joker-in-his-multiversus-roster-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week’s <em>MultiVersus</em> character reveal</a>, Player First Games has put out a proper gameplay trailer for the crossover’s newest playable fighter: The Joker. Despite the Clown Prince of Crime being the focus, though, Player First seems to have taken the opportunity to tease another set of characters, The Powerpuff Girls.</p> <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">The trailer begins with Batman’s computer being hacked by the Joker, which brings up profiles of several other playable characters. Eagle-eyed fans quickly noticed all three Powerpuff Girls—Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup—appearing on the display in the top right corner. Although unlike the rest of the characters, they’re depicted with what looks like art from their show rather than in-game renders. Still, the fact they’re there at all may as well be official confirmation of their inclusion.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="MultiVersus – Official The Joker “Send in the Clowns!” Gameplay Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Nshwsz-f7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="670" data-current-count="970" data-injectable="true">The Powerpuff Girls were always a safe bet for <em>MultiVersus</em>. Aside from being popular Cartoon Network characters, evidence of their inclusion was uncovered via datamines from 2023, courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/AusilMV/status/1643284200403922945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user AusilMV</a>, and their home city of Townsville seemed to be in the background of <a href="https://twitter.com/nosyboyyt/status/1781011124449681447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a clip teasing a new Superman costume</a>. The real question is whether they’ll be three separate characters with their own movesets, or if they’ll share a roster slot and all play identically to each other. Also, there’s no telling when they’ll be added to <em>MultiVersus</em>, though I imagine we won’t hear details until after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-returns-with-new-characters-pve-mode-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s full release on May 28</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="616" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">The Powerpuff Girls may not be the only Cartoon Network icons being teased for <em>MultiVersus</em> either. In the same trailer, around the 49 second mark, we can see a brand-new stage set in a laboratory. Some fans in the comments section believe this is meant to be Dexter’s laboratory from… <em>Dexter’s Laboratory</em>, which could mean the boy genius will join the roster too. In the bottom right hand corner, you can even see a sign that looks an awful lot like the “No Dee Dee” sign Dexter has on his bedroom door in the show, meant to bar his annoying older sister from entering (it never works).</p>
 <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="false"><em>MultiVersus</em>‘ roster was always one of its strong points and there’s plenty of exciting potential for future inclusions thanks to Warner Bros’ extensive catalogue of IP to draw from. However, the game has a lot to prove to try and win over players. Many were annoyed when it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-beta-offline-june-closing-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went offline last year</a>, especially since some had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/youre-on-the-hook-for-multiversus-refunds-um-what/">already spent money on its microtransactions</a>, with no option to claim refunds. Any purchases are expected to carry over into the full game, but the whole thing still left a sour taste in fans’ mouths. As such, <em>MultiVersus</em> faces an uphill battle to curry back players’ favour, and adding new characters is only a part of that.</p>

<p>Some of what's being introduced in today's update was already teased as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-roadmap">roadmap back in February</a>, although naturally, details were fairly scarce until now.</p>
<p>First up in the "Hoxxes Fights Back" update is a new boss, the Dreadnought Twins. One will engage you in melee, while the other will hang back and fire deadly projectiles at you. They'll also heal one another if one takes a lot more damage than the other.</p>

The Dreadnought can now stomp to summon spikes that trap you unless you dig through them, and it can summon a swarm of Glyphids to swamp you as well.</p>
<p>Two major new enemies, the Q'ronar Shellback Elite and the Huuli Hoarder, have been introduced in this&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update, with the Hoarder dropping a veritable treasure trove of loot if you manage to take it down.</p>
<p>You'll also find a new Weapon Inspect screen that lets you examine a weapon in detail by pausing your run. Stats shown include damage, reload time, and special bonuses, among other things.</p>
<p>All of this is in addition to new weapon stats, lots of new Overclocks, and, of course, plenty of balance and gameplay improvements to make your&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>experience a touch smoother.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff of the popular multiplayer shooter&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>. Unlike its parent, this one's a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>-style auto-shooter, albeit one with a distinctly&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>flavor.</p>
<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently in Early Access.

			<p>A The Legend of Zelda: BOTW Switch 2 version might very well be in the works at Nintendo.</p>
<p>Remember when we covered that Nintendo allegedly showed off an improved version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-shown-improved-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breath of the Wild on the Switch 2 during Gamescom last year</a>? As covered back then, the Switch successor was demoed behind closed doors, and one of the games that was shown was reportedly an enhanced version of 2017's Zelda entry. Shortly after this initial report, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-4k-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote that the Switch 2 was claimed to be capable of running Breath of the Wild in 4K resolution at 60FPS</a>. Although we assumed that this was merely a tech demo to display the capabilities of the Switch successor, known SEGA/Atlus leaker 'Midori' now suggests that Nintendo is actually working on an enhanced BOTW Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>"There is a project at Nintendo with the codename U-King-O It might be related to the rumors of the next Nintendo console codename", the leaker wrote on X yesterday. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-codename-successor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered yesterda</a>y, the codename for the Switch 2 codename is said to be 'Muji'.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Skipp93653/status/1789531857429704947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> on X by user 'Skipper93653' "U-King" was the codename for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and the addition of the "O" suffix hasn't been used by Nintendo before. This might very well suggest that the "O" suffix is for the Switch successor.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is an enhanced version of Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild's codename is U-King. For Switch 1 ports, Nintendo likes to add on the suffix -S to a game's codename, but this one has a -O suffix which they have never used before. I think this is for the successor.</p>
<p>— Skipper93653 (@Skipp93653) <a href="https://twitter.com/Skipp93653/status/1789531857429704947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yep, the Captain Toad port is the perfect example of this. It was 'Kinopio' on Wii U, 'Kinopio-S' on Switch, and 'Kinopio-C' on 3DS.</p>
<p>— Skipper93653 (@Skipp93653) <a href="https://twitter.com/Skipp93653/status/1789542565676528066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although not confirmed in any way, we can see Nintendo releasing a BOTW version for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next console</a> - after all, almost all Wii U games (except for much-demanded Twilight Princess and Wind Waker) have since been ported to the original Switch. In all honesty, we would love to see Nintendo release a BOTW Switch 2 version that runs at 60FPS in 4K resolution. On the current Switch, the game runs in 900p at 30FPS in docked mode, and 720p at 30FPS in handheld mode.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Will Nintendo bring BOTW to its next console? Would you buy it? Hit the comments below.</p>
