			<p>Red Barrels has recently confirmed that they were the victim of a cybersecurity incident. Red Barrels are known for making the notorious Outlast games, with their most recent game being the multiplayer title, The Outlast Trials. Red Barrels has confirmed that no player data has been compromised in the cybersecurity incident, but there will be significant delays in production, as the incident targeted the development team. It appears that<a href="https://x.com/AlvieriD/status/1841558903836049813" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nitrogen Ransomware</a> committed the attack.</p>
<p>"The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event involving access to some of its data." While they weren't working on developing a new game publicly, they have stated that the development has affected their content plans for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-announces-brand-new-killer-and-map/">The Outlast Trials</a>.</p>
<p>"As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information confirmed therein. A group of leading external cybersecurity experts have been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident. We also notified stakeholders potentially affected by the event and relevant authorities." The statement made by the Red Barrels team also makes sure to note that the employees have been offered "appropriate support."</p>
<p>Authorities and cybersecurity have already investigated the incident, and the statement reassures players that they have not been impacted in any way by the event. However, the team has noted that some of the content they were planning on releasing soon will have to be delayed, as it was significantly impacted by the event. While they can't share too many details at the moment as they continue to learn more information about the cybersecurity incident, they have commented saying that they will share more details in the near future.</p>
<p>"Faced with a constantly evolving cyber threat, the studio will continue to implement appropriate measures guided by the best practices to ensure a secure environment for our employees, partners and players." Red Barrels have stated that they are continuing to focus on The Outlast Trials, and the future of the multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Since this event is still fresh, they aren't able to provide more information about what exactly happened as thorough investigations need to be done, but they will give more information in the new future about what exactly has been impacted, and what delays players can expect in the future.</p>

On Wednesday, Krafton — the publisher behind <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> — <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-%ED%8C%B0%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8A%A4/">announced that it acquired</a> the license for <em>Palworld</em> and will optimize it for mobile gaming, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/459122/palworld-mobile-pubg-studios">as reported earlier by <em>Polygon</em></a>.</p><p>According to a translated version of the post, Krafton says it aims to “faithfully reinterpret” <em>Palworld</em>’s “main fun elements to fit the mobile environment.” Krafton also created a mobile version of <em>PUBG</em> in 2018, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17128526/pubg-mobile-hands-on-review-vs-xbox-fortnite">as <em>The Verge</em> pointed out at the time</a>, it turned out better than expected.</p><p>Dubbed “<em>Pokémon</em> with guns,” <em>Palworld</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">became an instant hit</a> following its release on PC and Xbox in January, selling millions of copies as players explored and caught creatures throughout the sprawling Palpagos Islands. But last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company sued Pocketpair</a> over accusations it violated multiple patent rights.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248957/pocketpair-pokemon-patent-infrigement-lawsuit">Pocketpair replied</a>, saying it’s “unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon.” <em>Palworld</em> has since arrived on the PlayStation 5, but its release is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253687/palworld-ps5-japan-release-date-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit">delayed indefinitely in Japan</a>. Aside from <em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo also appears to have set its sights on Switch emulators, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx becoming the latest one to shut down</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables"><h2>We tested six smart rings, and there’s a clear winner</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24258431/sonos-app-controversy-patrick-spence-plan"><h2>Sonos has a plan to earn back your trust, and here it is</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259598/fasetto-dolby-atmos-audio-cu-speakers-power-lines"><h2>These boxes will send Dolby Atmos through your home’s power lines</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259408/bose-bluetooth-wireless-speaker-soundlink-home"><h2>Bose’s new SoundLink Home is one of its best-looking wireless speakers</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github"><h2>Nintendo has reportedly shut down Ryujinx, the Switch emulator that was supposedly immune</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You hunt monsters. To be more specific, <em>Monster Hunter </em>games let you and friends join up to hunt down large creatures in a sprawling fantasy open world. You collect gear and resources as you take down progressively tougher enemies solo or in co-op. Each entry shares this basic structure, with slight iterations on the formula. </p><p>While <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> isn’t the most recent release—that would be 2021’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126"><em>Rise</em></a></span>—it is still the best entry point for those wanting to dip their toes in. One of the hurdles new <em>Monster Hunter </em>players encounter has always been how slow the games are to start. It’s not an uncommon sentiment that the real fun of <em>Monster Hunter</em> begins in the post-game, which…isn’t a very convincing argument for those not already invested. <em>World </em>removes the slow start and immediately gives you and your friends reasons to want to learn more. </p><p>Some people might be particularly inclined to enjoy <em>Monster Hunter</em> this year thanks to the success of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, another Capcom action-RPG all about long battles against impressive enemies. If you enjoyed the epic battles of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, you’ll probably enjoy <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. In <em>World</em>, even while you haven’t yet mastered combat, you’ll still have a great time swinging a massive club at a giant lizard to beat the crap out of them. At the end of the day, that’s what<em> Monster Hunter</em> is all about, and <em>World </em>is the best way to help you experience that. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has announced he'll be wrapping up his acclaimed YouTube series Creating Games on 15th October, bringing his regular video uploads to an end.
</p>
<p>
Sakurai <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">launched his YouTube channel</a> back in August 2022, with the aim of helping "make games around the world a little more fun". His Creating Games series, available in both Japanese and English, saw Sakurai sharing his decades of expertise on "good" or "fun" game design, and was intended to be as accessible as possible.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Sakurai has uploaded an impressive 265 videos for his Creating Games series, covering everything from UI design and tips for using audio to marketing and work ethic. It is, in other words, an incredible resource from a world-renowned designer, and it's popped out more than a few gems of wisdom and fascinating tidbits along the way.

<p>
Back in 2023, for instance, Sakurai shared the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-kid-icarus-game-seems-unlikely-masahiro-sakurai-says">frankly upsetting</a> news a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kid-icarus-uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a> was "unlikely", and he more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-director-so-sorry-to-fans-playing-for-thousands-of-hours">jokingly apologised</a> to Smash Bros. players for the "hundreds or even thousands of hours" they'd poured into the series thanks to his design.

But all good things must come to an end, and  - following advanced warning of Creating Games' impending demise earlier this year - Sakurai has now <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1841424960151228598">confirmed</a> the series is expected to end on 15th October. Of course, all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en/videos">existing videos</a> will remain available, and Sakurai has teased "a special finale episode to come afterward", with more details to be shared in the future.
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for Sakurai after his YouTube series ends, he hasn't explicitly said. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-ultimate-sequel-will-take-time-sakurai-says">comments made by the designer last year</a> suggest he's returning to Smash Bros. "What happens next time?" he pondered in one of his videos at the time. "I mean whatever comes after Smash Bros. Ultimate. One option would be to separate the series from the original creator. But for now, at least, I can't really imagine a Smash Bros. title without me."
</p>
<p>
"Smash Bros. is a massive, important title for Nintendo, so it's fair to assume there will be another one at some point, but it's going to take some work to figure out exactly how to make that happen. For my part, I'd like to keep working with Nintendo however I'm able."

Unsurprisingly, <em>Ragnarök </em>was always going to be a top candidate for the company’s push on PC, where it’s been porting exclusive titles since <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn </em>back in 2020. Well, now <em>Ragnarök </em>has landed on Steam, and the people have thoughts.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196191" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Ragnarök DLC: Spend 19 Minutes In Valhalla" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="1149" data-playlist="196191,192804,196196" data-current="196191"><div><p>God Of War Ragnarök DLC: Spend 19 Minutes In Valhalla</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21730.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Most of those thoughts are pretty similar to the praise that <em>Ragnarok </em>first earned at its initial launch. Folks on Steam are absolutely loving it, and one person even called it one of the best games they’ve ever played. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fgod-of-war-ragnarok%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fgod-of-war-ragnarok%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ragnarök</em>’s PC port</a></span> is receiving near universal praise in most regards, from its fidelity to its story. It seems many are happy just to have received the follow-up to the previous <em>God of War </em>game after more than two years of waiting.<br></p><p>However, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888">PC version isn’t without some problems</a></span>, as is commonly the case with these PlayStation ports. Though <em>Ragnarök </em>appears to be one of the more stable of the bunch, there have been mixed arguments about the game’s performance. Some claim to be playing the game with very little issue on systems that are several years old, while others who sound like they have suped up PCs have complained that the port still demands even more of them. Your mileage may vary, but it should kind of go without saying that if you’re expecting to run one of these blockbuster high-fidelity games, you should have quite the powerhouse PC. Even then, it might not be the most optimized experience.</p><p>There’s also a contingent of people in the Steam reviews making a big stink over something else, and it’s probably the dominating critique of the whole forum: PSN logins. After the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071"><em>Helldivers 2 </em>login drama</a></span> nearly ruined that game’s reputation, PlayStation walked back the requirement for PC players to <em>need </em>a PSN account to login for that game alone. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-steam-reviews-1851605129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-steam-reviews-1851605129"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s PC port</a></span> required the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-playstation-network-steam-psn-1851457950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-playstation-network-steam-psn-1851457950">same login for its online mode</a></span>, and now <em>Ragnarök </em>has a similar demand, which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-war-ragnarok-steam-reviews-psn-login-requirement-1851654047#:~:text=God%20Of%20War%20Ragnar%C3%B6k%20is%20currently%20sitting%20at%20a%2065,serious%20bugs%20or%20gameplay%20shortcomings.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-ragnarok-steam-reviews-psn-login-requirement-1851654047#:~:text=God%20Of%20War%20Ragnar%C3%B6k%20is%20currently%20sitting%20at%20a%2065,serious%20bugs%20or%20gameplay%20shortcomings.">incensed</a></span> fans who don’t want to have to make another account to play a game they own or have to trust Sony with their private information. </p><p>A modder already implemented a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-account-steam-link-remove-mod-1851655976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-account-steam-link-remove-mod-1851655976">way around the login requirement</a></span>, though the mod has been taken down by its creator for undisclosed reasons. Meanwhile, the war over PSN logins continues to rage in <em>Ragnarök</em>’s Steam reviews, including a few comments suggesting that you can in fact bypass the requirement without mods. If you’re picking up the port, it’s at least something to be aware of, so that you can sort out your feelings prior to jumping in and getting hit with a sign-in menu.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/incursion-red-river-massive-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/incursion-red-river%E2%80%99s-1-1-0-0-update-is-absolutely-massive.998928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/incursion-red-river-massive-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Incursion Red River has just received a monumental update that has blown the alpha product wide open. It’s the 1.1.0.0 update, and it brings countless tweaks and additions to the single-player and co-op exclusive extraction shooter that has been turning heads since April 2024.</p>



<p>I got hands-on with Incursion Red River during February’s Steam Next Fest and was blown away by the visuals and potential of the project. If anything, 1.1.0.0 is set to blow my mind further with everything that’s being added.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-changes">Big Changes</h2>



<p>Incursion Red River hasn’t received as much attention as typical extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov because it’s not PvP-focused – but that shouldn’t be enough to put you off. It’s a brilliant game that has been impressing users worldwide for months, despite being an alpha product at present.</p>



<p>In the first development blog for the game, the team at Games of Tomorrow walked through the massive 1.1.0.0 update, which is large enough that you’d think it’d be pushing it into beta at the very least.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update sits an all-new map – Bunker. This close-quarters, dank map will have players jumping at shadows as they navigate an underground facility on the hunt for the game’s best loot. Elsewhere on the map from, the team has overhauled Quarry to ‘better capture the mood of being in a tropical environment’. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Incursion Red River Alpha Update 1.1.0.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1BZoMYc3DkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the 1.1.0.0 update, a slew of new weapons and attachments have been added, and the AI that drives the game’s enemies has been adjusted in many ways. New voice lines have also increased the immersion elements of the game, and Games of Tomorrow has injected a new medical system into the title. </p>



<p>But that’s not all:</p>



<ul>
<li>New animations</li>



<li>‘Key’ system</li>



<li>Penetration system and enhanced ballistics</li>



<li>New bosses</li>



<li>New tasks</li>



<li>Barter expansion</li>



<li>Inventory enhancements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s looking good for Incursion Red River, per the team’s update in the Steam blog post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the year of 2024 approaching its end, our focus remains on finishing the items on our original roadmap. However, we will also return to you soon with a brand new roadmap for 2025. To be completely transparent, we plan to keep the 6 month release cycle as originally announced, as it suits our team size &amp; scope best and ensures each update comes with meaningful content &amp; improvements. We will keep you updated every month with our development update as well, so catch you all later!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Have you given Incursion Red River a try yet, or are you not a fan of the single-player mechanics in extraction shooters? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Red Barrels, developer of the Outlast games, has announced that it was recently the victim of a cybersecurity incident. The developer has confirmed that no player data has been compromised, but the hit has been significant on the development team, and it will impact production, which will lead to delays of content. The full statement from Red Barrels can be read below.</p>
<p><em>“The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event, involving access to some of its data. As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information confirmed therein. A group of leading external cybersecurity experts have been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident. We also notified stakeholders potentially affected by the event and relevant authorities. As a precautionary measure our employees have been offered appropriate support. With the investigation now completed and the security event contained, we want to reassure you that our players have not been impacted by the event.</em></p>


<p><em>The hit on our production timeline has been significant. We will do our best to follow our roadmap but unfortunately, some things will have to be delayed. We’ll share a more detailed update on that as soon as we can. We take this event and the security of information within our care very seriously. Faced with a constantly evolving cyber threat, the studio will continue to implement appropriate measures guided by the best practices to ensure a secure environment for our employees, partners, and players. We appreciate the support of our incredible community as we focus on the future of The Outlast Trials.”</em></p>
<p>As stated, Red Barrels will give more information about what exactly has been impacted in terms of its development plans, and what kind of delays to expect with future content for The Outlast Trials. When that information is made available, we will bring it to you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Swen Vincke accepted an award in Malaysia today and made a comment about their plans for upcoming games and what fans of the studio can expect. On stage at the SEA Game Awards 2024, Larian Studios received a Special Recognition Award, where Vincke said, "We need to work hard on the next game so we can be back here in five years." Immediately after their acceptance speech on stage, they spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN in a quick interview</a>. This means that the next game to be released by them would be released in 2029. However, they did state to IGN that the statement was a joke. "They're big games and it takes time, so don't hold us to a date."</p>
<p>To help produce Baldur's Gate 3, Larian Studios opened multiple development studios around the world to keep up with its "following the sun" concept of 24-hour game development. Teams can seamlessly hand off their work to the next time zone, speeding up development without the need for crunching to meet goals. Larian Studios had development studios in Kuala Lumpur, Barcelona, Dublin, Guildford, Quebec, Warsaw, and Ghent.</p>
<p>While they continue to make updates for Baldur's Gate 3, Larian is continuing to make new content and has announced that they are working on more than one game. At least one of them is seemingly shaping up to be a brand new title rather than an entry to the revered Divinity series or Baldur's Gate. It's already been previously confirmed that they aren't making another Baldur's Gate game in an interview with Vincke. That isn't to say there wasn't any development made for Baldur's Gate 4, and the content that was made was said to be enjoyable. However, Vincke said that creating a game like BG3 made them "vulnerable" and wanted to step away from the franchise, leading <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast/">Wizards of the Coast</a> to consider another developer for the title.</p>
<p>Admittedly, producing any game after Baldur's Gate 3 is going to be a mammoth task for the team, as there will always be the question of whether it will perform as well. "Expectations are incredibly high, so I told the team, 'Just follow your gut, and we'll see where we end up," says Vincke. "It's OK to fail - failure has always been in the DNA of the studio; failing is part of creativity, and we have to remember that. I'm happy that we're out of the circus now, and we can focus on what we're doing."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/offbrand-games-on-what-it-means-to-be-publisher-in-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/offbrand-games-on-what-it-means-to-be-a-publisher-in-2024.998901/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/offbrand-games-on-what-it-means-to-be-publisher-in-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you think of "game publisher," what comes to mind? The truth is, the definition of game publisher is hard to pin down, and that's because they are ever-changing. Not every publisher provides the same benefits and perks, but one thing is certain: Publishers' names are attached to the games they put out to the world.</p>
<p>Challenging this idea is a relatively new phenomena of influencer-created publishing companies. Big Mode, headed by popular YouTuber videogamedunkey, put out Billy Basso's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface"><em>Animal Well</em></a> earlier this year. Another such publisher, <a href="https://offbrand.gg/">Offbrand Games</a>, is hoping to make waves with its upcoming platform fighter title, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217000/Rivals_of_Aether_II/"><em>Rivals of Aether 2</em></a>.</p>
<p>Created by Ludwig Ahgren and Thor (aka PirateSoftware), TechRaptor wanted to learn how these publishers stand apart from others. To that end, we talked with Offbrand Games Director of Publishing Bryan Herren to learn more about the benefits of being led by influencers, and how to -- hopefully -- become successful in a highly volatile industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/offbrand-games-announcement.jpg?itok=SOH8Rmrf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/offbrand-games-announcement.jpg?itok=G8UXUgwo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ludwig and PirateSoftware announced the publisher earlier this year during IGN Live. (Image courtesy of IGN via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppAAyQ395xc">YouTube</a>.)</figcaption></figure><h2>Getting a Foot in the Door</h2>
<p>Offbrand Games is one part of the Offbrand umbrella, a brand co-founded by Ludwig several years ago. This new branch aims to act as a publisher for games, but the overarching brand itself is known for producing high quality, streamer-related events such as the <a href="https://tiltify.com/@cdawg-va/cdawgva-charity-auction-2024">CDawgVA Charity Auction</a> and the Olympics-inspired <a href="https://streamergames.gg/">Streamer Games</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One wouldn't immediately see how being a production studio would correlate to video game publishing, but the pieces for a publisher were already there. Offbrand has an in-house marketing team, in-house artists for graphics, and other valuable resources a publisher might need.</p>
<p>"And so for a lot of other publishers, that is getting outsourced to agencies to do," said Herren. "And so the fact that we can do it in house is really powerful. And then we have the ability to use our events that we're running to promote our games, right? And so I think what you're seeing, not only in the influencer publishing space, but in other areas of celebrity, is people using their platforms to create products that they're passionate about, and then using their platforms to like, market their existence."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ludwig-streamer-games.jpg?itok=PuEKES-Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ludwig-streamer-games.jpg?itok=JTNilpRq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ludwig's Streamer Games was produced by Offbrand. (Image courtesy of Offbrand Studio <a href="https://x.com/offbrand_studio/status/1825030843536117991/photo/2">via Twitter</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Herren also notes that not all publishers fall into the same basket, as some will provide, say, technical assistance with in-house QA, while others provide funding. As a new publisher, he admits it's asking a lot for developers to believe in what Offbrand Games could provide out the gate.</p>
<p>"So we had to build trust, right?" said Herren. "You know, we are coming from a space of we haven't published games before, so people are going to have to take a leap of faith to work with us, and that we are going to be able to hold up our end of the bargain despite not technically having done it before."</p>
<p>With plenty of experience in publishing numerous indie games in the past, Herren was able to assuage any concerns, though he admits it was difficult operating under the radar, trying to get developers on board before the publisher's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppAAyQ395xc">formal announcement</a> last June during IGN Live.</p>

<h2><em>Rivals of Aether II</em>'s on the Horizon</h2>
<p>During that IGN Live event, the publisher announced their first game, which launches in a few weeks on October 23: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217000/Rivals_of_Aether_II/"><em>Rivals of Aether II</em></a>, the anticipated sequel a popular indie platform fighter. Its successful Kickstarter received over $1 million in funding, and has an army of fans chomping at the bit to play.</p>
<p><em>"</em>So a lot of the things I was talking about before in terms of marketing, and I would say that like our relationship with Aether Studios and <em>Rivals </em>is much more loaded on that new publisher angle of we're creating trailers, we're running events, we're doing marketing, we're doing influencer reach outs," said Herren.</p>
<p>The role Offbrand Games plays is as co-publisher with the game's developer, Aether Studios. On the surface, then, the choice to publish this sequel seems random, but it was intentional on Offbrand Games' part. It's no secret <em>Rivals of Aether II</em> is heavily inspired by <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, which is something near and dear to many of the publisher's employees.</p>

<p>Herren is also the founder of Smash Summit, a popular series of now-defunct <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate"><em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</a> tournaments. <em>Rivals of Aether </em>head Dan Fornace sponsored one of the first Summit tournaments, so there was already a relationship established. Other employees within Offbrand are said to be big fans as well; Ludwig, for instance, is a <em>Smash</em> player and runs events and even commentates.</p>
<p>"It just was a very natural fit for our first partnership that just made sense," said Herren.</p>

<h2>A Co-Op in Game Publishing</h2>
<p>Offbrand Games may very well be one of co-op game publishers in the business, and no, we're not talking about cooperative games. To <a href="https://x.com/offbrand_studio/status/1799250052919210311">quote directly</a> from Offbrand, being a co-op means "each full-time Offbrand employee will have a vote on the direction of the company, and our profit will be shared evenly amongst co-op members." This puts the publishing division in a unique position.</p>
<p>"We're not precluded from getting venture capital," said Herren. "But there's no reason for a venture capitalist to ever invest in our company, because legally in the United States, the amount of return they can get is capped every year. Any investor into Offbrand would be limited by a pretty significant amount in terms of, like, how much they would get year over year."</p>
<p>What does this mean for the products they produce? As we've seen far too many times this year, developers and publishers alike are either laying off employees en masse or shutting down completely; by being a co-op, it's the hope that there is a system of checks and balances, and that all employees have a say in the decisions being made.</p>
<p>"As a result, our focus is not on, you know, 5xing the size of the company in five years, it's being sustainable," said Herren. "And so, we're going at this in a slow and measured way. That means that we're, hopefully, still going to be around in 10 years, and we will be -- if we're successful -- slightly bigger. We won't suddenly be like this multinational corporation, right?"</p>

<p>Developers have responded to this approach favorably, according to Herren. Offbrand Games touted itself as a developers- and player-first company. Herren wants developers themselves to feel good about the way games are promoted. This stems from a mindset that the streamers Offbrand Studios supported in previous endeavors should feel listened to and to have ideas valued -- he says the developers are in charge.</p>
<p>"And so we took that kind of idea of like creators first," said Herren, "and then applied that to game development by saying, developers are creators too, right? They're creating their own products, just like a Twitch streamer is creating their stream or creating their content.</p>
<p>"These are developers that are going through really intense creative processes, and it's their baby, right? This is what they're working on. This is what they're spending, you know, sometimes decades of their life on and so. We want to make sure that with every decision that we make... is an extremely transparent process with our developers to make sure that they feel like this is representing them and who they are."</p>

<p>It's not a hyperbole to say influencers can be controversial. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor">a certain influencer was dropped by their own game studio</a>. There's an inherent risk attaching a public figure's name to a brand, and this is something Offbrand Games acknowledges.</p>
<p>"I don't want to pretend that we're like some Messiah coming in to save the industry," said Herren. "We're not. We're not trying to be that, we're not big enough to do that. Our only hope is that we can do right by our developers and do right by our customers. And we are open to being told that we're not doing right by either group, and we want to listen and learn and hope to do the best we can."</p>
<p>That said, the two key figures in the limelight for Offbrand Games each come with a key set of skills that will, hopefully, set its developers up for success. These are the aforementioned Ludwig Ahgren and PirateSoftware. As influencers with large followings, they're not immune to community backlash, which means more is at stake should they make a misstep.</p>
<p>Both have years of experience in content creation, but Thor from PirateSoftware, in particular, has tangible experience in the game industry, like working at Blizzard. With Thor's know-how (on top of his large following on Twitch and YouTube), it's Herren's hope this can help the publisher navigate the murky waters of game publishing. Ludwig, on the other hand, is like the life of the party.</p>

<p>"[Ludwig's] kind of that guy where he, like, put all of his points into charisma when he was born," said Herren, "and so he's really good at, like, bringing people together, running events, hosting events, utilizing those events to promote our games, and talking about games honestly, and his community believing him when he says something."</p>
<p>Herren's perspective on game publishing is candid -- game developers don't <em>need</em> a publisher. Steam allows for games to be self-published, and those can go on to become successful. Even still, companies like Offbrand Games hope to provide valuable resources to developers that would otherwise be unavailable.</p>
<p>"We want everyone to be going wide-eyed into our partnership, knowing what we're providing," said Herren, "what you're getting out of it, and not thinking of it as like, 'oh, I have to have this to be successful,' right? And so as a result of that, what the value a publisher provides is changing.</p>
<p>"And so I think creators and influencers are realizing that they have a lot to offer developers in terms of feedback, community, marketing, exposure that makes you know them working on game publishing a great fit, and I'm just happy that streamers and influencers have started investing in games instead of investing in cryptocurrency.<em>"</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/city-20-offers-unparalleled-freedom-in-an-apocalyptic-world.998895/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/city-20-freedom-apocalypse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>City 20 could be your next favourite survival sandbox title. I was lucky enough to play City 20 ahead of it launching into early access, and from the moment I was thrown into the dystopian, unforgiving world, I knew I was in for something special. Within minutes, I learned that I was truly left to my own devices, free to carve whatever path I wanted – or to succumb to the harsh environment around me.</p>



<p>If you’ve been waiting for a unique and genuinely intriguing apocalypse-like survival game, it’s here and waiting for you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-your-typical-end-of-the-world-scenario">Not Your Typical End of the World Scenario</h2>



<p>City 20 might look a little strange on the surface, but the depth it offers is almost unparalleled. Per the game’s description, you’re free to ‘craft your own narrative’, and as I abandoned my starter objectives and ventured out into a wasteland in search of fame and fortune, I quickly found that claim to be true.</p>



<p>One minute, I was focused on fixing a broken door, and in the next, I was on a hunt for exclusive loot for survivors in a nearby town, desperate to impress them and build a stronger relationship so that I could access better trading options and improve my standing with the settlement.</p>



<p>Not too long after that, I was moving into an apartment in a decrepit block a few streets away, kitting it out with furniture while remaining wary of my neighbours, who I wasn’t sure about. Night fell, and I took to the streets with a torch, coming face-to-face with the predatory creatures that stalked the less populated areas of City 20 in the darkness.</p>



<p>It’s not inaccurate to suggest that City 20 has unlimited potential. Players are free to go where they please, build what they want, make friends with who they desire, and kill anyone they cross paths with. It’s not a <strong>true </strong>apocalypse, but it’s not far off the mark, with players being left to survive in a city walled off from the rest of the world 20 years after a radioactive incident.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-options">Unlimited Options</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>City 20 is <strong>intelligent</strong>. In this game, you’re a catalyst, and you decide how the world unravels around you. For instance, if you hunt too many docile animals, you’ll cause predators to become bolder. If you cause too much trouble in a settlement, you’ll make guards more aggressive.</p>



<p>Every NPC is named and has a purpose. You can form relationships with all of them, trading with them and learning about them through conversations — or if you want, you can run up to them and sock them in the face, wreaking havoc on everyone you see. </p>



<p>What’s brilliant about City 20 is that it’s not overwhelming, despite the choices available. If you’d rather take things slow, explore all the corners of the map, and gently make friends with other survivors, you’re more than welcome to do so. If you’d like, you can retire early, set up a homestead, take to farming, and trade with locals to foster those relationships.</p>



<p>Ultimately, City 20 will have you constantly wondering what you <strong>can </strong>do next, not what you <strong>should </strong>do next. Do you want to round up resources and become materialistic and rich, or do you want to become a servant of the people, running endless quests and poking through the wasteland to find rare, long-forgotten items?</p>



<p>It’s up to you – and what’s more, the game is in early access now, so there’s plenty lined up in terms of delivery.</p>



<p><em>City 20 is available now, exclusively on PC.</em></p>

            <p>
Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will apparently be delving deep into the series' mythology, with one of its returning cast members recently teasing an "intriguing" setting, plus characters including "old favourites" and "really deep cuts" - and if that doesn't include Birdo, I will riot.
</p>
<p>
Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 - the sequel to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">hugely successful</a> (and shamefully Birdo-free) animated cinematic hit - is still some way from its planned 2026 release, but that hasn't stopped Toad voice actor Keegan-Michael Key from teasing some of what's to come.
</p>
<p>
"One thing I can say about the second movie is that it's a little broader in scope, and where it takes place is very intriguing lore and the Mario world," Key <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/streaming/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2">told Men's Journal</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/super-mario-bros-movie-2-actor-teases-intriguing-setting-and-deep-cut-characters/">VGC</a>). "They're going to find some really fantastic Easter eggs and it's been very exciting so far."
</p>

<figcaption>Here's what last year's Mario movie looked like, in case you forgot.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNcTBXTk4I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"[Creatively] they've really widened out the universe that these characters live in," Key continued, "and we're going to meet some new folks. We're going to meet some new folks that are old favourites and some folks that I think are really deep cuts, but because of the way the story's laying itself out right now, those characters are going to be very intriguing."
</p><p>
The original Super Mario Bros. Movie was, of course, already postively festooned with Easter Eggs (making the Birdo omission even more unforgivable), so it's not exactly a revelation to hear that'll continue in the sequel. But the news does at least open the door for some genteel speculation while we await more solid news.
</p>
<p>
Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi, Princess Daisy, Rosalina, and Bowser Jr. were, for instance, all notably absent from the first Mario movie (as was Birdo, in case you were unaware), making them strong candidates for the sequel - but I'm not sure I'd call any of that bunch particularly "deep cuts". Personally, I'm down with anyone from the western release of Super Mario Bros. 2, whether that be Wart, Phanto, or even a particularly obscure throwback named Birdo.
</p>
<p>
Super Mario Bros. Move 2 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">currently scheduled to hit US cinemas on 3rd April 2026</a>. It'll see Chris Pratt reprising his role as Chris Pratt's voice, alongside the likes of Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach, Charlie Day's Luigi, Jack Black's Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key's Toad, and Seth Rogan's Donkey Kong. And if we're doing dream casting, Matt Berry as Birdo.

            <title><![CDATA[Star Citizen Developer Cloud Imperium Games Imposes 7-Day Work Week Ahead of Citizencon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games-imposes-7-day-work-week-ahead-of-citizencon.998865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Cloud Imperium Games, the developer of Star Citizen, has mandated its developers to work seven days a week to meet deadlines for Citizencon on October 19th.</p>



<p>An internal email sent to staff yesterday states that the company needs to “double down over the next 18 days to make sure that once again we create an amazing experience for our community.” This includes finalizing patch 3.24.2 for Star Citizen and having a Squadron 42 demo showcase for Chapter 1.</p>



<div><p>The email later continues, “This means for the next two weekends we will be <strong>mandating</strong> extra time for all those working on deliverables for Citcon.”</p><p>The company mandate states:</p></div>



<ul>
<li>All staff are to be in the office on Friday, October 4th and Friday, October 11th (typically a work-at-home day)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>All staff are to be in the office on Saturday, October 5th, and Saturday, October 12th (for these days, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL (time off in lieu) which can be stored and used for time off at a later date)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>All staff are to work on Sunday, October 6th, and Sunday, October 13th (this can be a work-at-home day, but the company “encourages” people to be in the office. For these days and for those in the office, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL, which can be stored and used for time off at a later date)</li>
</ul>



<div><p>Insider Gaming understands that the recent mandate is the latest in a slew of ridiculous requirements imposed on its developers due to mismanagement, leading to some leaving the company entirely. </p><p>Another internal email sent to Insider Gaming in July 2024 reveals that Cloud Imperium Games “pre-approved” 12 hours of ‘SQ42 TOIL’ per week for developers to meet Citizencon deadlines. The catch? The TOIL will only be made available after Squadron 42 ships, and employees must still be employed with the company by the time the game ships, or the TOIL “will be forfeited.”</p></div>

</p></figure>



<p>The email continues that UK employees “need to be mindful of the hours they work and are asked to have 11 hours outside of work in each 24-hour period.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming contacted Cloud Imperium Games ahead of publication and received acknowledgment but no comment on the matter.</p>



<p>However, 11 minutes after we reached out, another internal email to staff read, </p>



<p>“I want to really thank everyone who will be putting extra time over the next two weeks, it will really make a difference at Citizencon, as we will show our very best.</p>



<p>“To show our appreciation, all those who will in the trenches with us over the next couple of weekends, can have Monday 21st October on the company as a free holiday.</p>



<p>“This hopefully will give a little break for everyone to rest after our long Citizencon weekend and the drive towards it”</p>



<p>As of May 2024, Star Citizen has raised over $700 million in crowdfunding.</p>



<hr>



<p>Employee’s at Cloud Imperium Games can contact me securely and anonymously at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b2c6dddfc6dddfdad7dcd6d7c0c1dddcf2c2c0ddc6dddcdfd3dbde9cd1dddf">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> as I continue to investigate the issues at the company.</p>

It turns the iconic location, essentially where The Witcher 3 players begin their journey as protagonist Geralt after completing the White Orchard prologue, into a particularly spooky spot with carved pumpkins, black cats, and scattered bones.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Witcher 3 Halloween Mods</h3></div></output><p>Something similar has even reached the bright and sunny Toussaint, as even though this country doesn't hold the same dark and dreary spookiness as Temeria, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumpkin Patch at Corvo Bianco</a> mod from TrickArrant brings, well, a pumpkin patch to Geralt's home of Corvo Bianco.</p><p>"Pumpkin patches have always been one of my favorite parts of Fall, so I made this mod to bring that signature fall experience into the game, complete with the obligatory flannel shirt," TrickArrant wrote.</p><p>This all adds a wonderfully spooky atmosphere to The Witcher 3 but, beyond just taking it all in, NexusMods user dingchavez666 even brought players a Halloween themed quest. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saovine in Skellige</a> mod adds a quest of the same name that tasks Geralt with lighting the Saovine bonfire in Skellige ahead of their celebrations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This being The Witcher 3, however, not everything is as simple as it seems. Geralt must fend off dangerous wraiths while doing so and even comes across a spirit wolf.</p><p>These mods are just a handful of the myriad players are creating, with content creation boosted by the release of the aforementioned REDkit. This gives modders access to official assets used by CD Projekt Red and therfore allows the creation of new characters, quests, locations, and more.</p><p>Recent mods have seen players <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-mod-restores-cut-endings">restore content cut by CD Projekt Red</a>, add <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-mod-adds-full-morality-and-reputation-system">a morality and reputation system</a> that adds even more consequences to Geralt's actions, and even release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-3-mod-lets-you-play-as-fully-customizable-witcher-or-sorceress-with-new-magic-combat-system">a fully customizable character creator that lets players take on the role of a sorceress</a>.</p><p>These have breathed more life into the game while CD Projekt Red focuses on its many upcoming Witcher projects. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-entering-full-production-very-soon">The next mainline game is codenamed and Polaris</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-stars-geralt-of-rivia-but-not-as-the-main-character">will star a new protagonist</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">an entry with more mass appeal</a> is being developed at The Molasses Flood too. Fool's Theory is also developing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-devs-not-afraid-to-remove-aspects-which-are-bad-outdated-and-need-to-be-remade">a remake of the original The Witcher</a> in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>J Allard, one of the chief designers of the original Xbox, has joined Amazon, but it's too soon to say if he'll be working on anything related to video games.</p><p>Allard confirmed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260438/xbox-co-founder-j-allard-amazon-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> that he is the vice president of Amazon's devices and services team. He declined to go into specifics on what he's working on, but said he'll contribute to "new ideas." Allard's boss at Amazon is Panos Panay, the former Windows and Surface boss at Microsoft, according to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-microsoft-xbox-leader-j-allard-joins-amazon-in-latest-surprise-career-twist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GeekWire.</a></p><p>Allard is an Xbox legend, having worked at Microsoft for nearly 20 years. During his time there, he was instrumental in the formation of the team that created the original Xbox. He also led the development of Xbox Live and the Xbox 360. Additionally, Allard ran the team responsible for Microsoft's iPod competitor, the Zune. Allard left Microsoft in 2010.</p><p>Allard joined Tommy Tallarico's Intellivision as a contractor who worked with the company to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/xbox-co-founder-j-allard-left-intellivision-short-stint-hints-project-gaming-vet-brother/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">finalize the hardware design of the retro-inspired Amico console</a>. He left in summer 2020 because it was "not a good fit."</p><p>Amazon has a video game division, but it's unknown of Allard will contribute to it. The <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">devices and services team</a> he's joining runs the Alexa and Echo products, along with the game-streaming service Luna. This team also runs the Project Kuiper project that aims to launch thousands of satellites into low-earth orbit to increase broadband access around the world.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft is creating a next-gen console that aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">offer the "largest technical leap" in console history.</a> These are just words for now, as Microsoft has provided no information on how it might achieve this or any timetable for this console's release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260438/xbox-co-founder-j-allard-amazon-hiring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox cofounder J Allard joined Amazon last month as a vice president on the company’s devices and services team. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Allard confirmed his new role but says it’s “too early to have anything to say” about what he’ll be working on at Amazon beyond “new ideas.”</p><p>Allard will report to former Windows and Surface chief Panos Panay at Amazon, according <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-microsoft-xbox-leader-j-allard-joins-amazon-in-latest-surprise-career-twist/">to <em>GeekWire</em></a>. Panay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892462/amazon-hires-panos-panay-microsoft">left Microsoft</a> last year after being at the software giant for almost 20 years. Allard spent more than 20 years at Microsoft, cofounding the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;division, launching&nbsp;Microsoft’s&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;Live network, and developing the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;360 console. Allard also oversaw the development of the Zune, Microsoft’s iPod competitor.</p><p>Allard departed Microsoft in 2010, following his work on the company’s canceled Courier tablet. Courier was never officially announced as a Microsoft product, but the leaked concept combined pen and touch into a digital notepad. </p><p>The Courier was reportedly canceled amid infighting between the Courier group led by Allard and the Windows group led at the time by Steven Sinofsky. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer reportedly couldn’t choose between Courier and Windows and needed Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/1/2529666/did-bill-gates-kill-courier">step in to make the final decision</a>.</p><p>Since leaving Microsoft, Allard has spent most of his time running <a href="https://project529.com/">Project 529</a>, a community service organization focused on reducing bike theft. Two Three Bird acquired Project 529 earlier this year, freeing up Allard’s time to “orient my energy towards some new ideas.”</p><div>
