			<p>EVERSPACE 2 developer ROCKFISH Games, being headquartered in Hamburg, couldn't very well pass up on the Cologne-based Gamescom, especially since they've got the Titans DLC coming up soon. Due to launch on September 16 across all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X) for a price tag of $15, this is the first story DLC for the space combat game that was fully <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-1-0-release-date-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>I caught up with ROCKFISH Games CEO and Co-Founder Michael Schade and Communications Manager Lee Guille to learn more about EVERSPACE 2: Titans and to discuss various aspects of the industry, from their experience upgrading to Unreal Engine 5 to Game Pass and Early Access.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | TITANS DLC Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bvnx2lp7sik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the upcoming DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>Sure. EVERSPACE 2: Titans is our first story and gameplay DLC. This is going to be approximately an 8-hour experience with two different storylines. One features the Dreadnought, where players will chase this capital ship, which they will attack multiple times as they progress through the storyline. The second part is Leviathan. In the base game, we teased this creature many times with these bones found in planetary and orbital locations, so we have a new storyline that involves tracking down this creature and then getting swallowed.</p>
<p>This is also going to play into the ongoing storyline with the Redeemers, these cultists that exist in one part of space. You're going to be chasing down sightings of this creature alongside a new character. You'll have to blow up some of these cloud grades or creatures, which are one of the creature types that the Leviathan feeds on.</p>
<p>The idea here is to get yourself covered in this gross musk that the Redeemers are also harvesting, so during these experiences, you'll be fighting them off, too. There's meant to be quite a few of them out there so that every time you have an encounter with them, it's going to be different. The innards are procedurally generated. These biological environments are something that our players have never seen before. We've always been very space, very tech, very ruins-heavy. With the Leviathan, you're going to be flying inside. Each time is going to be different because it's a series of combat encounters, puzzle rooms, etc.</p>
<p>The first time you go through, it's a bit of a guided encounter through the story where you'll be fighting parasites, sometimes these drones left behind by the Redeemer cultists, and all sorts of other scary creatures down there. The objective is to go down, find lots of loot on the way, but also harvest a pearl that is at the end of the Leviathan. This kind of encounter is really appealing to players because they'll be able to do it different ways at different times and also find new resources and loot, so craftables, new consumables, new resources and all sorts of cool stuff. This puzzle here, for example, is you have to find the perfect shot and then take out all the living strands to be able to to open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Do you fight any enemies inside them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille:</strong> Absolutely. you'll be encountering all sorts of things. In addition to more mechanical enemies like the Redeemer drones, there's parasites, they're these armored barnacle-type creatures. Then there are these worms that players have seen before that sort of stick a tongue out, grab your ship, and then drag it in. As you venture inside, you'll find these imperfect pearls which will have different types of loot inside that's all randomized. Also, when you're outside of the tutorial experience, you have an agitation bar, so it pushes the players to move through the Leviathan experience quickly and also shoot accurately because if you're hitting everything, the Leviathan will want to vomit you up, and if that happens you have to begin again.</p>
<p><strong>Are these two storylines connected in any way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille:</strong> They're actually separate. At no point will you have the Leviathan fighting Dreadnought, although that would be super cool. I did ask the team if we could do it, and they said no, maybe in the future. Probably not.</p>
<p>They're like two different episodes. Both of these occur midway through the main storyline of EVERSPACE 2, so it's not postgame content; it's midgame content. Players who have finished the game can go back and find the storyline, start them, play through them, or start a new story and go from there.</p>
<p><strong>How much is EVERSPACE 2 Titans going to cost players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>The DLC will cost $15. We are sensitive to the costs of players around the world. We typically use the Steam recommended prices, but we also do manual shifts. This is all coming out on September 16, so it's very soon.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that the game was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-and-unreal-engine-5s-lumen-gi-added-to-everspace-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded</a> to Unreal Engine 5. Was it hard to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade:</strong> Yeah, it took us about six months or so. If you do such a major step from one engine to another, a lot of things break. Everything is fixable, of course, but you have to go into it. On the plus side, we didn't expect that Lumen is pretty much flipping a switch, changing some parameters, and it works right out of the box. That was great and it definitely looks better, especially if you have these bouncing light effects, so that was a big plus.</p>
<p>We saw a performance hit, so we had to go back into the performance optimization, some things that otherwise we might not have done. Now, we are pretty much where we left off, although not on all systems. It's just that the way Unreal Engine 5 handles these things is slightly different than Unreal Engine 4. This is why you see a performance hit. But other than that, the strategy was, since we have so much more content coming to EVERSPACE 2 down the line and possibly new platforms are coming. That's why we said we want the game on the latest engine to make it future-proof.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille:</strong> To speak to Lumen for a moment, we did work very closely with the Unreal Epic team to try and make sure that everything could work. Initially, our team said nah, Lumen's too hard, but as Michael said, it was just the flick of a switch and then going back and making sure that everything looks good again. The team has optimization at the top of their minds. It's very important to them, and we realized, as Michael said, we had a bit of a performance hit. So we're continuing to update, and hopefully, when Titans comes out, we will have an update that will help out some of our players across all the platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade:</strong> That being said, we don't have that many complaints about slightly lesser performance, to be honest. The vast majority of our users understand why we made the change. They'd rather take more content than worry about maybe 10% less performance. We actually had a pretty long blog post on the game's website about this whole porting process, the things that it broke, and how we fixed them. But overall, we're really pleased about how it went, and it's also preparation for whatever you do afterward. You make yourself familiar with the new tech; that's always a good thing.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We didn't expect that Lumen is pretty much flipping a switch, changing some parameters, and it works right out of the box. That was great and it definitely looks better, especially if you have these bouncing light effects.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You said there was a performance hit when you brought EVERSPACE 2 to Unreal Engine 5. Was it more noticeable on certain platforms? Is it more of an issue on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>It's more on weaker systems. I just talked to the people from Engine Software who did the console ports for us, and they said that there are certain things that allow better visuals, but they come at a price. That shows, in particular, on the systems on the lower end of the hardware spectrum. If you have a mid-to-high-end PC, then you don't see it. In fact, on some systems, we saw even better performance. If you crank up all the effects with Unreal Engine 5, it runs better than on Unreal Engine 4.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps it scales better to powerful hardware. Anyway, Lumen also offers the option to augment quality by taking advantage of hardware ray tracing. Is that something you might enable?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>The thing is, we tested hardware ray tracing when the game was on Unreal Engine 4 and found it didn't do much for us because if you fly through space and something reflects on the spaceship, you don't really see if it's super accurate or using screen space global illumination, and the reflections are so convincing. We rather take the cheaper, less performance-heavy technology.</p>
<p>It still looks amazing. I think it would be different if you have a first-person shooter where you walk inside of a building; then, you can tell if these reflections are really accurate if there's a water surface. But we don't have this in many places, so this is one of the reasons why we don't use ray tracing. And then the other is, since we're using volumetric fog for gameplay (we're hiding things in the fog), at least back then, ray tracing didn't work in conjunction with volumetric clouds.</p>
<p><strong>You plan to do more DLCs for EVERSPACE 2 after Titans, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Yeah, there's one more coming out for this one next year. We will share more info in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>I think the only thing we can say right now is that it's going to be more story-driven and much, much bigger than what Titans is.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We did say there would be new star systems and stories. We will also add a new player ship and a new campaign.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Next year's DLC will be much bigger than Titans, adding new star systems, a new player ship, and a new campaign.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>EVERSPACE 2: Titans is more about side content, as I understand it. Will the next big story DLC move the campaign forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Could be. I can't say now.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>Yep, if we share too much, our creative director will skin me alive because he pays the bill. But Titans is also going to introduce new set items, new consumables, more legendaries, and a couple of new types of weapons. There's a lot of hints in there, a lot of Easter eggs to some of ROCKFISH's past, so I think that longtime fans of the EVERSPACE series and other space games are going to enjoy this.</p>
<p><strong>EVERSPACE 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-on-october-21-full-release-delayed-to-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been on Game Pass</a> for a while, right? There is a bit of a debate in that some developers are pro-Game Pass, while others are not so favorable on the subscription service. What was your experience with it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We love Game Pass. It helped us achieve one of our best years ever and it really allowed us, because of the way Game Pass works (if you're in Game Preview, you get a chunk of money for game preview, and then we get some kind of money for a 1.0), the first chunk really allowed us in combination with revenue from Steam and other platforms to continue working on the base game for another year and make a better game. Game Pass is good for everybody. Even people on PlayStation got a better game because of our deal with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>So you don't think it hurt full-game sales in your case?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>This is what you get the money for, right? It's not like it sits in a subscription and you sell the same amount of copies as if it's not. But this is why Microsoft pays you, and we were very happy with the deal. It was fantastic. If Microsoft is interested in future content, we're very open to having a continued discussion. In fact, I analyzed when EVERSPACE 2 went on Game Pass for PC. We didn't see a decline in Steam sales. This is what those developers are worried about, but we don't see any sign of slowing down sales; it's rather the opposite. Because of the extra visibility from Game Pass, more people picked it up on Steam, and we saw a spike in sales.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>I do want to echo what Michael said there about visibility. It would be very hard to get that same level of marketing because the Xbox team was fantastic in showing the game, making sure that we were represented on their platforms and just making whole new fans of EVERSPACE.</p>
<p><strong>It's a win-win.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>In our situation, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>For us, it's a perfect combination. Early access first with our early adopters who want to be part of the journey and help us make the best game we can possibly do. We make some money off that, substantially, actually, and then we add Game Pass, and on PlayStation, we just sell the game with the classic model. So it works. It is very different, but they work together, it's not like those business models cannibalize each other.</p>
<p><strong>EVERSPACE 2 was in early access for quite a while, as you just noted. Of course, you said there will be more DLCs after Titans, but eventually, you will make another game. Do you plan to keep using the early access model, or would you rather go with a full launch immediately?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Well, I've been on record saying I will never do a game without going through early access. We're so happy with this model because, honestly, locking yourself in for five years (this is how long it takes to make a really high-end AA game), you just don't know if you are making the right game and what the fans say about it. The financial component is one thing, but the most important part of early access for us is whether we are making the right game. Is the community excited about it, are there any things that we really need to address and need to change? With EVERSPACE 2, there are a couple of things that we changed for the better because of community feedback, and this helped us have a really solid 1.0 release because, after being tested for more than two years by some 200K pilots, you get the feedback you need.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned other systems coming in the future. One of these is a Nintendo platform. Are you potentially looking to port EVERSPACE 2 to the so-called Switch 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We will absolutely look at it. I wish we knew more. It's so hard to get any info.</p>
<p><strong>It shouldn't be long now, I reckon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Yeah, we're waiting to hear more about it. Talking with the companies that specialize in porting, even they don't have the specs, so it's all a mystery to us so far. If the hardware is powerful enough, we're definitely interested, but we have to wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>Is EVERSPACE 2 verified for the Steam Deck?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>It is not, and I think there are only one or two things that are holding us back. One is that the UI, it's not scalable, and it's really hard for us, because it is such a complex UI. At this point, we might end up in a state where we support the Steam Deck, but it's never going to be verified because reworking the UI would be a huge pain point and might not be worth the hassle. So far, people are happy with how it is, but to get that verified button for such a complex game... If we had designed it from the very beginning, it would have been different, but obviously, when we were making EVERSPACE 2, there was no sign of Steam Deck, and we had to support 720P. It was not in the cards. Now, going back is really hard, so I don't want to make any promises.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We will absolutely look at the Nintendo Switch 2. If the hardware is powerful enough, we're definitely interested, but we have to wait and see. It's so hard to get any info.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What do you think about this trend of PC handhelds? Beyond the Steam Deck, several big manufacturers have entered the market lately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We love it. My previous studio was a mobile gaming studio. We also made games on mobile, and we love that. We also see other devices, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Portal</a>, that you just hang out with because your family is playing something else or watching something else on the big screen and you still want to enjoy your game.</p>
<p>I think that's a good use case. The Steam Deck and the Switch are doing great, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more handhelds on both consoles and PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the game is a good fit for the handheld experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>I think it is because, given our background of making addicting space games on mobile devices, we have a very accessible space combat. Our promise is that when you pick up the game, within a minute, you have an explosion on the screen. The controls are also designed to bring it closer to a shooter experience rather than a space simulator experience. So yeah, I think it's a great fit.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>To double up on that, there are more than a hundred handcrafted locations in EVERSPACE 2 and most of those more sidey ones you can play through and explore everything in about 20 minutes to half an hour, so it's a great pick up and play type of game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-has-playstation-finally-found-its-mascot-character<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Spoiler: We mention a few cameos that appear in Astro Bot.</strong></em></p><p>While today PlayStation’s headquarters may be located in San Mateo, California, the history of Sony’s beloved video game console brand started in the early 1990s in Tokyo, Japan. Ken Kutaragi – who would later become known as the father of PlayStation – had been working together with Nintendo on a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo. When this got canceled, Kutaragi went to Norio Ohga (Sony’s CEO at the time) with the proposal of making Sony’s own console. </p><p>“Do it!” Ohga famously said. As a result, in December 1994 the original PlayStation hit store shelves in Japan.</p><p>While Kutaragi is no longer involved with the PlayStation brand today, his legacy has not been forgotten. At Team Asobi – Sony’s inhouse development studio best known for the Astro Bot series – artwork along the walls depicts PlayStation’s 30-year journey.</p><p>“Do it! Go and make PlayStation. That was the order given to Kutaragi,” says Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet as he shows us around his studio. “Here you can see Kutaragi walking around near Tokyo Tower as he gets struck by an amazing idea of making a 32-bit machine. The rest is history.” </p><p>Needless to say, the original PlayStation was an instant hit. With over 100 million units sold, it won the console war by a large margin against industry veterans Nintendo and Sega. Sony’s PlayStation has been an almost unbeatable brand since, launching some of the most successful consoles of all time. However, there is one department that Sony could never really compete in: coming up with a brand-defining mascot character. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Astro Bot Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3>Finding a Mascot</h3><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-doesnt-have-enough-original-franchises-built-from-the-ground-up-executive-says">Sony just never seemed to have an answer</a> to Nintendo’s Mario or Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog. Crash Bandicoot was an iconic character that was exclusive to the PlayStation at the time, but he belonged to a third-party studio. And while Toro from the Doko Demo Issho series reached mascot-like status in Japan, the cute feline character was hardly known outside of PlayStation’s home country.</p><p>But maybe the PlayStation didn’t need an answer to Nintendo and Sega’s beloved mascots. Games were entering an era in which more realistic human characters like Cloud Strife, Solid Snake and Lara Croft were becoming the new industry icons. As this more mature stream of gaming culture evolved, cutesy mascot characters and the 3D platformers they called home became less and less common. When Microsoft entered the industry with the Xbox in 2001, Halo’s Master Chief instantly shaped the console’s image. Microsoft’s purchase of Rare, a studio that had created platformers with mascot-like characters for Nintendo, almost seemed like an afterthought.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We have to be aware of what makes our platform special, and iterate on that in our games.”</p></div><p>For Nintendo, however, platformers and mascot characters continue to be an essential part of its business and identity. While fans feared that Nintendo could no longer compete during the GameCube era and later the Wii U era, the house of Mario’s inventive spirit allowed it to make multiple comebacks. The combination of beloved characters and playful technology set it apart.</p><p>Today, PlayStation’s cinematic blockbuster titles still mostly cater to a mature audience, but Team Asobi is taking a different approach.  The studio’s roster of delightful robots and the inventive gameplay with which they and players interact    have been compared with the Nintendo way.</p><p>“Given Nintendo’s pop-culture standards, it’s always a nice compliment to be compared with Nintendo, but we don’t think about it too much,” Doucet says.</p><p>In the same way that Nintendo marries inventive hardware with its iconic characters, Doucet says they’re working on highlighting the PlayStation’s unique power. “PlayStation makes very high-spec machines, so we can do more advanced physics as they require a lot of calculation. We have to be aware of what makes our platform special, and iterate on that in our games.”</p><p>But utilizing the uniqueness of hardware is something that Team Asobi has always been good at – arguably more than any other PlayStation studio.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/img-20240829-143504-1725657372617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>At Team Asobi's studio, they love Astro Bot. Credit: Esra Krabbe, IGN Japan</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Originally, we didn’t think that we would go back into making games. We thought that we were going to be a unit that only does R&amp;D,” recalls Doucet. “However, some of our prototypes were received positively internally and we were asked to compile them as a preloaded game on the PS4 for people that have a PlayStation Camera.”</p><p>This became The Playroom, Team Asobi’s first game.The Playroom came preloaded with the PS4 when it launched back in 2013 and functioned as a showcase of what the PlayStation Camera and DualShock 4 controller could do. One of the mini games featured was AR Bots, a tech demo-like experience that made it seem as if 40 little robots were inside the DualShock 4. By swiping the touchpad you could throw them into the room and interact with them through the PlayStation Camera in AR, before sucking them back into the controller.</p><p>“The Playroom is now more than 10 years old, but it still makes people laugh. That’s a good sign, right?” says Doucet.</p><p>“These robots started out as bland white characters that we called AR men. When we were tasked to turn this prototype into an actual experience for players, we had to quickly come up with a character design. The fastest possible route was a robot with a simple nose, mouth and big LED eyes so that we had nothing complicated to animate.”</p><h3>Astro Bot is Born</h3><p>These were the early beginnings of what would one day become <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Team Asobi’s trademark character, Astro Bot</a>. While Shigeru Miyamoto designed Mario to match the technical limitations of the time, Astro’s simple design also came from limitations. Perhaps the simplicity of their character design is what makes both Mario and Astro so iconic and easy to recognize.</p><p>“On top of that, we wanted them to look futuristic, as the game was launching together with a new console,” says Doucet. “At the same time, we wanted these bots to have a bit of a belly so that they looked endearing and that you would want to protect them.”</p><p>It could be said that the combination of futurism with cuteness perfectly embodies the identity of the Japanese roots of the PlayStation brand that Kutaragi started. Characters like Toro, Parappa and Ape Escape’s monkeys share a somewhat similar blend of digital, cool and cute.</p><p>Team Asobi’s success with creating a game to showcase new PlayStation technology led to its next game, The Playroom VR. Similar to its predecessor, The Playroom VR was a free launch game for the PlayStation VR that functioned as a showcase for Sony’s venture into the world of virtual reality. While the team’s focus was on creating a collection of short multiplayer experiences, there was one exception.</p><p>“We had made a prototype of a 3D platformer in VR, and there was something special about it,” says Doucet. “We decided to break the rule of only including multiplayer experiences and added it to the package. It ended up being far more popular than any of the multiplayer games we focused on!”</p><p>That 3D platformer was named Robots Rescue. While no name was given to the robot you controlled, it was the first time that Astro could be seen in his final design. Robots Rescue was a short experience that consisted of just one stage, but it was so well received that Team Asobi decided to make their next game a full-fledged virtual reality 3D platformer. That became Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, released in 2018. It remains the highest rated PlayStation VR game on Metacritic to this day, with critics citing that it does for VR what Super Mario 64 did for 3D. Astro’s first full-fledged adventure instantly made both Team Asobi and Astro a force to be reckoned with.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“VR is great as it gives you a special card to play, but the audience is more limited”</p></div><p>“This is also when we came up with the name for Astro,” says Doucet. “We wanted to have a short, snappy name that is international and easy to pronounce in any language.”</p><p>Astro Bot: Rescue Mission was a huge critical success, but its exclusivity to PlayStation VR was a double-edged sword. Although VR allowed Team Asobi to differentiate its game from other 3D platformers, PS VR had a relatively small install base. For a family-friendly IP like Astro Bot, the fact that the PS VR was recommended for players over 12 also limited the game’s appeal.  </p><p>“VR is great as it gives you a special card to play, but the audience is more limited,” Doucet says. “We wanted to touch a wider audience, but that meant that we had to compete with developers that have been making 3D platformers for more than 20 or 30 years. It was a big test for us to see if we were capable of doing that or not.”</p><p>The result was Astro’s Playroom, a 3D platformer that was, once again, released as a free  game designed to showcase a new piece of hardware. It came pre-installed on the PlayStation 5 when it went on sale in 2020. It was easily one of the best games available on the system at launch. To this day, its creative use of the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers showcase what the controller can do better than pretty much any other game. Doucet tells us that while Team Asobi learned from Guerilla Games (Horizon Zero Dawn) and Santa Monica Studio (God of War), those same studios, in turn,  asked Team Asobi for advice on how to utilize  the DualSense’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.</p><p>One of the key reasons behind Astro’s Playroom’s creative use of the DualSense was Team Asobi’s close collaboration with Sony’s hardware division.</p><p>“Team Asobi’s studio is just across the street from our building, so they were always the first  to prototype with our hardware,” says Senior Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki, product director for the DualSense controller.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/img-20240829-143648-1725657541729.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The history of PlayStation affects Team Asobi's work deeply. Credit: Esra Krabbe, IGN Japan</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Whenever we had something ready at the hardware team, we would just call Team Asobi and hand it to them,” Aoki explains. “A few days later they would call us back to show us something. With this quick loop, they could give us feedback on what they wanted added to or removed from the hardware.”</p><p>Aoki continues, “For our hardware, we want to give the player a new experience rather than just a piece of technology. In that regard, working closely with Team Asobi really helped us.”</p><p>The ever-growing install base of the PS5 has allowed many players around the world to enjoy Astro’s Playroom. Filled with references to hardware throughout PlayStation’s history and boasting an abundance of cameo appearances from popular characters, Astro’s Playroom celebrated PlayStation’s history in a unique way. This made Astro not just the new kid on the block, but established the bot as a character integral  to the PlayStation brand. </p><h3>Gaining Icon Status</h3><p>As the PS5 is still a platform with a relatively mature audience, Sony likely doesn’t have the intention to cement Astro as the system’s one and only mascot. But maybe they should? A new iconic character representing your brand through top-quality games couldn’t possibly be a bad thing. Especially since a family-friendly 3D platformer like Astro Bot is also the type of game that the PlayStation’s library has been lacking.</p><p>“For Astro’s Playroom, there have mainly been two types of audiences,” says Doucet. “First, there are the people who actually are gamers. You hear more from them because they are generally more vocal. They’re mostly the type who crave more colorful games and want to go back to 3D platformers. These players are also happy to see how we treat the PlayStation heritage. </p><p>“But then, there’s a whole different type of audience that we hear from through more intimate communication,” Doucet reveals. “People come and tell us it became their kid’s first game or that they played it with their daughter or son. Many people buy a PS5 for themselves, but play Astro’s Playroom with their younger children.”</p><p>The fact that Team Asobi’s games have the potential to become someone’s first game is something that Doucet takes seriously.</p><p>“I grew up playing games like Mega Man and Castlevania. From music to gameplay and even the package art, these games will stay in my heart forever. The hard work and care of the creators has become a part of many people’s lives. We have the same opportunity with Astro, which is something we do not take lightly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Astro’s Playroom’s success allowed Team Asobi to get the green light for a full-scale 3D platformer. Releasing on September 6, Team Asobi’s newest game is simply titled Astro Bot. While Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Astro’s Playroom both benefited from the marvel of new technology (VR and DualSense respectively), Astro Bot feels more like a direct evolution of Astro’s Playroom.</p><p>“We made a lot of prototypes at the time, but the game was too small to put all our ideas in,” says Principal gameplay Programming Lead Masayuki Yamada. “Our newest game has all of the best ideas we had to leave out at the time, as well as plenty of new creative ideas. In that sense it has much more volume, and what we can do with the haptic feedback has evolved a lot as well. On top of that, we're doubling down on showcasing PlayStation’s heritage through hardware references and cameos of beloved characters in new ways, too.”</p><p>According to Jamie Smith, Team Asobi’s Principle Animation Director, the animations of Astro and other characters in the game have been drastically increased. While animation in Astro’s Playroom was simple and limited, this time around the team has gone the extra mile by adding significantly more detail through a wider variation of walk and run motions, swimming underwater, climbing vertical cables and ladders, tons of idle animations and much more. These additions enrich the gameplay while further establishing Astro as a character. Seeing Astro take out and play his PS One or being frightened to death in a horror-themed stage adds to his charm in classic mascot character fashion.</p><p>Cameos have more detailed animations too. Smith named Trico and the boy from The Last Guardian as an example.</p><p>“If you hit Trico, it will wake up and go back to sleep; but if you hit the boy, Trico will wake up and be protective over the boy like in The Last Guardian. We really wanted to go deeper and depict the relationship between characters.”</p><p>The biggest evolution of the cameo characters, however, is that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs">four of them will actually lend you their weapons,</a> which Astro needs to use in stages specifically designed for each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“People come and tell us it became their kid’s first game or that they played it with their daughter or son."</p></div><p>“We call these characters PlayStation heroes. They are trapped in boss battles, so you need to defeat the boss to save them,” Doucet explains. “For these PlayStation heroes, we wanted to have a mix of characters from blockbusters and more classic fantasy characters. Since Astro is designed as a family-friendly game that anyone can pick up and play, we wanted these special stages to have simplified game design when compared to the franchise they are based on. Another thing is that we wanted there to be humor. For example, we tried to make [God of War’s] Kratos angry and cute at the same time.”</p><p>While more of an extension of its previous titles than something all-new, it sounds like Team Asobi has cooked another stellar game. With over 80 stages and more than 15 power ups, players that wanted more of Astro’s Playroom will unlikely be dissatisfied. It will also be interesting to see what kind of new experiences Team Asobi can deliver with its deep knowledge of the DualSense controller. By paying respect to PlayStation’s heritage in new interactive ways, Astro Bot also seems like the perfect game to mark PlayStation’s 30th anniversary. </p><p>“I was at [Tokyo electronics store] Yodobashi Camera last Sunday and saw a father and his son preorder Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Astro Bot,” says Doucet. “Clearly, he bought Call of Duty for himself, while Astro Bot was probably for his son. It was the first time I saw someone buy Astro Bot with my own eyes.”</p><p>Like Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot is not just a game that PS5 owners can play themselves, but also one that they can share with their less-experienced loved ones. Will this new adventure bring Astro even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-apparently-thinking-about-a-sequel-already">closer to mascot character status?</a> If the father and son Doucet saw at Yodobashi Camera is an indication, Astro could very well be on his way to familiarize a younger audience with the PlayStation brand.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://twitter.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

<p>As announced by Larian Studios' Swen Vincke, "modding is pretty big - we had more than a million mods installed in less than 24 hours".</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, however, ModDB and mod.io founder Scott Reismanis popped up in Vincke's <a href="https://x.com/scottreismanis/status/1832379012179751132">mentions</a> to say, "just ticked over 3m installs and accelerating".</p>
<p>Patch 7 adds new evil endings, the studio's own Mod Manager, wherein you can browse, install, and use mods created by the community, and some revamped split-screen gameplay.</p> <div>

<p>"Our goal is to do cross-platform modding support, which is not the easiest thing in the world because we have to make it work on consoles and on PC," Vincke recently explained.</p>
<p>"We'll start with the PC version. The console version will come a bit later because it has to go through a bunch of submission processes. It also gives us the time to see whatever goes wrong and fix it."</p>

            <p>In a change to a previous statement, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> says it will be "reprinting" Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition on PS5 physical disc after all.</p>
<p>Last week, Annapurna announced there had "been a glitch in the time loop", and the PS5 physical edition of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-physical-editions-of-outer-wilds-archaeologist-edition-have-the-wrong-version-of-the-game-on-them">Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition had been printed with "the wrong version of the game"</a>, and the Echoes of the Eye expansion was unknowingly omitted from the disc.</p>
<p>In recompense, the company invited players to contact iam8bit's customer support team with proof of purchase to receive a DLC voucher code, which - as some collectors pointed out - nullified the point of owning a physical copy of the game in the first place.</p>

<p>Annapurna has apologised to fans again and says it is "striving to deliver physical editions that honour and quality and craft of their games".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the company said in additional to its previous plan to offer a digital voucher for the missing DLC, it was now also offering fans the chance to return their discs for the complete edition.</p>
<p>"We will be reprinting the Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition for PS5 with the Echoes of the Eye expansion complete on disc," the team explained.</p>
<p>"If you do NOT want a digital resolution, we advise you to return your physical edition to the retailer from which it was purchased as soon as possible (or cancel your order if you haven't yet received it)."</p>
<p>From next week, Annapurna says players can place "a new order for a corrected physical copy of Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition directly from a partnering online storefront".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Early development gameplay from 2022 of the Crazy Taxi reboot has been leaked online showcasing its multiplayer elements.</p>



<p>The new leaked footage comes courtesy of X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/ryanfrombronx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ryanfrombronx</a>, who uploaded the 33-second clip to his profile. According to Ryan, the footage is early development footage that was captured in 2022. You can see the gameplay below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ryan continues to say in the thread that the game is coming to “all modern platforms and the successor to the current Nintendo Switch in 2027”. This means that the Crazy Taxi reboot will be coming to the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, SEGA confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-new-crazy-taxi-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crazy Taxi will be an open-world multiplayer game</a>. The development team had difficulty pivoting from a single-player experience to a live-service multiplayer model, but the game is now progressing very well. Previously, Midori, who was an account created by Ryan, has claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crazy Taxi reboot is being developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>SEGA announced <span>in December 2023 that it was developing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five new games:</a>&nbsp;Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi. Insider Gaming understands that more classic games are being developed and&nbsp;</span>revived.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, Final Fantasy XVI, and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-i-ii-iii-the-power-of-nostalgia/"> Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</a> are on the docket for Xbox consoles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zEasbCMi2rI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Two podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden commented on the Square Enix series and the possibility of the latest entries getting released on Xbox consoles, saying that he has heard that the whole slate is on the docket. As for when they are going to be released, Corden could not say, although he thinks that something related to the series will be revealed during Microsoft's event at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Additionally, he heard that the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy hasn't been locked down by Sony, so it will come to Xbox at some point, though when it is not yet known. Given how the series is still incomplete, Square Enix will likely wait until the third and final entry in the trilogy is out before porting to Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Tokyo Game Show | Xbox and Capcom Deal | Concord Disaster - XB2 330" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEasbCMi2rI?start=4058&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given the current state of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's extremely likely that Final Fantasy XVI will be the next entry in the series to launch on Xbox consoles following the launch of Final Fantasy XIV earlier this year. Seeing how the game doesn't run particularly well on the more powerful PlayStation 5, it will be very interesting to see how Square Enix handles the Xbox Series S version.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is Rebirth, released earlier this year on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>

<p>I also had some quick thoughts and impressions on the racing two-fer of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/endurance-motorsport-series-preview-a-gentleman-driver-and-a-scholarly-engineer/"><strong>Endurance Motorsport Series</strong></a> and Nacon’s first racing wheel, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/hands-on-the-revosim-pure-nacons-first-high-end-racing-wheel/"><strong>Revosim Pure</strong></a>.

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Now then, what have you all been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww’s</strong> had a stressful week, but thankfully found some time for some gaming with Horizon Forbidden West. Unfortunately, that included the anxiety inducing size of the game, so after 30 hours in, he’s only 33% completed, and it’s leaving PS Plus soon!</li>
<li>And <strong>MrYd</strong> has played mostly Diablo 4 and Balatro of late, before this week’s appearance of Vampire Survivors on PlayStation, which has been a lot of fun so far. Oh, and he met Sir Ian Livingstone of Fighting Fantasy fame at work!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Keep dry and warm, Keep your eyes peeled for everything we’ll be churning out over the next few days and weeks!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/new-skaven-warhammer-miniatures-review-rats-off-to-ya</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-skaven-warhammer-miniatures-review-rats-off-to-ya.974652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/new-skaven-warhammer-miniatures-review-rats-off-to-ya<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Skittering in from the darkest reaches of the Mortal Realms come the Skaven, terrible rat-men bent on causing mass chaos. We saw Skaven in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set">kick off to the new edition of <em>Age of Sigmar</em></a>, and now Games Workshop has sent along the Skaven Codex and a heap of new models for me to check out. I’ve got a lot to cover, so I’m trying out a new format here! Tell me what you think in the comments, and read on for my New Skaven <em>Warhammer</em> Miniatures Review.</p>
<h3><b>Acolyte Globadiers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/acolyte-globadiers.jpg?itok=EBjfx4XZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/acolyte-globadiers.jpg?itok=3AOls7Bf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Acolyte Globadiers do best:</strong> These Clan Skryre troops are great at thinning out a crowd with their Anti-Infantry Poisoned Wind Globes, which gain 1 extra Damage when attacking enemy units with 10 or more models.</p>
<p><strong>How to run them:</strong> Keep them close to other Clanrats to use their somewhat incongruous Hidden Weapon Team ability (which makes them invisible to enemies more than 13” away), but get them in the mix as crowd control. Consider further buffing their poison attack for max whittling down but beware, once they face off against smaller number units they lose their effectiveness pretty quickly.</p>
<h3><b>Arch-Warlock</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arch-warlock.jpg?itok=A5294yog 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arch-warlock.jpg?itok=2332FtQF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Arch-Warlock does best:</strong>&nbsp;Being a brute with decent melee weapon skills (and a Warpfire Gauntlet that can shoot in combat) who can <i>also</i> use 1 spell.</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:&nbsp;</strong>I really think you just want to pair a bunch of these Arch-Warlock’s with your rats to help dish out some real damage and use their Overseers of the Enginecovens special ability to make it so nearby Skryre units don’t spend command points when using the ‘Covering Fire’ command. Pretty straightforward, honestly.</p>
<h3><b>Brood Terror</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brood-terror.jpg?itok=uxcW3t8L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brood-terror.jpg?itok=TUhT2_wM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Brood Terror does best:</strong>&nbsp;Looking absolutely, gleefully disgusting on the tabletop. Also... smashing opponents.</p>
<p><strong>How to run it: </strong>All jokes aside, this amalgam of rotting rat flesh can dish out extreme melee damage, and has a powerful 15” ranged Warpflame Scourger. Just plop it down anywhere and let it do real damage to your opponents.</p>
<h3><b>Doom-Flayers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-flayers.jpg?itok=Unv0N0fG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-flayers.jpg?itok=d00UwpD0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Doom-Flayers do best:</strong> As you’d expect from a rat on a giant wheel, the Doom-Flayer is best at moving <i>fast</i> on the battlefield (with a 2d6+3” move speed).</p>
<p><strong>How to run them: </strong>For the Doom-Flayers, it’s all about the Charge. Cover the distance, slam into your foes with a charge for extra damage, and use their special ability after your charge to sneak in some mortal wounds! It’s the perfect on-the-go option!</p>
<h3><b>Krittok Foulblade</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krittok-foulblade.jpg?itok=gPL98C00 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krittok-foulblade.jpg?itok=CSDxnyqo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What Krittok Foulblade does best:</strong> Krittok, a unique Verminus hero, gains most of his power from his possessed dagger Dooming - and what he does best on the battlefield is… slice and chop his opponents with Doomfang!</p>
<p><strong>How to run him:</strong> Krittok has some nice buffering abilities for those around him, including beefing up the wound roles. But because he has such a nice melee weapon, you’ll want him close by (and protected by) other units of fodder.</p>
<h3><b>Master Moulder</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/master-moulder.jpg?itok=cdyx3SyH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/master-moulder.jpg?itok=T5Z5FncI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Master Moulder does best:</strong> Healing abominations - which makes sense, since they're the ones who made them.</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:</strong> The Master Moulder truly runs best as a support system for your larger, more valuable and punishing Moulder units. If you run him (and I’m not sure you need to, to be honest), you’ll want him primarily healing and adding to other units’ charge values.</p>
<h3><b>Stormvermin</b></h3>

<p><strong>How to run them:</strong> If you have the points in your army list, you would do well to swap in a few of units of Stormvermin, but know that these slightly more advanced Clanrats (better save at 4+, and 3 attacks instead of 2) won’t truly move the needle for your army.</p>
<h3><b>Vizzik Skour, Prophet of the Horned Rat</b></h3>

Crazy prayers and special abilities that basically rip apart your foe! Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>How to run him:</strong> While his attacks and all his abilities are super strong, his special ability ‘Fissures in Reality’ punishes enemies for being locked in combat with him. So don’t be afraid, even though he’d be a big, expensive centerpiece in your army, to move in for the kill and start attacking your enemies head on. In essence, don’t be precious with Vizzik!</p>
<h3><b>Warlock Galvaneer</b></h3>

Also, looking like he's absolutely shredding with that blaster of his!</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:</strong>&nbsp;Pair him up with the classic Warpvolt Scourgers and the Galvaneer can actually buff the attacks of those models by overcharging their weapons with electricity (which is hilarious to imagine). But as mentioned above, where you really want this unit to shine is by dishing out heavy ranged damage, and then using their special ability ‘More-More Warpvolt Doom!’ (Lol) to chain lightning attacks to other nearby enemy units!</p>
<h3><b>Warp-Grinder</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warp-grinder.jpg?itok=O9ngbHEk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warp-grinder.jpg?itok=Bz8P8fn4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Warp-Grinder does best:</strong> Popping onto the battlefield at moments most inopportune for your opponent!</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:</strong> This is <i>such</i> a cool concept for a model. Essentially, they’ve got a giant drill that can tear through the fabric of reality. During deployment, you set them and one other friendly non-Monster unit up “In the Tunnels Below” (aka in reserve). Then, later, they can pop up right next to an enemy unit! This is absolutely fantastic for catching your enemies off guard.</p>
<h2>New Skaven <em>Warhammer</em> Miniatures - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Phew! Thanks for joining me on that sprint through ten new Skaven <em>Warhammer</em> models up for preorder this week from Games Workshop. What do I think of all of these? As you can maybe glean from a lot of my quick-looks above, I'm really enamored with a lot of these models. While some don't necessarily break the mold here, most are extremely varied in how they enhance your Skaven army.</p>

<p>In January 2023, Gaimin Gladiators issued a statement against Ubisoft’s management of the Rainbow Six Siege scene and pulled out of the ecosystem. It said that it had suffered from a ‘lack of info from Ubisoft’, and at the time, many other organisations dropped out of the running. </p>



<p>Now, Gaimin Gladiators is back after acquiring the former roster of Team Bliss, marking a return to the Rainbow Six scene after more than 21 months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-the-game">Back in the Game</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Gaimin Gladiators revealed the signing of the former Team Bliss squad:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wettables</li>



<li>Fishoguy</li>



<li>Sageon</li>



<li>Brendo</li>



<li>Tuhan</li>
</ul>



<p>The organisation has also picked up Titan, Mingoran, and Golden in management and team coaching capacities.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following an entry into Rainbow Six Siege in 2022, Gaimin Gladiators failed to make waves, and less than a year later, the organisation withdrew from the landscape. There are high hopes that the team can make something of this refreshed run, as Team Bliss has been infinitely more successful and has made it to the stage at the Six Invitational and several BLAST R6 Major events.</p>



<p>Most recently, the squad appeared at the Six Invitational in Sao Paolo and at the BLAST R6 MAnchester Major. They even took a spot in the competition at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>It was a long time coming, but it’s a shrewd time to break back into Rainbow Six Siege. This has been a brilliant year for the game’s competitive ecosystem, and thanks to constant backing by Ubisoft, the title continues to evolve positively. </p>

<p>The organising body behind Vietnam’s ‘VCS’ league has posted on social media regarding the sudden death of Nguyen ‘EGO’ Khanh Hoa. On September 5, the two-time champion died after suffering a heart attack at just 21 years of age. The former MVP-grade player represented Team Flash, CERBERUS, and Saigon Buffalo during his time in the League of Legends esports scene.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rising-star">Rising Star</h2>



<p>Per EGO’s profile, the talented player started competing when he was just 17 years old, making a name for himself in Vietnam as a prodigy of sorts. In his first competitive split, EGO secured an MVP award and won a title in the VCS – the Vietnam Championship Series. He would go on to win again the following year, in 2021.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Despite a successful regional streak, EGO announced his retirement from competing in 2023, just four years after he debuted. It wasn’t made clear why he was retiring so early, and the decision came before he’d landed the chance to compete on an international stage.</p>



<p>This former Jungler will be remembered for his stellar in-game talents, which earned him a Rookie of the Split award in 2020. Our condolences go out to his friends and family at this difficult time.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-odyssey-images-leak-online/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-blizzard%E2%80%99s-cancelled-survival-game-%E2%80%98odyssey%E2%80%99-leak-online.974619/</guid>

<p>In 2023, discussions surfaced regarding a developing survival game that Blizzard was working on. It was previously claimed that the game would resemble Everwild, took inspiration from Fable Legends, and was being compiled with the concept of it being a ‘fairytale survival game’.</p>



<p>Fast forward to January 2024, and Odyssey had been cancelled, with it being claimed that the studio was facing ‘insurmountable issues’ with the game engine that they’d been developing since 2017.</p>



<p>Now, images of the beleaguered, forgotten project have reportedly surfaced online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-we-ll-get">The Best We’ll Get</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://vk.com/wall-23323356_38723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VK.com</a>, a Russian social media site, a series of images were uploaded by a user who claimed they were of Project Odyssey, Blizzard’s failed survival game.</p>



<p>In the shots, we see a multiplayer-based game that’s easily recognisable as a ‘generic’ survival title. The player has a series of tools and weapons in their possession, they’re able to manage an inventory packed with resources and other items, and on a ‘status’ screen, we see elements like warmth, buffs and debuffs, food, and sleep levels. </p>



<p>It looks as though Project Odyssey would have been highly customisable, starting with the base character model and then working up through clothing, loadout, and skill points and levels. It would have had a ‘cartoony’ aesthetic not too dissimilar to Palworld, and judging from the UI, players would have been able to use a series of powers and abilities.</p>



<p>In the screenshots, we can also see what looks like a ‘killfeed’, suggesting that Odyssey would have had PvP elements. In one image, a player has died after being shot by another user, and they’re given the option to choose their respawn point, one of which is as far as ‘822 steps away’, suggesting that the map was a fair size.</p>



<p>They also lost their carried gear and some durability of equipped gear when they passed, which is another typical survival-MMO mechanic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, <strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/nm4OUE9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">these leaked images</a> </strong>are the closest we’ll ever get to Odyssey.</p>



<p>Do you think this would have been a good game?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-difficulty-settings/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-black-myth-wukong-have-difficulty-settings.974598/</guid>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong took the gaming space by storm and, honestly, much of the world. It’s one of the most successful video games to hail from China and does an exceptional job of unveiling Chinese mythology to the masses. Despite many claiming it’s not a Soulslike, it absolutely is a Soulslike. I’ll die on this hill. So, does Black Myth: Wukong have difficulty settings? Can you make the game easier or more challenging if you’d like?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-raise-or-lower-the-difficulty-in-black-myth-wukong">Can You Raise or Lower the Difficulty in Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no difficulty settings option in Black Myth: Wukong. The game doesn’t follow the traditional Easy, Medium, or Hard scale of game difficulty but utilizes its own internal difficulty settings to challenge players to an extraordinary experience. However, it follows the same gameplay style as Elden Ring or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. You can’t lower the difficulty to make life easier, but you can practice and repeat sections of the game to improve your skills. </p>



<p>Furthermore, as in Elden Ring, you can farm zones and enemies in Black Myth: Wukong to level up and make the game slightly more approachable, albeit still tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-hard-is-black-myth-wukong">How Hard is Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll be frank: Black Myth: Wukong provides quite the challenge. If you’re an inexperienced Soulslike player, or if you were tricked by the many reviews that said the game isn’t Soulslike but is an “action RPG,” which is total bull, then you’re likely feeling the sting of the game’s difficulty. </p>



<p>There’s one boss in particular, in one of the early-game zones, by the name of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-1-billion-steam-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wandering Wight</a>. It’s one of the most infuriating boss fights for a new player, and he’s begging you to challenge him. But you’re not supposed to beat him on the first encounter. You’re meant to return at a later time. The game features numerous bosses similar to this one—a lot of optional boss fights.</p>



<p>If you’re not a fan of the Soulslike genre, especially if you grow weary or angry when you don’t progress quickly enough, then perhaps skip Black Myth: Wukong!</p>

<p>With so many people enjoying the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta gameplay, players with some computer know-how want to ensure their systems run the game as optimally as imaginable. With that said, here’s a look at the Black Ops 6 system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-system-requirements">What Are the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 System Requirements?</h2>



<p>Besides the massive storage space requirements, the system requirements for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 don’t appear too egregious. With the backing of Activision and Microsoft, one would expect a highly optimized first-person shooter, and that’s often what we receive each year. Make any argument you want, but Call of Duty usually runs well on most systems at launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1400 / Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 470</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X / Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT / Intel Arc A770</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>:  149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-the-system-requirements-change-before-launch">Will the System Requirements Change Before Launch?</h2>



<p>While it’s unlikely that the game’s system requirements will change, especially considering so many of us are already enjoying the game during the beta, there’s still a slim chance. The studio could make behind-the-scenes improvements that optimize the core experience and reduce the hardware requirements. They could also include some files that bloat the storage space requirements.</p>



<p>It’s entirely up in the air whether the PC system requirements for Black Ops 6 will change, but I find it unlikely.</p>

<p>With Final Fantasy XVI finally coming to PC, we’re looking at the latest RPG from Square Enix—previously only available on PS5—and we’re impressed so far. It looks gorgeous, and the PC features appear worthy, but how are the Final Fantasy XVI system requirements? Can your system run the game successfully?</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-xvi-pc-system-requirements">Final Fantasy XVI PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>Overall, the Final Fantasy XVI system requirements don’t appear too egregious. That is, until you spot the storage requirements! This massive game will eat up your SSD in one big gulp, so hopefully, you have enough room to accommodate yet another extensive RPG!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 / Intel Core i5 8400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 5700 / Intel Arc A580 / Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 170 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X / Intel Core i7-10700</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT / Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 170 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-does-final-fantasy-xvi-have-controller-support-on-pc">Does Final Fantasy XVI Have Controller Support on PC?</h2>



<p>When Final Fantasy XVI launches on PC on September 17, it will do so with complete controller support from the get-go. You can use a DualShock, DualSense, or an Xbox Series X|S controller—even a third-party controller you scored for a few bucks from Walmart—to play the RPG. </p>



<p>It’s probably best to play with a controller. After all, this is a console RPG designed for the PS5 and is now being ported over to the PC!</p>

Sony's troubled live service game didn't even last two weeks, failing to fill its beta and launching to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">tragically low concurrent count on Steam</a>. Ultimately it is estimated to have<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"> only sold around 25,000 units</a>, which is extraordinarily low by first-party release standards.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Concord servers are now offline.</p><p>Thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the Concord galaxy. <a href="https://t.co/o1dTywrqUx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/o1dTywrqUx</a></p></div>— Concord (@PlayConcord) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayConcord/status/1832107824295629044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l3bffz4jjx25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Bluesky</a>, Circana executive director Mat Piscatella called Concord's shutdown "unprecedented," nothing that even Anthem was the best-selling game of February 2019 and is still playable today. Asked how it compares to the likes of The Day Before and Crucible, two other games that were shuttered soon after release, Piscatella said that this "one reads differently to me than anything that's come before," describing it as being "soundly rejected" by players.</p><p>It makes Concord one of the most remarkable news stories of the year — a first party release that ultimately never had a chance.</p><h2>Does Concord have a future as a free-to-play game?</h2><p>Still, at least some fans are wondering if there's a future for Sony's shooter. Could Concord work as a free-to-play game? That's been one of the main questions on platforms like X/Twitter and Resetera as fans debate the path ahead for Sony. Even before Concord shut down, Forbes writer Paul Tassi called its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/28/free-to-play-concord-is-inevitable-but-will-it-change-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transition to free-to-play "inevitable,"</a> though wondered if it would change things. </p><p>There are certainly plenty of sticking points. The roster failed to resonate with fans, and the art style and writing has variously been described as a kind of off-brand Guardians of the Galaxy. There's also little in terms of innovation to differentiate Concord from other hero shooters. In a market flooded with live service games, success is increasingly a zero sum game, and Concord was on the wrong side of the divide.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>On the one hand, the game and the IP were just so soundly rejected of it that one may think it unsalvageable</p></div><p>Nevertheless, we found points to like about Concord. In our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review">review</a>, we described the competitive gameplay as "fantastic" and praised its map design. In its closing days, a collection of trophy hunters made a last second dash to try and grab what will soon be one of PlayStation's rarest Platinums, even going so far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown">throw themselves off cliffs to grind XP</a>.</p><p>So will it return? One <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-sales-ceasing-immediately-offering-refunds-to-all-customers-the-game-will-be-taken-offline-beginning-sept-6th-check-staff-post.970872/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resetera</a> user opines. "I'm guessing it'll probably end up going F2P and then quietly shuttered if it doesn't find an audience quickly. Doing that's going to be a hell of a task though as the game was designed around progress not being monetised. I feel terrible for Firewalk, all that time invested into what's apparently a pretty decent game to have this happen straight after launch. I have a horrible feeling that there's going to be some layoffs coming soon."</p><p>Piscatella, for his part, is uncertain. "On the one hand, the game and the IP were just so soundly rejected of it that one may think it unsalvageable. On the other hand, so few know about the game that perhaps it could be brought back with a different model and a significant refresh. I think this is an unprecedented situation, with all options on the table, so anyone's guess is probably as good as mine."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>What's next for Sony</h2><p>For what it's worth, Concord isn't completely finished. As we reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source">Concord is still set to appear in Secret Level</a>, the upcoming Prime Video anthology series by Tim Miller that also features the likes of God of War, Mega Man, and Warhammer 40K. While it seems unlikely that it will re-ignite interest in the property, it does represent at least one spark of life for the franchise.</p><p>The future of Firewalk Studios, for its part, is unclear. The studio behind Concord was established as part of ProbablyMonsters in 2018 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">acquired by PlayStation in 2023</a>. Design director Josh Hamrick <a href="https://x.com/Josh_Hamrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted throughout the week</a>, thanking fans and signing off when the servers went down with "FREEGUNNER FOR LIFE."</p><p>At one point he wrote wistfully, "I started at Firewalk in the Spring of 2019. We were less than a dozen devs working shoulder to shoulder in a friend's attic."</p><p>Sony, meanwhile, has more free-to-play games on the way, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fairgame-is-the-first-game-from-jade-raymonds-haven-studios">Fairgame$</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Bungie's Marathon</a>. Marathon has already had its share of problems, at one point being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">forced to replace its director amid layoffs and other problems</a>. Little has been shown of Fairgame$ outside of a CG trailer, but GI.biz's Chris Dring recently said that he's been hearing positive buzz about the game. One way or another, the future of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">Sony's live service strategy is uncertain</a>, though PlayStation can claim at least one victory thanks to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">success of Helldivers 2</a> in the first part of the year (though it has also struggled of late).</p><p>For now, Sony can take comfort in Astro Bot, which is both single-player and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">receiving rave reviews</a>. As for whether Concord will ever get another chance of its own, we'll just have to see.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Now, he’s built a crystal ball filled with shimmering, spinning volumetric light — and of course he’s playing <em>Doom</em> on it. </p><p>But not just any <em>Doom</em>. <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-voxel-project/addons/voxel-doom">Voxel Doom</a>, where every dot of the game’s graphics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">lives in 3D space</a>, just like the dots of the volumetric display he’s created. </p><p>As he explains on YouTube, the physical illusion is fairly simple: “It’s like a hologram fan, but instead of spinning a 1D strip to make a 2D image, it spins a 2D panel to make a 3D image.” On his Mastodon, he breaks it down a bit more <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ancientjames/112597046453214197">with visual aids</a>: </p><p>Brown’s been working on this for over a year now: if I’m not mistaken, he introduced the project in August 2023 <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ancientjames/110948067275036967">by channeling his inner Doc Brown</a>, saying “If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 300rpm you’re going to see some serious shit.” But he’s since discovered it needs to spin a good bit faster than that for a smooth image, particularly when he’s trying to film it. So keep your fingers away.</p><p>You can follow his progress <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ancientjames">on his Mastodon,</a> where he’s not <em>just</em> playing <em>Doom — </em>you can find volumetric lunar landers and skulls and dino heads, for example. He just published this to his YouTube too:</p><div><p>When we first checked in with Brown, he’d just finished putting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/20/23308217/lego-brick-computer-james-brown">real computers inside Lego computer bricks</a>:</p></div><div><p><cite>GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge; Video by James Brown</cite></p></div><p>And yes, they can play <em>Doom.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions/" data-ref-id="5000-631815">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a> has finally delivered fans of the Wizarding World a proper Quidditch sports game, and so it only makes sense that broom customization will be a major factor in the experience. Ideally, you'll be spending the entirety of every Quidditch match on one, after all. But every broom that's available to choose from has its pros and cons--there's no one-size-fits-all choice to be made here. To pick the best broom in Quidditch Champions for you, you'll have to figure out what works best for your style of play and the positions that your characters are playing.</p><h2>Best Broom in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</h2><p dir="ltr">When you first get started with Quidditch Champions, you'll have three brooms by default: the <strong>Shooting Star</strong>, the <strong>Cleansweep</strong>, and the <strong>Comet</strong>. There are currently seven others available to unlock by various means, like completing challenges or buying the deluxe edition or progressing through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">the seasonal rewards</a>. But you don't need to sweat those unlocks--the basic brooms have better stats, at least to begin with, so you don't need any of those others if you're just concerned with effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">Brooms have three main stat categories--speed, durability and agility--and each of the three basic brooms is good in two of those categories and poor in the third. The Comet has high agility and high durability but low speed. The Cleansweep has high agility and high speed but low durability. The Shooting Star has high speed and high durability but low agility. You can upgrade them using Moonstones, one of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-how-to-get-more-winged-keys/1100-6526307/" data-ref-id="1100-6526307">three main currencies</a>, but there's an opportunity cost involved in doing so because you upgrade each broom separately--if you blow all your Moonstones on Shooting Star, you won't have anything to upgrade your Comet.</p><p dir="ltr">But because of how the brooms are balanced, it's not ideal to simply pick one to put all your Moonstones into. You'll need to upgrade all three of them, because each of the three main brooms fills a niche. The way each position plays will be the biggest factor, but your playstyle also matters, so keep that in mind as you read the rest of this.</p><p dir="ltr">For my money, <strong>the Shooting Star is best for chasers</strong>, whose main job is to get downfield quickly and without getting knocked out. But since you have three chasers, it's not the worst idea to throw in one Cleansweep among them so you can have a point guard who can fly circles around everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">I also enjoy the Shooting Star for beaters who like to roam all over, <strong>but a beater who stays on their own team's end of the field may be better suited with a Comet</strong>. But this one is very subjective--what really matters here is you pick a broom with high durability. The other stat is more of a personal choice.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For a seeker, the choice is very easy; </strong>you need the speed and maneuverability of the Cleensweep. If you want to have any hope of catching the snitch before Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you'll need to make full use of the Cleansweep's speed and maneuverability.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the keeper will need a Comet because its high maneuver speed is necessary for hopping between the three goals you're defending, and its high durability is also essential--it would be <em>really </em>bad if your keeper got knocked out.</p><p dir="ltr">As you play, be sure to regularly upgrade your brooms. You'll receive 15 Moonstones every time you increase your career level, which happens basically every match, so you'll have your equipment in great shape very quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is developed by Unbroken Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is tangentially related to Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.

High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has returned to YouTube - two months after admitting he exchanged "messages with an individual minor" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" - accusing critics of a "planned and coordinated attack", and asking, "Did any of you consider [they] may have been over the legal age of consent?".
</p>
<p>
Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> when the publication spoke with two former Twitch employees.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy response at the time, Beahm said, "I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban. Were there Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not."

<p>
"These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," Beahm continued, "but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with Twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me."
</p>
<p>
Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - has <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. But now, after a period away from the spotlight, a clearly agitated Beahm has returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Breahm admits, comes ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his previously de-monetised channel. 
</p>
<p>
In a 20-minute diatribe mixing prepared statement and seemingly unplanned outburst, Beahm referred to Conners as a "fucking rat", insisting he "wasn't even involved" in the Twitch investigation that would see him <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">banned from the platform</a>. Beahm also repeatedly disputed accusations a minor had been involved in the incident that led to his ban from Twitch, asking, "When you and all these so-called journalists, Cody, fired off your tweets, did any of you consider that the Twitch user may have been over the legal age of consent at the time of the messages?" This is despite the fact Beahm himself previously admitted to sending "Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017".
</p>
<p>
Beahm also insisted he "never intended to meet" the user involved in the accusations, and "never made plans to meet at TwitchCon", instead saying, "I suspect all of you sort of planned and coordinated this attack. These big-time publications, these journalists... act like they're just gossip channels now, without any real journalism, and real research happening."
</p>
<p>
Beahm went on to claim he was deliberately targeted by a former Twitch partner manager who he requested to be replaced because he "didn't do anything for me... he was never on my channel, he didn't follow me on Twitter, he wouldn't even inform us about Twitch Rivals tournaments." Beahm continued, "Just a few months later, that ex-Twitch partner manager is directly involved in getting me banned. Coincidence? The Twitch user [involved in the case] tells [them] they do not want to report anything to Twitch but this ex Twitch partner manager encourages the user and even directs them to file a report directly with Twitch, even though the user told them clearly that we never physically met anywhere and that no photographs were exchanged." Beahm does not explain why the former partner manager believed potentially inappropriate behaviour had occurred in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
"I'll say it again," Beahm continued. "Neither I nor the Twitch user exchanged any sexually graphic messages or images... I even used the word 'inappropriate' purposely, and look how it was defined by everyone, including these defaming articles. I'm sorry but mutual bantering with inappropriate jokes taken out of context should have never led to me getting banned from Twitch."
</p>
<p>
Beahm then offered a lengthy explanation of how the report was progressed - wrongly he claims - first to Twitch's law enforcement response team, and then to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. "As far as I know," he added, "they didn't escalate Twitch's report to law enforcement. Mind you, the same people that made this decision [at Twitch] admitted internally that the messages did not constitute sexting... that the messages did not warrant any child sexual abuse material charge... Twitch makes this decision to terminate my contract and ban me while admitting they never investigated the age of consent in the jurisdiction where the user's messages were sent and received."
</p>
<p>
"I don't claim to be perfect," Beahm added toward the end of his statement, "but I also didn't do all the shit that they're saying I did. But then that doesn't make a story, right? They wanted media attention, the media wants controversy, and by sensationalising all this with big inaccurate headlines like 'sexting' and 'sexually explicit', you all got what you wanted at the expense of [me]. The reality is they wanted to cut down the Doc, plain and simple.... It's so obvious that certain Twitch executives and employees involved had personal biases against the Doc and used all of these as an opportunity to terminate my contract."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not denying the exchange of Whispers," Beahm concluded. "I'm not denying that to all of you out there. It looks bad. I have no way of knowing if the Twitch user thought our exchange of Whispers was inappropriate. If it was, I apologise. All I know is that I never did what Twitch, Cody Conners, or the public is claiming that I did."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-youtube-twitch-drlupo-timthetatman-swagg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember a few years ago when YouTube started <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/10/twitch-youtube-drlupo-timthetatman-leave-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aggressively throwing money</a> at some of Twitch’s golden-egg-laying-est geese, leading to widespread speculation that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/14/youtube-strategy-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube might supplant Twitch</a> as the internet’s premiere livestreaming destination? That… didn’t happen. This week saw three big-name streamers – Ben “Dr Lupo” Lupo, Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar, and Kris "Swagg" Lamberson – <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/swagg-timthetatman-drlupo-come-back-twitch-multistreaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return to Twitch</a> after their lucrative YouTube exclusivity contracts expired. From here on out, the former two will stream on both Twitch and YouTube, while the latter is focusing on Twitch. The more things change, the more they stay the same. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin by marveling at the speed with which <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony pulled the plug on its latest live service offering</a>, <em>Concord</em>, a game so focused-grouped for everyone that it ended up being for no one. Are live service games as a whole doomed? Probably not. But the way triple-A publishers approach them – toiling away for years and then releasing something that feels dated on day one – likely is.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we reflect on the great Twitch vs YouTube livestreaming war, which seems to be ending with a whimper rather than a bang. Now that Twitch allows creators to stream to multiple platforms and YouTube seems uninterested in significantly improving its streaming product, why not? In the end, nobody really won The Streaming Wars. Instead, they got distracted trying to copy TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NaNoWriMo’s weird stance on AI</a>, which – as with most supposed defenses of AI as a creative tool – just doesn’t really make much sense. Oh, and I absolutely knock it out of the park with my segment transitions this week. Do not believe anyone who tells you otherwise!</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can sink millions into doomed live service <em>and </em>platform exclusivity efforts (or at least into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying ourselves sustainable salaries</a>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>[These streamers] are now streaming to Twitch and YouTube, which has become the new meta ever since Twitch started letting people do it last year. So we’re in this place where a few years ago, all the headlines were about the exclusivity wars between Twitch and YouTube. They were trying to lock down all the biggest names, and YouTube was making these big moves to try to become the new destination for livestreaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Here we are a few years later, and both have abandoned that strategy. YouTube really isn’t offering contracts like that to streamers anymore. Twitch still kind of does it in places, but not really. It’s interesting to see how things have changed, in part because the landscape shifted and now everyone’s on every platform. Even we’re doing that, to an extent. You post everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Technically you’ve been able to do that forever. You can stream to two different [platforms]. That’s not hard. It’s a very easy thing to do. The only thing preventing people was the money – and also moderating two different platforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s the big issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, if you have two chats, that sucks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>There have been debates this week between streamers about what to do now. Is the best approach to multi-stream because you’re allowed to and because you can maximize your audience’s size that way? Or is the strategy to focus on one streaming platform, because even beyond moderation, there’s also the issue of just engaging with an audience. It’s really hard to follow two chats at once. So if you want to engage with people – which is the point of livestreaming; the reason why it’s so popular is because there’s a back and forth – it doesn’t make sense to try to reach multiple audiences at once. Because at the end of the day, your YouTube audience or your Twitch audience or your Kick audience or whatever will have trouble talking to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I hope people aren’t prioritizing their Kick audiences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, but I had to include that because Kick does have a sizable audience for livestreaming at this point. I’d be remiss if I didn’t. But yeah, there are some people who say “Yeah, I’ve gotta be everywhere.” Ludwig, who’s one of the big remaining YouTube streamers, said that the next Kai Cenat isn’t going to come from multi-streaming. The next one of those is gonna be locked into a particular audience and culture. I don’t really have a take on this; I think that we’re going to have to wait and see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>People are talking about how there are tools you can use to unify chat display. Not surprising. It still sucks to do, I think. I think that’s annoying. There’s a company called Topping that makes an audience interface. It’s a very funny name for a company. They just got into audio interfaces, and they have one out called the OTG model. You can plug a phone into it and plug it into a computer and have the same mic audio going into a livestream on a phone and your computer.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re doing the shit we’re talking about where you have a TikTok livestream and another stream going into Twitch, you can do both of those and have the audio feed into both. That’s one of those things where you’re like “Who is this for?” And then you hear people doing this meta with multiple streams, and you’re like “That’s who it’s for.” People who want to stream to, like, five different platforms.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s still weird because the appeal of a chat is often the relationships within that chat. Even if you can address multiple groups, I think it still feels disjointed from a viewer perspective. Even if you see both chats at once via software, they’re not talking to each other. So you still end up in this odd spot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I just want to make fun of the URL [for the company Chris mentioned], which is topping.pro, which I would click, but I would not expect to get what I’m told I’ll be getting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This is like every time I see a commercial for Dick’s Sporting Goods, and they tell me to visit dicks.com. I’m like “I don’t believe you! I don’t believe I’m going to get what you say I’m going to get from this website!”</p><p>But anyway, back to the topic at hand, I think it’s interesting where all of this has gone. For a minute there, it seemed like YouTube really cared about streamers and wanted to make that a big part of its offering. They had this guy named Ryan Wyatt who was running that side of things, and he was very hands-on, talking with streamers on Twitter all the time. Actually, I wouldn’t be surprised if what Dan Clancy, the current CEO of Twitch, is doing was inspired by Ryan being the head of a division but also this big-time community guy who was always making appearances, and everyone knew him by name. Being everyone’s cool friend.&nbsp;</p><p>But then what happened is, YouTube discovered something that Twitch has kind of known all along: Streaming is not an easy way for companies to make money. And around the same time, shorts got big. TikTok blew up. YouTube was trying to become a major player in the streaming space in 2020 and 2021, which is right around the time that TikTok really caught on. So YouTube was like “We’ve gotta pivot to rip that off.” In the years that followed, streaming just kind of stalled out for them.</p><p>They encountered the same problem that Twitch has in another way: Discoverability isn’t great on YouTube if all you’re doing is streaming. So streamers who weren’t already huge struggled there. And now we’re sort of back at square one, where streaming is a thing YouTube doesn’t seem to care about that much and Twitch is the main place to go for it. All these millions of dollars were slung around at streamers in the name of winning a war between two tech giants, and the end result is a status quo that’s not that different from what came before.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mister-pi-de-10-nano-clone-board-taki-udon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Of all the consoles I have ever bought, few rival the sheer usefulness of my MiSTer. Based on a Terasic DE-10 Nano development board, the open source project encompasses a massive amount of consoles, old computers, and arcade machines with pinpoint accuracy. New additions happen every day thanks to the community of developers. I was lucky: I bought my DE-10 Nano board before the massive jump in prices a few years back, which has been the biggest barrier for new people attempting to gain entry to this community. All that may have just changed, thanks to a replacement clone board produced by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TakiUdon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taki Udon</a>. And he’s not stopping there–he’s hoping to upend the entire MiSTer ecosystem.</p><p>I first became aware of Taki Udon while looking up reviews of retro handhelds on YouTube.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TakiUdon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> His channel,</a> with 369k subscribers as of this writing, often focuses on the inexpensive but powerful emulation handhelds from companies like Anbernic. There are countless devices like this with names like R35S, TRIMUI Smart Pro, or Miyoo Mini Pro. Most of them run some variant of Linux and are between $30-$100, which buys you a shocking amount of device.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="We Need to Talk." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnDSBbzYE5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I became aware of Taki Udon first via his YouTube channel, where he publishes videos on retro handhelds like this.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Taki himself never appears on camera. All you see are his hands, usually in front of a single color sheet of seamless paper peppered with retro devices and narrated by his enthusiastic, cheerful voice. He does not talk about his personal life or experience explicitly (he says he wishes to open up in a video series later), but he says he is in the business of hardware development in China.&nbsp;</p><p>“I never liked that MiSTer was tied to a platform that was out of reach for many people,” Taki told me over Discord “For a few years, I wanted to do something with FPGA, but there was never a good opportunity. Late last year, I started having discussions about whether or not it would be possible to create a successor platform for developers to migrate to with more performance at a lower price. I reached out to members of the community to get some feedback on what kind of hardware features they would want in an upgraded dev board.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MiSTER Pi - Product Overview &amp; New User Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbppuWmukw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A product overview of the MiSTER Pi board.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“While that was happening, we started to work on creating a board that could run MiSTer as-is to get some experience making a board,” Taki told me. “When that board was done, we felt confident that we could make a similar board with an upgraded FPGA, but I thought it would not further our goal of trying to get more people into FPGA gaming if we did not offer up the R&amp;D board that we had. We would have also fragmented the community because there are a lot of people who still want to enjoy the systems that are supported by the current Cyclone V. So we paused work on making the successor platform and turned our focus to building out a cost-effective roadmap based on CV5.”</p><p>When Taki announced that he was not only creating a more affordable MiSTer clone board, but several commercial consoles and handhelds, I was taken aback. Announcing that many products is surprising to say the least. But his background, coupled with his <a href="https://x.com/takiudon_/status/1830814512959689157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close proximity</a> to hardware production in China, goes a long way to explaining how that might happen.</p><figure><figcaption>Laying it all out. Credit: Taki Udon</figcaption></figure><p>“Yeah, I live in China. I worked in consumer electronics for several years before forming my new company,” Taki said. “When it comes to prototyping, there are a lot of things that are easier to do here. There is no shortage of PCB companies that you can work with, and it is fast and cheap to get boards made by some of the companies that you mentioned. Those companies already have great pricing on their global websites, but they charge way less on the domestic platform.”</p><figure><figcaption>So far all that Taki has posted aside of the rest of the line is this brief tease of the handhelds and some early close-ups of the consoles. Credit: <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1826602501044666743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taki Udon</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last few months, Taki has been teasing out a drip feed of hints and images, asking for design feedback from the community with the product line growing more and more ambitious. His account is one of the few I have notifications turned on for, and usually updates late at night. As of this writing, multiple products have been announced: “Flagship, mainstream, budget cartridge, and two handhelds,” Taki told me.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Full Stack. Credit: Taki Udon</figcaption></figure><p>“After I decided that I wanted to sell the bare $99 board, I sat down and decided to try and come up with a product roadmap that would reuse the work that we had already done. I took a full day to draw 2D ID for three consoles and a single handheld. I'd have to look at timestamps, but I remember it taking 14 hours or so. The next day, I had a meeting with my cofounder, and I pitched all four products to see which ones would get greenlit. Needless to say, they all got approved. Those three consoles turned into four during the rest of the ID stage, and the single handheld split into two.</p><p>“For this project, we did some rapid prototyping on accessory boards using those services. It's awesome to be able to get a board file, modify some of the routing, and have the order fully processed and shipped to your house in 48 hours.”</p><p>While Taki Udon has been announcing his product roadmap, at least two other <a href="https://x.com/zyjnumber1/status/1791769986396307930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyclone-V based DE-10 Nano</a> clone boards have emerged on the market, one of which has integrated RAM, by a company called QMTech. Both have been <a href="https://irkenlabs.com/qmtech-de10-clone-mini-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fosp0mnU8X0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple people</a>, and seem to work in that setup. They are not without their limitations and quirks, particularly when it comes to compatibility with the existing ecosystem of MiSTer cases and I/O boards, <a href="https://x.com/zyjnumber1/status/1829442478426169724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although QMTech sells their own hats</a>. But that makes Taki Udon’s board and ecosystem of multiple potential consoles all the more interesting, and more competition within this space only further loosens the bottleneck that Terasic has imposed on an otherwise open source project.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Switch Lite OLED - Engineering Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufYiLnbOkbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>On top of all this, Taki is also doing a Switch Lite OLED.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Taki does not seem worried. “The community is still kind of small compared to other things that I have worked on, but I think there are a lot of people who are excited about this little niche growing with cheaper products. That motivates me to want to work harder on this. In terms of things being harder than I expected, I wouldn't say anything was really that difficult for the product that will launch this month. Everything has been pretty smooth, all things considered, but that's mostly because we aren't solving any difficult technical challenges to make this product.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We are also working on a Switch Lite OLED screen, and that is orders of magnitude more complex from a product standpoint than making the triple stack at a cheaper price. The most difficult thing that we have in this FPGA roadmap is the flagship console. That has a lot of technical challenges that need to be dealt with to get it out the door.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Taki Udon's Clone MiSTer FPGA Review Part 2!

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adbf93e5f3781335c25911eccce26e64" data-recommend-id="image://adbf93e5f3781335c25911eccce26e64" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Space Marine Titus holding back a large wave of aliens.

Literally or metaphorically, from <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em>/<em>SaGa</em> and <em>Star Ocean</em> to <em>Xenogears </em>and even some <em>Final Fantasies</em>, a foundational narrative in which our heroes push back against a cruel, manipulative creator is like a spinal cord holding up many a juggernaut of Japanese RPG canon. But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power. No, not <em>Dragon Quest</em>; yes, you visit churches to save in those games, but then you go and hang out in pubs and gamble like an exhausted salaryman.

Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 contain these hidden locations and even contain their own hoops to jump through in order to access and complete them. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/How_to_Unlock_the_Chapter_2_Secret_Area">Accessing the Chapter 2 secret area</a> alone requires the completion of a separate quest for a warthog NPC, and it comes with two bosses to beat – the Tiger Vanguard and Fuban. While keeping every location and its requirements in mind, players will also need to ensure they complete the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Side_Questlines">Treasure Hunter side quest in Chapter 3</a> and beat the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Boss_List_and_Guides">game’s final boss, The Great Sage’s Broken Shell</a>. Make sure you don’t start a New Cycle afterward, though, as there is still more to do.</p><p>After choosing to continue your journey, you’ll need to find Mount Mei, with arguably the most difficult boss in the game, Erlang, the Sacred Divinity, waiting to greet anyone who’s made it this far. Finally, after beating Erlang and the Four Heavenly Kings that follow him, you’ll need to beat The Great Sage’s Broken Shell just one more time. Then, after what is sure to result in hours of work, you’ll be rewarded with the Black Myth: Wukong true secret ending, which includes a gorgeously animated video.</p><p>It's… a lot! Thankfully, if you’re pressed for time or just can’t get past that Erlang fight, we’ve recorded and shared the full clip below.

It's not a new edition or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deleted-fantasy-flight-games-custom-tools-files-restored-by-fans" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly uncovered custom scenarios</a>, but a set of ship cards from a canceled ship pack. And it is available to everyone for free.</p>

<p>According to a social media <a href="https://x.com/atomicmassgames/status/1832106250911494539">post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Atomic Mass Games decided to release cards for the announced, then canceled, <em>Star Wars X-Wing TIE Phantom </em>and<em> Alpha Class Starwing</em> ship packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-x-wing-cancelled-alpha-starship-pilot-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8t8riSaG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-x-wing-cancelled-alpha-starship-pilot-card-artwork.jpg?itok=5arTEUV5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The cards are available on Atomic Mass Games' <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-docs/">website</a> as a print-and-play PDF. In addition, the game's points document has been updated to include the new ships.</p>
<p>Like all <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> ship packs, the cards in <em>TIE Phantom</em> and <em>Alpha Class Starwing </em>contain a mix of tactics, weapons, pilot cards, and spaceship artwork courtesy of Timothy Ben Zweifel, Matt Bradbury, Mark Molnar, and Anthony Deville.</p>
<p>This is the first piece of new content for <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> since April 2022. The original game was released in 2012 by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2018, the game received <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a second edition</a>.</p>
<p>Since its release, the game has had 12 waves of expansions. These expansions have added multiple ships and factions from across the Star Wars franchise, including the CIS and Old Republic from the prequel trilogy and the New Republic and First Order from the sequel trilogy.</p>

These include <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-early-2021-expansions-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars Legion</em></a>, and <em>Star Wars Armada</em>. This past June, Atomic Mass Games announced they were <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/update-on-star-wars-x-wing-and-star-wars-armada/">stopping development</a> on both <em>X-Wing</em> and <em>Armada</em>.</p>
<p>Atomic Mass Games has stopped all active development on both miniature games but continues to support the community through tournaments and organized play events.</p>
<p>If you want some new content in your <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> skirmishes, these print-and-play ship cards may do the trick. As for miniature models, there's always the option of DIY 3D printing.</p>
