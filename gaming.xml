                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>

            <p>
Three former senior Ubisoft employees - including one-time chief creative officer and second-in-command Serge Hascoet - have received suspended prison sentences and fines from a French court after being found guilty of harassment prior to their departure five years ago.
</p>
<p>
Hascoet - along with Ubisoft's former editorial boss Tommy François and game director Guillaume Patrux - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ubisoft-execs-stand-trial-in-france-accused-of-harassment">appeared in a French court earlier this year</a>, accused of psychological and sexual harassment during their time at the company. All three left Ubisoft in 2020, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">wave of resignations and dismissals</a> among senior employees and executives, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">serious allegations of sexual misconduct become public</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">reported by the Guardian</a>, Francois has now received a three-year suspended prison sentence and a €30,000 fine after being found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment, and an attempted sexual assault. During the trial, it was alleged Francois had restrained a female employee while trying to kiss her on the mouth. He was also accused of forcing a female co-worker to do handstands while she wore a skirt, alongside other incidents.
</p>
<p>
Hascoët - who faced accusations of racist comments and other behaviour during the trial - was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment by the court, receiving an eight-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000. Patrux has been handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000 after being convicted of psychological harassment. During the trial, it was alleged Patrux had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, and set fire to a colleague's beard with a cigarette lighter, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">asked how much he knew of the issues taking place in his company</a> prior to the sexual misconduct allegations becoming public, Ubisoft CEO and co-founder Yves Guillemot said, "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will" in a carefully worded statement. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he added.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-technical-analysis-of-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-technical-analysis-of-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2.1234254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 2 arrived with a bunch of titles that had to perform well if they were going to be worth your time. Arguably, none were more in need of a silky smooth frame rate than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, which had to be top notch if it was ever going to appeal to the fighting fans.</p>
<p>We had a blast with the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> last month, with the performance in all modes (apart from World Tour) being a particular highlight. But for those who want the specific numbers, the experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6KBxxvdXo">Digital Foundry</a> have finally joined the fight to give a detailed rundown of all the tech specs in Capcom's latest.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with image quality, DF's Thomas Morgan states that the Switch 2 version "punches well above its weight". The Switch 2 puts up <strong>960x540p</strong> resolution in docked mode, with the DLSS upscaler boosting things to <strong>1080p</strong>. The analysis notes that you may encounter some flickers here and there, but it's a "win on balance" in the grand scheme of things, and even appears crisper than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Naturally, the image quality pales in comparison to the PS5's 4K offering, but the textures are a notable upgrade from the Series S and fall closer in line to what you'd find on the PS4.</p>
<p>Some settings are missing on Switch 2 — the depth of field effect, 'Crowded' background NPCs, no movement for physics-based particles — though DF emphasises that these are "never game-breaking".</p>
<p>The portable mode opts for a <strong>640x360p</strong> resolution, with DLSS reconstructing it up to <strong>720p</strong>, and lighting and shadows take a big hit because of it, winding up closer to the base PS4 edition. There's a docked/handheld comparison in the above video around the 8:20 mark that's well worth a look if you want to see the changes in action.</p>
<p>The World Tour modes are deemed "less polished in their visual delivery overall," with regular NPC pop-ins and reduced frame rates for characters at range. That said, DF is quick to point out that Switch 2 is "not alone in presenting these problems, rather, it inherits them from the other console releases".</p>
<p>In terms of frame rate, things are locked at a "perfect" <strong>60fps</strong> in both docked and handheld in the fighting rounds, but they do drop to around 45fps in the pre-fight hype sequences — not that it affects the game at all. The World Tour mode, as expected, is not as smooth, with the unlocked frame rate reaching anywhere from <strong>30-60fps</strong>, and getting capped at 30 in the side-on battles.</p>
<p>All in all, then, it sounds like a generally strong technical experience on Switch 2. You can see all of this analysis in action in the above Digital Foundry video, but for our thoughts on the game, you'll find our full review below.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The current custodians of the World of Darkness tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> universe are bang up for doing more video game adaptations like the troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, according to White Wolf brand marketing manager Jason Carl. In fact, they may be working on a few already, with Carl naming Mage: The Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming and the Dark Ages setting as deserving of "the Bloodlines treatment".</p>
<p>People who've been keeping up with the vamps and their video game misadventures may find that last phrase a bit rich. For clarity, I assume that by "Bloodlines treatment" Carl means "we're going to make a big 3D RPG with a lot of lore". Rather than "we're going to delay it so often it becomes a running joke, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">fire the original narrative director</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">hand it to a different studio</a> with no real track record for RPGs, then tell people it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more spiritual successor than sequel</a>". </p><!--more-->
<p>White Wolf are the official licensing and publishing entity for all World Of Darkness adaptations. They were acquired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> outfit Paradox Interactive in October 2015, and are now co-publishers for Bloodlines 2. As for the World of Darkness itself, this is a sprawling modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> fiction analogous to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which encompasses several apocalypses and several table-top RPGs.</p>
<p>While the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> is by far the most famous World Of Darkness video game adaptation, there are plenty more out there - 2003 hack-and-slash Hunter: The Reckoning and, much more recently, a bunch of Werewolf games, plus some mobile projects. In a new interview with PCGamesN, Carl made no bones of White Wolf's desire to keep cranking out the spin-offs.</p>
<p>"Who says we're not already?" he joked in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/world-of-darkness-games">PCGamesN</a>. "The answer is yes. All of those supernatural creatures have their own stories to tell, and many of them are just waiting their turn and for the right story to come along.</p>
<p>"It's not just Hunter and Werewolf," Carl went on. "It's no secret that, when we set up our in-house publishing business, we've been exploring many of the other World of Darkness games that people have been waiting for and that are underdeveloped. We've got our eyes on Mage, we've got our eyes on The Dark Ages, we've got our eyes on Changeling; we're spending a lot of time thinking about these three, and other games that people have been waiting for."</p>
<p>Carl is himself a former tabletop RPG game designer, having started out at D&amp;D creators Wizards of the Coast in the 1990s. In the chat with PCGN, he was especially enthusiastic about adapting Mage, a tabletop game that first released in 1993 and is, as you may guess, all about sorcery.</p>
<p>"I have spent considerable time thinking about what Mage would look like in a new edition," he said. "The world we live in today is very different from what we imagined it would look like when the White Wolf team were building those previous editions of Mage, and I think we're all looking forward to the challenges of figuring out how Prime and Paradox work in this world, as opposed to the world we thought we were going to get."</p>
<p>I'm not that familiar with Mage, but I gather from the White Wolf wikis that <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)">Prime</a> is one of the nine spheres of magic - it "governs the raw energy of reality". While <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_(MTAs)">Paradox</a> "is the collective force of consensual reality fighting back against the enlightened will of the mage."</p>
<p>This certainly seems adventurous, for a magic system, in that I can't quite picture how you'd translate all that into an everyday fireball spell. How am I supposed to splat cellar rats with *checks notes* an "Odyllic Force"? My goodness, could this be an arcane institution with <em>implications for things beside combat and levelling up</em>? I am pleased by the prospect of a video game based on such wild notions. Almost as much as I am sceptical of White Wolf's big promises, given their and Paradox's handling of the "spiritual successor" to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.</p>
<p>"There's no obstacle or gatekeeping function that would prevent any of these from making it out into a videogame and getting the Bloodlines treatment," Carl concluded. "It's a question of time, resources, the right development partners, and story." I don't know, Carl. The first three of those seem like pretty significant obstacles. They seem like much the same obstacles Bloodlines 2 has been smashing its pointy chops against since 2019, in fact. Maybe at least ship your new Vampire game - due in October, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">a recent round of layoffs at developers Chinese Room</a> - before you make any bets on the rest of the World of Darkness.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-world-of-darkness-rpgs-deserve-the-bloodlines-treatment-say-white-wolf-especially-mage-the-ascension]]></content:encoded>

The game looked great, with gorgeous visuals, a slick art style, and gameplay that seemed like a combination of <em>Deus Ex, Dying Light,</em> and the old <em>Perfect Dark</em> games. However, the gameplay trailer didn’t include a release date. And now it seems this cool-looking reboot won’t ever see the light of day. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531]]></content:encoded>

To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</blockquote><blockquote>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</blockquote><blockquote>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community.

I do think the work that Double Fine’s doing and how Tim [Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team. And the other one, I’ll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they’re making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer said Microsoft had been able to give the developers of those games (State of Decay, the next game from Double Fine, and Everwild) time while still having a packed schedule of releases (bolstered, obviously, by the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can give those teams time,” Spencer said. “And next week I’m going to be up in Vancouver with the Coalition [Gears of War developer] — and how fun is that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everwild had faced concern amid reboot reports and the exit of creative director Simon Woodroffe in 2020. Rare filled the director's chair with veteran designer Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pinata, and Sea of Thieves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was Everwilds? Reports indicated it was a third-person adventure game with god game elements, but given how long it was in development, that may have changed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three former Ubisoft executives have been given suspended prison sentences in a harassment trial that began in March and was delayed until June. </p>



<p>First reported by French publication <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/07/02/harcelement-chez-ubisoft-trois-anciens-cadres-condamnes-a-des-peines-allant-jusqu-a-trois-ans-de-prison-avec-sursis_6617387_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>, former vice president of editorial and creative services, Thomas François, was found guilty of moral and sexual harassment and attempted sexual assault. He was fined €30,000 and given a three-year suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Former chief creative officer at Ubisoft, Serge Hascoët, was accused of making lewd and racist comments and of allegedly harassing a Muslim employee by replacing her desktop background with images of food and placing food on her desk while she was fasting for Ramadan. He was fined €45,000 and received an 18-month suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Lastly, former game designer at Ubisoft, Guillame Patrux, was accused of psychological harassment and given a 12-month suspended prison sentence and a €10,000 fine. </p>



<p>Patrux, Hascoët, and François, were all part of the toxic culture Ubisoft had allowed to fester that employees called out in 2021 with an open letter from employees calling for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-workers-support-activision-blizzard-employees/">A Better Ubisoft</a>. While Activision Blizzard employees were calling out the leaders who perpetuated ABK's own toxic culture, Ubisoft employees stood up to support workers at Activision Blizzard King, while also calling out their own studios issues. </p>



<p>A year later, Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-a-better-ubisoft-worker-demands-not-met-25-percent-quit/">called out chief executive officer Yves Guillemot</a> for seemingly not responding to the demands staff had made to improve the company culture, while claiming that he took the issues they had raised<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-acknowledges-employees-letter-promises-new-update-in-q3-employees-claim-their-demands-were-sidelined/"> "<em>seriously</em>."</a></p>



<p>One of the key issues employees raised was that when issues with executives like Hascoët were brought forward, rather than that executive losing their job, they were transferred to another position in Ubisoft's global team. It's worth noting that Hascoët was never officially fired from the company, and instead resigned, reportedly after a conversation was had regarding the allegations against him.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youll-soon-be-able-to-buy-dlc-in-installments-because-of-course.1234194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In another sign that the industry is doing very well and everything is going completely fine, it'll soon be possible to pay for certain in-game DLC purchases in installments rather than in one lump sum.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-you-can-buy-in-game-dlc-and-pay-it-off-later/1100-6532906/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamespot</a>, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Affirm has teamed up with commerce outfit Xsolla in order to allow players to "pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more on payment plans" (that's Gamespot's wording).</p>

<p>Essentially, you'll see Affirm as another payment option when you make a DLC purchase of this magnitude. You'll then be subject to a credit check, and if you pass that check, you'll be able to buy your DLC across several installments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dlc-installments-fortnite-squid-game.jpg?itok=lRQfhS-f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dlc-installments-fortnite-squid-game.jpg?itok=tziZE49C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>could be one of the first games to allow paying for DLC in installments.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know which games this service will be appearing in. Xsolla works with lots of studios and publishers, but it hasn't announced which companies have signed up for the Xsolla-Affirm partnership.</p>

<p>However, as Gamespot points out, Epic Games has been confirmed as a partner for the studios, which means we could start seeing BNPL-based DLC purchases in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>before long.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what kind of ungodly&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skin could cost that much, you might be overlooking in-game currency; a bundle of 13,500 V-Bucks will <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop/v-bucks?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set you back $90</a>, so hey, why wouldn't you want to pay that back piece by piece?</p>

<p>This deal comes at a time when many of the most popular games around right now are free-to-play (<a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/buy-gta-v-shark-cash-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and paid</a>!) titles <a href="https://store.ea.com/apex-legends/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complete</a> with in-game purchases, and many of those can run $50 or more, so it's easy to see why this decision has been made.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-dlc-installments.jpg?itok=wEA6LQ0Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-dlc-installments.jpg?itok=a93Lseoq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paying for expensive&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>currency bundles might get "easier" in future.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's hard not to see this as an indictment of an industry that appears to be getting greedier with players' wallets; perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I'm just not sure $50 and upwards in DLC or microtransaction purchases can be healthy, unless it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">substantial expansion</a> (and even then, you're unlikely to pay that much).</p>

<p>It's worth noting here that no game has adopted this system yet, and that it might be a while until we see it crop up as part of in-game stores. Still, that's almost certainly on the cards for the future. Yay!</p>

            <p>Microsoft have reportedly cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at ZeniMax Online Studios, developers of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a>, as part of the company's wider layoffs.</p>
<p>This is according to a post from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which follows separate reports that the layoffs have seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>. It very much looks like a pool of canned projects are accumulating at MS's feet as part of these cuts, though the company are still yet to confirm anything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG was codenamed "Blackbird" and had been in development since 2018, according to Schreier. It would have been the second game ZOS has been principal developer of since their founding in 2007, the first being Elder Scrolls Online, which has received regular updates and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">expansions</a> in the decade and change since release.</p>
<p>While we've not seen or heard much about Blackbird over the years, ZeniMax Online Studios posted job applications seeking people to work on a new engine for a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-boss-says-his-devs-have-been-killing-it-confirms-the-studio-is-working-on-a-new-game-with-a-new-engine/">around 2019</a>.</p>
<p>"We've learned a lot bringing the world of The Elder Scrolls to life, and it's time for us to take those lessons and build a new AAA IP," reads a <a href="https://www.zenimaxonline.com/joinus">careers page on ZOS' website</a>. "The vision for our next game is grand in every sense of the word, and that's why we're developing a new engine to support the needs of the project and studio. Because we're in early pre-production, this is the perfect time to join us and make your mark on an incredible new project."</p>
<p>If the reports are legit, it's sad we'll never get to see what Blackbird could have evolved into. I've never really gotten that into ESO despite loving an old roll of paper, simply because I prefer Elder Scrolls as a single player game. But much like its brother from another mother <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, ESO has certainly stuck around for the long haul, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-wasnt-the-biggest-threat-to-the-elder-scrolls-online-it-was-skyrim">evolving a lot over the years</a> and establishing a loyal audience.</p>
<p>As much as the reported game cancellation sucks, though, it's obviously the people being impacted by these layoffs that really matter. "As one illustration of just how sloppy and chaotic today's mass Xbox layoff has been," Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsykj2ccls22">follow-up post</a>, "some employees at Zenimax Online Studios are now watching their Slack accounts abruptly get locked out. No message from HR, no word on whether they still have a job, just an ominous Slack deactivation."</p>
<p>Christ.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

The latest furore is likely a momentary blip until developer NetEase fully unveils all the cosmetics releasing in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ third season, but as some of the skins leak out ahead of their announcement, Spider-Man fans are angry about the absence of one of the web slinger’s most iconic looks: the Symbiote Suit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196032" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="270" data-playlist="196032,195896,195358" data-current="196032"><div><p>Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21556.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Even if you’re not paying attention, you’ve probably seen the Symbiote Suit at least a few times since its debut in the comics in the ‘80s. The black-and-white outfit is arguably Peter Parker’s most iconic alternate suit when he’s not wearing his trademark blue-and-red onesie. As the name implies, the look is the result of a symbiotic, goo-like alien lifeform taking over the hero, causing an internal struggle between Peter and the creature’s violent tendencies. Spider-Man’s black-and-white look has appeared in several adaptations, including video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271">2023’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a></span>, and 2007’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><em>Spider-Man 3</em> film starring Tobey Maguire</a></span>. It would make a natural addition to <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, one fans are clamoring for, and it would probably sell like hot cakes, but NetEase has yet to announce it. What makes the current situation all the more peculiar is that some of the skins in the game’s upcoming battle pass that <em>have</em> leaked include Symbiote skins for several other characters who are not your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.</p><p>Based on the leaked art posted on X (formerly Twitter) account Rivals_Leaks, we now know that Squirrel Girl, Rocket Raccoon, and Jeff the Land Shark will all be getting Symbiote skins as part of the battle pass. Those might read like gag picks, but they have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_War:_It%27s_Jeff_Vol_1_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_War:_It%27s_Jeff_Vol_1_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some basis in the comics</a></span>, each at some point <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon_(Earth-18197)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon_(Earth-18197)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being overtaken by a Symbiote</a></span>. With the alien goop suit being an obvious theme this season, it’s only a matter of time before we see Spidey don the fit, right? <em>Right?</em> Possibly! Until we know for sure, however, Spider-Man fans are gonna crash out and/or vibrate with anticipation, if that’s okay with y’all.</p><p>Given how popular the suit is, it wouldn’t surprise me if <em>Marvel Rivals </em>made it a shop skin instead of putting it on the battle pass. That way, people can buy it outright for about twice as much cash. If, somehow, NetEase doesn’t add this skin during the Symbiote-themed Season 3, beginning July 11, I expect the internet to melt. I mean, hey, Spidey’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1939791055991242879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1939791055991242879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already getting a new skin bundle this week</a></span>, so it’s entirely possible NetEase pushes it further down the pipeline so Peter doesn’t get too greedy.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-symbiote-spider-man-rocket-jeff-1851785527]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rare appears to have become caught up in Microsoft's round of layoffs today, and the developer's long-running project&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>also seems to have been canceled, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>,&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which hasn't been heard from in some time (barring a somewhat vague update from Xbox boss Phil Spencer earlier this year), has been shut down. Additionally, employees at Rare are "likely to lose their jobs" (that's VGC's wording, but the publication is citing "people with knowledge of the project").</p>

<p>It's all part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive round of layoffs</a> at Microsoft that began earlier today, with&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush&nbsp;</em>studio King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax already affected by job cuts. Other studios, like Rare, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">widely expected</a> to enter Microsoft's crosshairs as part of these cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/everwild-xbox-layoffs-rare.jpg?itok=buQfwUTQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/everwild-xbox-layoffs-rare.jpg?itok=lFkBDB39 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, according to "people familiar with the project".</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>is almost certainly one of the victims of this layoff wave, which could see upwards of 9,000 employees losing their jobs, it hasn't been without its own troubles in the past as well.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare" rel="nofollow">announced all the way back in 2019</a>&nbsp;with a rather evocative trailer, albeit one that didn't show too much in the way of concrete gameplay.</p>

<p>That would turn out to be a consistent theme with&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>; another trailer was shown <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-trailer-shown-at-xbox-games-event" rel="nofollow">during the Xbox event in July 2020</a>, and while it was certainly visually striking, it once again failed to show exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would be.</p>

<p>Between then and now, Xbox didn't say much about&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>at all, but rumors swirled that the game's development had essentially been rebooted, suggesting that Rare and Xbox weren't entirely sure in which direction they wanted to take their latest project.</p>




<p>It's hard to say whether&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would have been granted more of a reprieve were these layoffs not being put into effect. Its lengthy, seemingly troubled development gives the impression of a game that nobody was quite sure about, so it may well have ended up falling by the wayside anyway.</p>

<p>In any case, with&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>now dead, Rare doesn't have another publicly-announced project in the works. Xbox doesn't seem to be shuttering the studio (for now, at least; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">certainly past form in this area</a>), so we'll just have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

Unfortunately, also like other free-to-play games, it’s a little unclear what each currency does.

And where can you get them? Here’s what you need to know about using the Proelium in your inventory.</p><h2 id="h792544"><a id=""></a>What is Proelium used for?</h2><p>Proelium is used to purchase additional variants and upgrades for cosmetic skins for both the player and weapons. These purchases can be either variants of a given skin, or additional upgrades that give new effects. At the moment, these seem to be mostly limited to skins of Mythic rarity, with some exceptions at lower rarities. You can see if a skin has variants or upgrades on the purchase screen for the cosmetic, or by going to the edit screen for a skin you already own.</p><h2 id="h792545"><a id=""></a>How do you use Proelium?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-recommend-id="image://aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a gun skin in a shop.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After purchasing a Mythic weapon or character cosmetic, right click or press Y/triangle while selecting it in your loadout menu. Once in here, you’ll be able to see the variants and upgrades you can purchase.</p><p>The best example is a cosmetic from the open beta, the Deadly Harvest Jackhammer skin. Once you purchase this, you also will gain access to three additional variants of the skin, which you can unlock for 10 Proelium each. These don’t change the skin drastically, but give it some new colors as a way to further your own expression–and flex that you spent money to get the Mythic skin.</p><p>In addition to variants, you can get upgrades that heighten the cool factor of your new cosmetic for 20 Proelium each. For instance, with the Jackhammer skin, you can get a new tracer for your gun that gives a unique look and sound to every bullet fired, and a death effect that makes your target vanish when they’re defeated.</p><p>Luckily, getting Proelium is the simplest part about the currency! There are two main ways: directly converting Splitcoin into it, or earning it through a battle pass. The Beta Pass offered 70 Proelium for players to earn, for example, though it’s unclear if this will be the case for future ones as well.</p><p>As for the Splitcoin conversion, you can select one of three options:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>40 Proelium for 1,000 Splitcoin</li><li>100 Proelium for 2,000 Splitcoin</li><li>240 Proelium for 4,000 Splitcoin</li></ul><p>With those rates, if you haven’t exhausted the option yet, you’re better off buying the premium battle pass to get Proelium. And even if you have, you are probably better off waiting for the next battle pass and seeing how much Proelium you can get from it.</p><p><em>Splitgate 2 </em>is currently available on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-proelium-uses-worth-it-buy-upgrades-cosmeti-1851785508]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this summer, developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-developer-cancels-games-layoffs-coming/1100-6531972/" data-ref-id="1100-6531972">People Can Fly was hit by layoffs</a> and the cancelation of two unannounced projects. Now, two reports have indicated that one of the canceled games was Outriders 2, the sequel to the 2021 action-shooter that People Can Fly developed for publisher Square Enix.</p><p><a href="https://thethumbwars.com/outriders-2-revealed-to-be-one-of-people-can-flys-two-canceled-games-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Thumb Wars</a> was the first outlet to report the story, which was subsequently corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outriders-2-cancelled/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>. In June, People Can Fly explained that one of the canceled games--under the name Project Gemini--was suspended over issues with the game's publishers regarding its failure to give the developer assets it needed to continue. It also noted that the publisher failed to maintain a dialogue with People Can Fly that would allow the two sides to finish the project.</p><p>Insider Gaming identifies Project Gemini as Outriders 2, and Square Enix as the publisher in question. The outlet reports that Outriders 2 wasn't nearly as close to completion as The Thumb Wars' report suggested, but there were no firm answers about what went wrong between People Can Fly and Square Enix.</p><p>People Can Fly had already laid off developers of <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/pcf-organizational-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a separate game known as Project Bifrost</a> last December, but development continued with a smaller team until last month's layoffs. Regardless of the latest staff reductions, People Can Fly is still working on a number of other titles including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a> for Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-playstation-game-coming-from-gears-of-war-judgment-studio/1100-6530143/" data-ref-id="1100-6530143">Project Delta</a> for Sony, and <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/project-echo-agreement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Echo</a> for Krafton.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is out at last and its initial reception on Steam has been strong. The game has shot past 132,000 concurrent users as of writing, which isn't too shabby by any means. However, while plenty of people are playing it, initial reviews are mixed.</p>
<p>The reason is thanks to one thing: Microtransactions. Hordes of players eager to hop into the multiplayer mecha action shooter have found themselves shocked at how much customisation options are locked behind various currencies.</p>
<p>This has hit some especially hard. During the very popular demo released earlier this year which reached a peak of 317,522 concurrent players, many of these options were free. Customising your mecha pilot is a substantial part of the charm for many, who now find themselves burned a little.</p>

<p>The developers of Mecha Break - Amazing Seasun Games - were steadfast in keeping monetisation models for the full release a secret in the run up to the launch earlier today. Players were cautiously optimistic about how the developer was intending to make money, but it's clear what's turned up in the launch version of the game isn't what many expected.</p>
<p>"Was a huge fan of both the betas that came out, but instantly lost all desire to even start up a game after seeing how much of the customisation that was in the beta being either removed entirely, or added behind a paywall and user marketplace," wrote Steam user Vellie. "Don't even get me started on the 50 dollar bundle of skins that cannot be customised."</p>
<p>The $50 bundle they mention refers to the custom Falcon and accompanying pilot Leonie Fevre, which is currently for sale for £47.99  in-game for a limited time. In addition, seasonal sets can be bought for Corite (premium currency) which also rotate out of the shop in a month. Many of the hairstyles and pilot customisation options can only be bought with this currency.</p>
<p>There is a counter argument though. There's an in-game marketplace which allows players to sell items they acquire for Corite. So <em>theoretically</em> you can grab stuff without having to pay real money for it. However, this aforementioned bundle has a minimum market value attached. You can sell it on the marketplace for a <em>minimum</em> of 5,200 corite. It comes to roughly £45. Whichever way you slice it, pricey!</p>
<p>There are other problems people aren't happy about. One could argue Amazing Seasun Games has to make money somehow, that's just the reality of free-to-play games, but a change to its extraction battle royale mode Mashmak has some especially annoyed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-popular-multiplayer-game-steam-mecha-break">In the demo</a>, you were given cargo rockets allowing you to extract resources from the battle royale without leaving yourself, essentially ensuring some loot from each run.</p>
<p>These rockets are now no longer free, but somewhat rare consumables. As such, the Mashmak mode has become significantly more daunting for the casual player. It's now harder to get good loot out consistently, and it takes longer to accrue a stockpile of good stuff.</p>
<p>Even with all these valid concerns Mecha Break is at a mixed rating rather than negative, in large part due to the core gameplay still being fast-paced and enjoyable. Amazing Seasun Games have adjusted its game in the past following community feedback. Perhaps they will again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mecha-break-is-currently-the-eighth-most-played-game-on-steam-but-players-criticise-its-microtransactions]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're prone to passing the bread at the supermarket, totally forgetting you've already got plenty at home, picking some fresh up because you probably need bread, then realising later that you now own two full loafs with the same best before date, I have good news for you. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are taking action to stop something similar happening when people buy the game's Super Citizen Edition.</p>
<p>They're replacing the Steeled Veterans warbond in this special edition with a token that you'll be able to redeem for any one of the warbonds released for the game so far. The aim is to prevent those who're already Steeled Veterans owners - via in-game purchase or by upgrading to the Super Citizen Edition - accidentally buying the war bond again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-se/games/helldivers-2/latest-news-and-updates/?blog=JN9kex2X1qlKXB8&amp;article=BpwjMPDzY2rkga1&amp;slug=warbond-token-announcement">a post</a> from Arrowhead, the warbond token will replace the Steeled Veterans warbond in the Super Citizen Edition and the associated upgrade for the standard edition. The change comes into effect on August 26th 2025.</p>
<p>"We never want players to buy things twice and not get the value of what they paid for," the studio's social media and community manager Katherine Baskin wrote. I've no doubt that's true, but the bigger reason for the change is definitely to stop Arrowhead's support team from having to keep processing an endless supply of super credit refund requests from narked players who've ended up double warbonding.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Helldivers, we’ve been listening to our community and we’re here to let you know of an upcoming update to the HELLDIVERS 2 editions.</p><p>We’re introducing the Warbond Token! It&nbsp;will allow players who purchase the HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen Edition or HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen… <a href="https://t.co/3HxIRCeJ92">pic.twitter.com/3HxIRCeJ92</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1940384398966157800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you buy the updated Super Citizen Edition or Super Citizen Edition upgrade following this switch in August, you'll be given the Warbond Token when you next log into the game. To check it's there, hover over any warbonds you've not bought in the store and see if a "Claim Premium Warbond" button pops up. Arrowhead say there are no plans to sell tokens as standalone DLC at the moment.</p>
<p>So, there you go. No more accidentally ending up in a 2warbonds situation that leaves you 2furious, just because you were desperate to make sure you own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">every cape</a> in the cosmos.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-super-citizen-edition-is-being-updated-to-stop-folks-accidentally-buying-the-same-warbond-twice]]></content:encoded>

One of the best parts of <em>Rune Factory </em>is that you’re able to tackle all of its different game mechanics at your own pace. If you want to focus on tending your farm, you can dedicate as much time as you want without the urgency of continuing story progress.</p><p>As the second <em>Rune Factory</em> game on Switch, <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> performs much better on Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2) than the last game, <em>Rune Factory 5</em>. There aren’t nearly as many debilitating framerate issues this time around, which makes <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> a much smoother experience.</p><h2 id="h792710"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>?</h2><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is as long as you want it to be. Because of its flexible gameplay mechanics, <strong>you can spend dozens of hours simply farming, going out into the wilds, mining resources, and killing monsters for drops without advancing the story all that much.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-recommend-id="image://06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-recommend-id="image://06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s worth balancing your time between farming and going further into the story as you’ll receive new tools to tend to your farm. These can help expedite your process and make things easier.</p><p><strong>A full playthrough at a normal pace while engaging with the side activities like farming and hanging out with villagers will take about 40 hours to complete.</strong> <em>Guardians of Azuma </em>is a meaty game with plenty of content that rivals modern Japanese RPGs.</p><p>You can also max out the bond levels of your villagers and companions to learn about their various backstories and even romance some of them (there are a total of 16 romanceable characters). Same-sex relationships are supported, too. So whether you choose to play as the female protagonist Kaguya or the male protagonist Subaruru, you’re not short of any options.</p><p>Completionists are looking upwards to more than 120 hours in order to see everything that <em>Guardians of Azuma </em>has to offer.</p><figure id="" data-id="5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-recommend-id="image://5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-recommend-id="image://5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma </em>launches on June 5 for the original Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-how-long-story-farming-1851785504]]></content:encoded>
