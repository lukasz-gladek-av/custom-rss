			<p>At the Summer Game Fest 2025 in June, Icelandic developer Myrkur Games unveiled Echoes of the End, their debut game that had been in the works for several years. The title, a fantasy story-driven action/adventure game powered by Unreal Engine 5, is being published by Plaion (Deep Silver) and launches tomorrow on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2821610/Echoes_of_the_End/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>In a fantasy world called Aema, the main character, Ryn, a swordfighter who can also wield powerful magic, embarks on a mission to save her brother from a totalitarian empire. Along the way, she partners up with Abram Finlay, an older scholar haunted by his past.</p>



<p>Ahead of this new release, we had a nice, long chat with two of Myrkur Games' founders, CEO and Game Director Halldór Snær Kristjánsson and Senior Writer Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson, to learn more about their team and the project itself.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>First, please talk about how you met and established Mirkur Games as a studio.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> The three founders, myself and two others, actually met during our studies at university. We were all studying game development at the time. This was like 2016, somewhere around that time. We were in our final year and we actually met by chance: we were assigned to be a group in a game development project where we developed a small game in three weeks. During that time, we really clicked. We were working around the clock on this game; we were super passionate, it was palpable.</p>



<p>Through that period, we learned that we really liked working together. We decided to do our final project together, and eventually, we decided to form the studio together as well. At this time, the context is that Unreal Engine is still subscription-based and not yet mainstream. Everybody is still using Unity, and photogrammetry and motion capture are much less available to smaller developers, but this is changing.</p>



<p>We knew we were all headed towards this industry and wanted to work in it, but we realized at the time that the pivot happening with Unreal Engine, with availability and accessibility to hardware and software in the industry, was just a complete transformation. We had nothing to lose at that point. We were still living with her parents and could effectively take a big, long risk to pursue this dream of ours.</p>



<p>Soon after that, we started out as just the three of us, but quickly, the word started spreading to close friends and others, and we invited some people to generate ideas for the game and think about what we could be doing. Magnus joined one of those evenings, where we just sat around and talked about what kind of world we want to make, and he's kept showing up since. That was in 2017.</p>



<p><strong>Did you begin immediately working on the project that would become Echoes of the End?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We formed the studio during our time at university. We did actually work on a few different, smaller projects. We even did a VR project and stuff like that, but once we'd formed the studio, we sat down and took this long vision for this game. It's metamorphosized since, but really, we've been working through the years on different versions of this game, starting with just laying down the tech fundamentals, because making a game like this just takes so much infrastructure. There are so many building blocks that you need to put together and everything needs to click, so we started by first developing the very, very early prototypes of what we have today. We went out with a camera and scanned rocks around the city, trying to do smaller-scale motion capture, trying to build up those things, and then the basic systems of the game that take a long time to build.</p>



<p>We did that for a few years, and a couple of people joined on. Then, I believe in 2019, we had the fundamental building blocks in place, and we started building a full vertical slice for the game, which was around 20 to 30 minutes. That's probably when the game started to take shape. From there, we signed with Plaion and have been working on the game since about 2020 or 2021.</p>



<p><strong>How did you connect with Plaion and why did you choose them as the publisher of Echoes of the End?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We've been working with them for about five years now, and it's been a really good relationship. I believe we met around Gamescom, but I don't remember if we met at Gamescom. We met up with a few people there, and we had a few calls. We were talking to a lot of people back then. To us, Plaion seemed like the exact other half of what we were looking for.</p>



<p>They handled the publishing part of it because we're a new team. We're pretty green. A lot of us are pretty junior, but we're making something pretty cool. They really came in with lots of experience, both on how to get the game production down and, of course, funding for the project, which is absolutely critical, but also we got connected with a lot of good folks. It was just really obvious from the start that they were a really good match and exactly what we needed.</p>



<p><strong>You said that Plaion provided some funding. I guess that helped you expand the team, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Exactly.</p>



<p><strong>How many do you have right now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We're about 40 people right now. When we signed with Plaion, we were about 16.</p>



<p><strong><span>I read on the website that some team members</span> work in the office while others are remote, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> That's correct.</p>



<p><strong>How do you find this working for you? Some developers have gone nearly full remote, while most bigger ones are asking developers to return to the office. What's your take on this? Work from home, or work from the office?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> I would definitely say like for a project like this, because we were crafting a new IP, there was a lot of creative talking back and forth where we had to figure things out. When we started out, we didn't really have the world fully molded; we didn't have the level design of the metrics. All that stuff was just new, and then the team was also new, so it was quite pivotal for us during the period to have the majority of the team on location, just for that quick communication between the teams and idea generation.</p>



<p>They often talk about the kind of water-cooler chats where the best ideas don't come from sitting at a meeting and thinking about them, but once you stand up and go do something. I may be chatting with Magnus just on a walk, and we have this brilliant idea, and then we test that, so that's extremely valuable.</p>



<p>But we still have some remote employees in the company. We've tried to cultivate that quite a bit. They hang out in calls during most of the day, just with their team, instead of being offline the entire time. So, as they're working, it's kind of like having a coworker sitting next to you. It's optional, but most of them tend to do it. </p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> They've also all been here. There's nobody who has never met the team, never spent some time here in the office, plus part of it is just a false choice for us because we live on a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic, so we kind of have to.</p>



<p><strong>I guess that was my next question. Even the remote workers are still in Iceland, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We brought on quite a bit of talent from around the world. I don't know how many nationalities the studio currently has, like it's 11 or something like that. The problem is that, like Magnus was saying, not only being on an island in the middle of the Atlantic, but also the fact that there wasn't a studio similar to what we were trying to build in Iceland before. I mean, there's CCP and there's a lot of good talent there, but the expertise that we very specifically needed for this game was just kind of impossible to find here, so we had to go abroad when we were trying to recruit people and try to reach people all around the world and that's why we ended up with this highly multinational team, which is just fantastic in our eyes. They're coming from different studios, AA, AAA studios around the world, and brought some excellent experience for the team, especially early on in the meat of the production, that I think guided us in the right way.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> To clarify what you're asking, everyone working remotely is working from outside the country. Nobody is working remotely in our studio in Iceland.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/8-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>We tend to say that Iceland plays the same role in our game that New Zealand played in The Lord of the Rings movies. The game isn't set in Iceland; it just draws visual inspiration and basis from Iceland. It's the thing we're most qualified to showcase because we know it very well and we think it's beautiful and we know the things about it that inspire us to share what is beautiful about it. And also, it is popular, it's got appeal. People come to visit here, people come to see it, and I think the idea of basing a fantasy world on a place like that, a place that is a little different from most other places you'll go, has appeal.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Got it. Talking about Echoes of the End, I understand that its world is heavily inspired by Iceland, albeit through a fantasy lens, right?</strong> <strong>What inspired that, and what did you want to portray about your country in this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> We tend to say that Iceland plays the same role in our game that New Zealand played in The Lord of the Rings movies. The game isn't set in Iceland; it just draws visual inspiration and basis from Iceland. It's the thing we're most qualified to showcase because we know it very well and we think it's beautiful and we know the things about it that inspire us to share what is beautiful about it.</p>



<p>And also, it is popular, it's got appeal. People come to visit here, people come to see it, and I think the idea of basing a fantasy world on a place like that, a place that is a little different from most other places you'll go, has appeal. </p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> It also helps a grounded consistency, but there's definitely more than visual inspirations. For example, the Icelandic language does appear in Echoes of the End in a number of unique ways. We have different inspirations that we pulled from while still keeping in mind that this isn't real life, this is a fantasy world, and we got to set ourselves apart from the real bits as well.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> The Icelandic language is really mostly there as an Easter egg for the Icelanders.</p>



<p><strong>We talked about similarities and inspirations, but how does Aema differ from real-life Iceland, and what are the things that make it unique from other fantasy worlds that we see in other games?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> It's always a fun question to deal with because fantasy is so varied, right? But I would say it is fundamentally a low magic world. Not to say that magic doesn't exist, but to say that magic is the defining thing about it, right? The existence of magic is the fundamental point of its history and it's the reason for most of the historical events that have taken place. Thus, it is kind of the root of the story and Ryn's story as well. She's a vestige with this born connection to magic as a force.</p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Also, magic has just shaped the cultures in our game. I think we made magic pretty integral to how they employ the magic and how they build tools and weapons and stuff out of magic, so it's really built differently into the world and the backstory of the world as well.</p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> And then that also leads into the moment-to-moment experience and the visuals as well, because it trickles down throughout the entire production. But I would say the most unique things from my end are how we mix the fantasy and Icelandic elements. and the backdrop that Ma was talking about, I think that's really the main meat of EMA and what makes it appealing, to us at least.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> As we're talking about this Icelandic inspiration, sometimes I stumble upon little things that I didn't realize were inspired by being Icelandic, but there's this certain obsession with history. It's a story about characters, but the world is still defined by its past. The name Echoes of the End is chosen for a reason: it is a story defined by things that have already happened.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Echoes of the End is fundamentally a story about identity. It's a lot about Ryn struggling with identity and about Abram as well and how those struggles both mirror each other and complement each other and how, through their journey, they discover new things about who they are. The story kicks off with Ryn's father's death. And so to her, rescuing her brother is, again, part of her identity. It's: I have to be there because our father is dead, I have to save him. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Can you say anything about the story, or rather, its background? For example, what motivates the main character? What's going on at the beginning or shortly before that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> The main story is about two people, Ryn and Abram, the companion Abram and the main character Ren, who we see on the cover of the game. Really, the meat of the game is their relationship as it develops throughout the game and their mission. In terms of the plot and the setup, we play the game with Ren, and she initially doesn't quite know this strange companion. She meets him throughout the game and is kind of forced to align with him and work with him, but the premise of the game is that Ren is on a mission that she has to go and save her brother, who gets removed from her or separated from her by this invading force, which is also looking to invade the country. So she has a two-fold mission to save her brother and stop this invasion.</p>



<p>Ryn has her own struggles to deal with regarding the powers we described before. Those are a double-edged sword in the story and not as obvious as you might think. It's a struggle for her to deal with that magic and with the connection that she has, but she's also got to learn to trust this new companion. They've got to learn to work together and build this relationship. Earlier, we mentioned The Lord of the Rings. If you think about Sam and Frodo's journey and their development and how we root for them and think about them, I think Ryn and Abram definitely can have their highs, the lows, the good moments, the bad moments, and that's really the heart of the game.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> Echoes of the End is fundamentally a story about identity. It's a lot about Ryn struggling with identity and about Abram as well and how those struggles both mirror each other and complement each other and how, through their journey, they discover new things about who they are. The story kicks off with Ryn's father's death. And so to her, rescuing her brother is, again, part of her identity. It's: I have to be there because our father is dead, I have to save him. </p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> There's no one else and she's become responsible for him. </p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> I think exploring that identity of caretaker versus sibling versus friend is the personal drive of at least what kicks off the story.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking about the gameplay, you've described it as a cinematic third-person action adventure game. Would you compare it to something like the God of War reboots in terms of how it plays moment to moment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> I would say it is definitely an action/adventure story-driven game. First off the bat, it's not a Soulslike, we get that question a lot. In terms of combat, it will definitely be familiar if you play games like God of War or Star Wars: Jedi. Ryn has a sword and that's her main weapon, but where the game sets itself apart is with Ryn's abilities. She has two key abilities that really set her apart from others. One is an ability called shift, which is a kind of an analog ability that lets you relocate objects in any direction and aim. So you could throw an enemy into an enemy, you could throw an enemy of latch objects into enemies, and it's really fun to play around with and changes every fight and makes them feel different.</p>



<p>The other hallmark ability that she has is the ability called drain, which deeply connects to the lore of the character. It is her ability to siphon health from other enemies to her. It's a channeled ability, so it's also quite tactical because if you just stand around and use it, you might get attacked by other enemies.</p>



<p>So you really have to combine those abilities together to manipulate the enemies on the battlefield to create the opportunity to strike and to use your health recovery ability, but those are really only her main kit. On top of that, there are 40 different upgrades, and many of them are actually new abilities that she will uncover on the way, allowing her to tackle fights differently. And then Abram (we have two main companions in the game, but Abraham is definitely the main one) has his own set of abilities as well that you can upgrade as their journey goes along. They get better and better at fighting with each other, comboing with each other, using Abram's abilities and your abilities to get that critical hit or combo that you're looking to do.</p>



<p>In terms of the pacing of the combat, it's definitely fast, but it's not a hack-and-slash. It is more deliberate than many other games. You have to think of every step. Do I wanna attack, or do I want to use this ability or that ability? </p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> Battlefield control is a really big part of it, controlling where you are in relation to your enemies and putting your enemies where you need them to be.</p>



<p><strong>It's always interesting with games that feature companions because some of those games have the NPCs acting on their own through AI, but in others, you can tell them what to do. How does Echoes of the End work in this regard? Can you ask Abram to activate a specific ability?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Yeah, it's a hybrid between the two for sure. We really wanted the companion to be quite able in the game, and it was really tricky because the gameplay has of course combat, but we also have puzzles and we have platforming in the game. The companion has to be able to do all these different actions, like sliding and jumping and using ropes and whichever action is in the game. The same goes for puzzles. We wanted to integrate them into puzzles both autonomously but also in a way that you can work together and build into their story to solve puzzles in the game. But in terms of combat, Abram is quite active. He will create opportunities for the player. He will trip enemies, grab enemies, set up opportunities, and you can upgrade some very, very cool abilities that will open up more of those opportunities automatically.</p>



<p>In terms of activated abilities, you do have a number of activated abilities that you can ask him to trigger at the moment that you want, so it really is kind of a healthy combination of you being able to get the most powerful abilities out of him when you think they're gonna matter versus him also being quite dynamic and creating those opportunities for the player.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> The thing that keeps surprising me when I play is the fact that all of Abram's abilities are totally divorced from everything you're doing. So you can be in the middle of a drain. You can be in the middle of any animation and you can still use Abram's abilities because he's a different guy. That sounds like such a simple thing, but that's the thing I always have to think the most about.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>We really wanted the companion to be quite able in the game, and it was really tricky because the gameplay has of course combat, but we also have puzzles and we have platforming in the game.

<p><strong>I also wanted to know if Echoes of the End has any RPG elements, like looting or upgrading gear.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We're definitely a very small team. We're 40 people with the ambition of the game that we have. We definitely have some inklings of those elements, but the gear, for example, is something that kind of stays consistent. When you're playing Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, there's not really a gear upgrade. The upgrades primarily come through the abilities and the upgrades that the characters get. But in terms of RPG systems, I think probably one of them is the fact that you can have different conversations in the game with a companion and you can opt for different conversations and answer in different ways.</p>



<p>But you can definitely also find permanent upgrades throughout the game that will enhance different things in your kit, so there is an element of that, but it's not a strong focus in terms of like armor stats or something like that.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> There are four character progression skill trees.</p>



<p><strong>As you just said, Myrkur Games is not a large studio. According to your playtesting, how long can players expect Echoes of the End to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> The game length is generally, I would say, 14 to 15 hours during our playtests when we get people in to try the game out. It's longer than we set out to do. One of the reasons we offer for that as well is that we have 10 main chapters in the game, and each chapter in the game actually has a distinct not only environment and visuals, but we really wanted this game to feel like an adventure, like you're traveling throughout the different biomes and seeing different parts of the world, and that's exciting on a visual level, but also on top of that, each level will have their own kind of key mechanic in the game.</p>



<p>So as Ryn and Abram are going throughout the game, once you get into a new level, we're gonna throw a kind of new mechanics at you to interface with, and that's a promise that we give out to players. Once they play the first two chapters, they'll start to realize, okay, they're switching it up every so often. The way that we talk about this internally is that Ryn is a hammer and Abram is a screw, and they're solving problems together or dealing with different things. We always throw completely different problems, and those are usually tied to the biome that you're in and the story of the biome that you step into.</p>



<p>If you see in the announcement trailer, there's quite a few of those mechanics that we kind of tease. When you step into a new chapter, you get introduced to a mechanic and then we tend to expand them and make them more complex. And also, the enemies in each chapter will differ. We have about 20 unique enemies in Echoes of the End, and then of course, the bosses on top, and those are also quite tied to the themes of the chapters. So you might see an enemy in one chapter and not in any other.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/4-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The game length is generally, I would say, 14 to 15 hours during our playtests when we get people in to try the game out.

<p><strong>As a quick follow-up, is there any missable or optional side content in the game, or is it just linear?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Going back to the small team analysis, we definitely wanted to make sure that our main content was the thing that we focused on, really pack everything into the main punch. We often talk about games like Uncharted in that aspect internally, kind of wanting to do an action adventure, melee fantasy, but in the kind of same setup. Uncharted also has chapters in different environments, so that's a good comparison there. But still there's stuff to explore. Some of our levels are more open, and you can miss optional puzzles, things you can find, collectibles and upgrades, and definitely optional conversations you can get with a companion. But we don't have secondary missions in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Echoes of the End is about to launch now; I assume it's all-hands on deck time?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Yeah, we are making sure that every minute goes into final polish and we get everything on board that we want to. It's looking really good and we're pretty excited to get it out to players and show them what we've been doing for all these years.</p>



<p><strong>Good luck, and thank you for your time.</strong></p>

Kojima, who is now in his 60s, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-his-new-game-is-now-in-crunch-time-wonders-how-much-longer-he-can-stay-creative/1100-6528760/">is keenly aware that he can only remain active in game development</a> for as long as his body and mind holds out, but the veteran developer has <a

Trailer</p><div><p>         Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?       </p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/signup/">Sign up</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/login/">Sign

this content!</p></div><h2>OD platforms</h2><p>Since OD is a collaborative project between Kojima Productions and Xbox Game Studios, it's likely that we'll see it launch first on PC and Xbox Series X|S. The good news is that Microsoft has adopted a new multiplatform strategy for its first-party releases, so it's possible the game will launch elsewhere, too.</p><h2>OD story</h2><p>So far, only the teaser trailer embedded above exists for OD. In true Kojima fashion, it creates more questions than it answers as the video shows off three characters from the game as floating heads on a black background, all engaged in some top-notch acting. What's really impressive here is that they've all been rendered in Unreal Engine 5 and enhanced with MetaHuman--Kojima Productions had previously used the Decima Engine for its Death Stranding games--so you can only imagine how impressive things will look when the game eventually arrives.</p><p>Throughout the trailer, the characters also recite a pangram, and there are a <em>lot </em>of opinions on what it means. Is it a veiled zinger referencing Kojima's departure from Konami or just pure gibberish? Who knows, but here's the quote in full:</p><p>"The hungry purple dinosaur ate the kind zingy fox, the jabbering crab, and the mad whale and started vending and quacking."</p><h2>OD gameplay</h2><p>So what kind of a game is OD? <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-his-xbox-exclusive-game-od-is-risky-and-difficult-to-explain/1100-6526769/">Kojima isn't saying much</a>, but he did mention in an interview that the core concept is "a bit risky" and that it's hard to explain. "This is a game, but it's a game like no other. I can't go into too much detail, and it's also hard to explain," Kojima said. "But it's a bit risky and a new challenge for me within the realm of games."</p><p>To be fair, Death Stranding was also hard to explain before it was eventually released, as the third-person post-apocalyptic courier game introduced some wild ideas at the time. What we do know--<a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/OD-announcement" rel="nofollow ">thanks to the official synopsis</a>--is that OD will be a horror game of sorts and that it will feature performances by actors Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier.</p><p>"A Hideo Kojima game, OD explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear--while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film," the description reads. We also know that Kojima is partnering with Oscar-winning filmmaker Jordan Peele for OD, who knows a thing or two about creating unnerving content.</p><h2>OD screens</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545840-od-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545840-od-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545840"></a><figcaption>OD</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545840-od-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545841-od-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545842-od-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545843-od-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545844-od-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545845-od-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545841,1300-4545842,1300-4545843,1300-4545844,1300-4545845" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545841-od-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545842-od-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545843-od-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545844-od-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545845-od-6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545841-od-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545842-od-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545843-od-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545844-od-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545845-od-6.jpg"></figure>

			<p>Getting access to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/">Nintendo Switch 2 dev kit</a>&nbsp;requires following some rather strict guidelines aimed at ensuring that a game brings clear value to the platform.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Doctre81">Doctre81</a> in a new video shared on YouTube over the weekend, Nintendo partner LynxByte Games recently shared on social media some new information on Nintendo's current guidelines for getting access to a Nintendo Switch 2 dev kit. Simply porting a game over from the original system or any format does not automatically grant publishing rights on the new system as every game, even from existing partners, must be individually approved, with approval only being given to games that showcase the capabilities of the system by taking advantage of its features, including 4K support at 60 frames per second or up to 120 FPS at 1440p resolution in docked mode, implenting GameChat and mouse controls, supporting HD Rumble 2 and GameShare and more. Besides being a showcase of the system's capabilities, any developer pitching a game must clearly outline how their title brings value to the platform by leveraging some of these features, alongside a detailed release plan.</p>



<p>Besides revealing the above details regarding dev kit access, LynxByte Games also revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 seemingly supports NVIDIA DLSS 3.1. Although the version number, nowadays, doesn't mean a whole lot, given the different components of the upscaler such as Super Resolution and Frame Generation, which are not necessarily supported at all times, it was being speculated the system used some lightweight version of NVIDIA's tech with no direct correspondence to the different versions of DLSS seen in countless PC games so this sort of confirmation could be kind of interesting for a lot of reasons, although the upscaler is not being used much, at least by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/">first-party titles.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">6 million units</a>, developers are obviously very interested in releasing games for the system.

But according to the boss of Take-Two, Civ 7 is projected to meet the company's initial internal expectations over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7 has had a rough launch on Steam and has struggled for players on Valve’s platform ever since its launch in February. Reaction is ‘mixed,’ according to Steam user reviews. Civ 7’s Steam performance does not paint the entire picture, of course. The strategy game also launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (the Nintendo Switch 2 version and a VR version recently launched, too). But Civilization’s bread and butter is PC, and there Civ 7 is clearly struggling.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN to discuss Take-Two’s hugely positive financial results for the latest 2025 quarter, CEO Strauss Zelnick admitted Civ 7 had got off to a “slow start,” but he insisted that the company’s internal projections for what he called the “lifetime value” of Civ 7 still match its initial expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's definitely improving,” Zelnick said of Civ 7 (Take-Two has yet to announce a sales figure for the game).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the key thing is that Civ has always been a slow burn. It's always been a title that had — I'm not really a big believer in the long tail theory of the entertainment business — but Civ is an example of that theory. And right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So while we were off to a slow start and while we have had to make changes — and there are more changes coming — I feel like consumer uptake is better and better and we feel really good about the title. I think over time it's going to take its place in its civilization pantheon in a very successful, credible way.”</p><div id="rank-every-civilization-game" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank every Civilization Game</h3><h3>Rank every Civilization Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When Civ 7 launched, players highlighted issues with the user interface, a lack of map variety, and expressed a feeling that the game launched without a number of features they’d come to expect from the franchise. But some veteran Civ fans also didn’t get on well with the dramatic changes developer Firaxis made to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Civilization games have never had such a system, and it has proven divisive. But Firaxis has launched a number of key updates to Civ 7 since launch, most recently patch 1.2.3, which made Age Transition improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, can Firaxis turn Civilization 7 sentiment around from its current ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, and get more people to make the jump from past Civ games to the latest effort?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more from our interview with Strauss Zelnick, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death">his thoughts on controversial Borderlands developer Randy Pitchford</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">his response to recent reports around the troubled BioShock 4</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>A trilogy remaster of the first three Dragon Age games was pitched by BioWare to EA, but the publisher is "against remasters" and "basically seem to be against free money".</p>
<p>That's according to Dragon Age series veteran Mark Darrah, who was interviewed by YouTuber MrMattyPlays. Darrah was executive producer on the first three games, but has since left BioWare.</p>
<p>The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> games received a trilogy remaster in the Legendary Edition, released in 2021. So why hasn't Dragon Age received the same treatment?</p>

<p>Darrah discussed why the sci-fi series was favoured by EA. "The problem Dragon Age has had, charitably I guess, would be to say that EA wants mainstream success and it's hard - or at least it has historically been hard - for corporate people, people who come from the sports side of the organisation to look at a game like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, which is super nerdy, not very attractive looking, and say 'this is a mainstream game'," said Darrah.</p>
<p>"They don't see it [with Dragon Age]. They look at Mass Effect, they can see it…there's just been a lot of difficulty with them, there's always been a push for [Dragon Age] to be more mainstream, more accessible. So it's always had this either pressure to be something different, or more - in the case of something like Inquisition - a reaction to that."</p>
<p>A remaster of the first three Dragon Age games was soft pitched by BioWare and was to be released as The Champions Trilogy.</p>
<p>However, Darrah said EA is "against remasters", though doesn't know why. "It's strange for a publicly traded company," he said, "they basically seem to be against free money."</p>
<p>The other issue is that a Dragon Age remaster would be harder to achieve than Mass Effect, in part because the three games were made in different engines. As such, a Dragon Age remaster would either need to be done by a different team (the studio even considered hiring a mod house), or it would need to be done in-house.</p>
<p>That then brings issues of resources, which were already split at BioWare between the Mass Effect team and the Dragon Age team working on Veilguard. No further resources were available for an additional remastered trilogy.</p>
<p>Darrah believes BioWare will work better as a studio with one project at a time, to avoid "open warfare over resources".</p>
<p>This matches <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-mass-effect-and-dragon-age-teams-didnt-get-along-former-dev-claims">comments made by Dragon Age creator David Gaider</a>, who's also since left the company, that staff working on the two franchises "didn't get along".</p>
<p>It does, however, bring into question the future of the Dragon Age series, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">poor reception to Veilguard</a>. "I think there are more games to be made there," said Darrah, "but I'm not sure how it gets started right now."</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds">interview with Eurogamer after the release of Veilguard</a>, series creative director John Epler admitted it was "never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran]]></content:encoded>

<p>Enter this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/23187?tab=description">"story-driven rent system"</a> that modder DarkFortuneTeller has put together. Once it's installed, the five main apartments you can live in across Night City require regular rent payments if you want to avoid being evicted. All of this is communicated and maintained by "an eclectic cast of real estate agents, chat bots, and landlords" that the mod establishes as characters via a series of over 450 new text messages they'll send you at various points.</p>
<p>When you lay down that initial payment on a flat, which the mod treats as a security deposit, you'll get a message from your soulless chatbot or soulless human landlord introducing themselves. I assume it feels like the opening to a Souls boss fight, except this time with a selfie that wouldn't feel out of place on your aunt or uncle's Facebook profile. "They each have a unique personality (and a few surprises) that I hope you enjoy discovering," DarkFortuneTeller writes of these leech-like Lichdragon Fortissaxes.</p>
<p>One of them even has a loyalty quest you can complete to earn a discount on your rent and the option to buy the Glen apartment outright. The modder plans to add more of these quests via future updates, as well as extra "special requests" that look to work like hotel room service for the swankier digs. You'll be glad to learn they've already implemented the ability for toffs who buy the Corpo Plaza flat to order flowers delivered to their pad, I assume in case their mum visits.</p>

<p>"The goal was to add an additional layer of storytelling and difficulty, without dominating the entire gameplay experience," DarkFortuneTeller wrote of their work, "In the early game, you should feel the added pressure of making sure you have enough to cover the rent at the end of the week. You may even decide to downsize by moving out of Megabuilding H10 to save a few eddies. You'll also need to make choices about how many apartments you should rent at once."</p>
<p>In line with that, the game's first act doesn't require you to pay any rent. Then, once V's found their feet and gained a certain brain passenger, they're introduced via text to an estate agent called Bob. Bob can help you do things like move in and out of different flats, with those you've moved out of no longer requiring rent payments. How often rent must be paid, and several other aspects of the mod's systems, can be tweaked via an in-game menu that uses <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>.</p>
<p>Impressively detailed realism-themed mods like this one are usually a bit hit-or-miss for me, but I reckon this might well be one I give a go, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-money-making-how-to-make-eddies-fast">fairly easily afforded</a> nearly all of the game's flats only a bit of the way into Act 2 of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">post-2.3 update</a> Cyberpunk playthrough I started a couple of weeks ago. After all, there's nothing like having to pay tribute to wrathful deities who can chuck you onto the streets at a whim to really make those side-gigs feel more meaningful. If you fancy giving it a go, you'll also need Cyberpunk load order staples <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies]]></content:encoded>

              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta weekend drew in over a half a million people playing at the same time, smashing the all-time concurrent player record of <em>Call of Duty</em>. People, we have ourselves a good-old-fashioned FPS game-off.</p> <p>In these awful times, where ludicrous shareholder expectations and bigwig dividends drive publishers into wantonly firing hundreds of developers at a time, gaming rivalries feels like such an anachronism. There used to be a time when we could revel in two major franchises going head-to-head, massive companies trying to outdo the other, albeit with legions of overly-invested fans on either side spoiling it with their fervor. Now, that just sounds like a recipe for at least one well-respected development team getting wiped out.</p> <p>But, if there’s any franchises that can survive an old-fashioned two-game race, it’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>. In fact, most of the previous big-noise battles involved <em>Call of Duty</em> at some point–the very first game in 2002 was created by a bunch of <em>Medal of Honor</em> devs who’d walked out on EA after a contract dispute, setting up its first rivalry. But for a very long time now, <em>CoD</em> has walked alone, dominating the holiday season every year no matter how mediocre it might be. Not this year though.</p> <p>This weekend, as recorded by&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em>, the public beta for EA’s&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079</a> concurrent players. The best&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> has ever managed is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">491,670</a>. Now, those&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>numbers are hardly to be sniffed at, but it’s worth remembering this is based on the combination of both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em> combined, and indeed after the extremely mainstream game has been available to buy in stores, as well as being the first&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> to be included day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. Then, if you want to argue for the other side, the&nbsp;<em>BF6</em> weekend was free and didn’t require pre-ordering the game, so might not be at all representative of how many people will show up to buy the game when it launches October 10.</p>

 <p>Still, EA must be dancing foot to foot. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-huge-player-count-steam-beta-jurassic-forza-castle-crashers-2000616307">The beta had over 300,000 trying to play it</a> before it even started, and then generated headlines with both <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">how people were playing</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">how others were cheating</a>. Beating a Goliath like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, no matter the specifics, must be giving everyone involved a lot of confidence in the new game, especially following <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654">the extremely muted response</a> to 2021’s <em>Battlefied 2042</em>, even <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-2-two-02-impressions-dlc-1849496591">after a year of fixes and updates</a>, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-refund-petition-ea-bf2042-change-1848524654">hundreds of thousands demanding their money back</a>.</p> <p>Of course, we have no idea how many people&nbsp;<em>total</em> played the beta. Concurrent player numbers are the only real measure we have, and while a very useful measure of popularity, don’t give us the whole picture. It could be that half a million people played total, all showing up at once, or that the 480,000 who played on Sunday were made up of many people who weren’t included in Saturday’s peak. Only EA could tell us, and unless they skew enormously favorably, likely won’t.</p> <p>Whether these numbers will be replicated on release remains to be seen. Activision is being extremely shy about&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s release date, only pinning it down to before the end of 2025. My guess is that the publisher will avoid releasing too close to the initial buzz for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, perhaps opting for an early November date, hoping to pick up players who’ve burned out after a month of <i>Battlefield</i> and are looking for their next game. That’s not going to stop anyone (including us) comparing the two games in meticulous detail, of course.</p> <p>There’s a second, extended open beta weekend for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;this week, starting Thursday 14 through Sunday 17.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Several reports indicate that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat software is asking players to remove Valorant from their systems. </p>



<p>Electronic Arts announced that Battlefield 6’s open beta was their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta to date</a>. However, the test version of the game was plagued by cheaters, with BF6’s anti-cheat engine blocking over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">330,000 cheating attempts</a>. Interestingly, the same cheat engine seems to be facing an issue with Valorant. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-anti-cheat-wants-players-to-uninstall-valorant">Battlefield 6 Anti-Cheat Wants Players to Uninstall Valorant </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-anti-cheat-valorant-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, several reports about Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine facing issues with Valorant have surfaced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Battlefield</a>. All the reports include a screenshot of the same ‘Security Violation’ pop-up, which states that BF6 failed to launch due to ‘general software incompatibility’. The pop-up further asks players to “uninstall the conflicting software, or adjust its settings”, and the software in question is Valorant. </p>

            <p>On 9th September, Riot Games' fighting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> will release into its closed beta. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-free-to-play-fighter-officially-named-2xko">first announced officially in February 2024</a>, would appear to the layperson as a quick turnaround. The reality for those who have kept their eyes peeled for any crumb of info about the game couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Back in March 2016, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment/">Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment</a>, developers of forward-thinking fighter Rising Thunder. It's here that whispers about a Riot fighting game first circulated. Then, in 2019, Riot Games revealed the then-called <strong>Project L</strong> as part of the publisher's 10th anniversary. This 1v1 fighter would later be scrapped, with development restarting towards the 2v2 duo play fighting game we have today.</p>
<p>The consequence of this timeline is that for the ultra dedicated 2XKO fans, this game has been almost a ten years in the waiting. For those with a decent memory, six years and counting. As such a perception has risen among a portion of the fighting game fanbase, one of impatience and general confusion as to why things have taken so long.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>At Evo 2025, I sat down with both 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon and game director Shaun Rivera, and asked whether the game was revealed too early, and the conflict between what the team considers the 'proper reveal' versus the 'perceived reveal' of a game a decade in the making. Would they go back and re-think the reveal of Project L if they could?</p>
<p>"I don't know that I would," says Tom Cannon. "For sure, there was a cost to doing that. It puts a clock in player's minds, now the meme is [that there's been] nine years of development. The reality was that we were deep in R&amp;D when we showed that. But we needed the player's reaction to that announcement to sort of kick us in the butt, and inspire us to make something that was… special and different."</p>
<p>Cannon continues: "On the timeline when we don't do that, I don't know if we end up with <strong>this</strong> game. There were costs for sure, but y'know, when we showed that we paid a lot of attention to how fighting game fans were reacting. The reaction we got was 'oh wow, that looks interesting, I'll check it out'. We wanted people jumping out of their chairs! We didn't get that reaction, so we had to do better and take it back to the shop."</p>
<p>Rivera shares Cannon's lack of regret on the matter, pointing to the openness of the development process as a strength of 2XKO, and Riot Games in general: "For our team, we haven't spent decades making a fighting game. We're learning as we go. One of the things that I really love about working at Riot - I just celebrated my 13th anniversary - this company really encourages all their developers working there to talk to players. When I think back to myself when I played fighting games a long time ago, I wanted to know what the developers were thinking.</p>
<p>"The fact we have this opportunity to put this game in front of players like in Alpha Lab 1 and 2, and at Evo, it's something I'm pumped about. To your point, hey, has it been too long? I think people just want to play the game. But we're learning as we go through, and we have this date now: 9th September."</p>

</figure>
<p>While, these days, information and play tests for 2XKO are abundant, those early years were often islands composed of teases separated by oceans of radio silence. Can anything be done about the perceived development time for Riot's fighting game? Rivera doesn't believe so.</p>
<p>"Not really. Honestly, once Radiant was acquired, there's a lot of amazing folks who worked on Rising Thunder who are still on our team today - Tom and Tony included. We're sitting at Evo, right? Once people hear that and go, 'cool, fighting game when?' With the first 1v1 version of the game we tested with players before my time, there was a feeling that it was cool, but that it wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>"I've been on the project for five years, we made the choice to make a 2v2 duo play game. It's a big difference, right? This version of the game has not been the full length of time, but there's no way to avoid that acquisition."</p>
<p>When asked if this perception versus reality is a problem, he concluded by stating there's only one thing the team can do about it: get the game in front of people and build from there.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you've just got to deal with it, you know. This is one of those instances where there was a lot of love for Rising Thunder, Tom and Tony.  It's no surprise that there's excitement around that. It's something we've got to push through, and at the end of the day the way you solve it is by getting the game in front of players and keep making it better over time."</p>
<p>With 2XKO, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-2xko-riot-aims-to-make-a-beginner-friendly-fighting-game-but-will-that-ever-be-possible">Riot aims to make a beginner-friendly fighting game</a>, and taking this long in development is a key aspect of that plan. We're going to have to wait just a little bit longer, though, to see whether that decision - and the cost of the notably early reveal - will bear any fruit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/was-riot-games-fighting-game-2xko-revealed-too-early-interview]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developers of Pokémon TCG Pocket, DeNA, have revealed that they are aiming to release a ‘major update’ in 2025. </p>



<p>During the latest earnings <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/2432/ir_material3/256980/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, DeNA revealed several details about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s progress over Q1 FY2025 and their future actions. The report states that average monthly active users for the first quarter were approximately 39 million. Close to 60% of the virtual currency consumption came from international markets, and subscriptions are seeing “steady demand”.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-major-update-will-focus-on-retention-and-login-frequency">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Major Update will Focus on Retention and Login Frequency</h2>



<p>Regarding future actions, DeNA states that “New user acquisition remains steady”; however, the retention rate of existing users is decreasing compared to the initial launch period. Maintaining a monthly active user base has become a priority for them. The developers have recognised “initiatives to improve retention rate and login frequency, such as enhancement of collection experience.”</p>



<p>The developers are now planning and developing a “major update” for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which will focus on improving the retention rate and login frequency of users. The details of this update will be announced later; however, we do know that DeNA is planning to release it “within this calendar year”. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1266852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent claim suggests that a LEGO Batman game inspired by LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is scheduled to release in 2026. </p>



<p>The last LEGO title players received was Horizon Adventures, based on PlayStation’s popular series. Since then, we have received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-announced-for-september-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for a new game, LEGO Party, which is an upcoming 4-player party game. Now, reports indicate that a LEGO Batman game is in development, scheduled for release in 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-cover-multiple-movies-in-skywalker-saga-style">LEGO Batman Will Cover Multiple Movies in Skywalker Saga Style</h2>



<p>Details about the LEGO Batman title, following the style of The Skywalker Saga, come from LEGO Game News on <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The account had previously reported on a <a href="https://x.com/legottnewsi/status/1947420735846420926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumour</a> that stated the next LEGO game by TT Games will follow multiple movies based on Batman. Moreover, the game could potentially be revealed at Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live. </p>



<p>Their new post follows up on the previous rumour, stating “The next Game is a Skywalker Saga styled LEGO Batman that is not connected to the original trilogy (Due Spring 2026).” In the comment section, the user has also stated that there’s a strong chance that this game will feature “one Gotham city and you can choose the era.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ICYM: Here’s an overall review of the 2023 TT Games RUMORS that occurred in January of that year with little more extra context. </p><p> – LEGO Disney and the LEGO Marvel Guardians Game was cancelled</p><p> – A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game was in the pitch stage, but… <a href="https://t.co/1Pz5PCH2xH">pic.twitter.com/1Pz5PCH2xH</a></p></div>— LEGO Games News (@LEGOTtNewsI) <a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was a title that allowed players to start playing from any trilogy and included all nine films. Players were also able to visit different popular locales from the Skywalker Saga films, with the game allowing them to unlock and explore 23 other planets. </p>



<p>The same post also provides players with information on other LEGO games that were cancelled. It seems LEGO Disney and LEGO Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy were scrapped. Furthermore, there was also “A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game” being pitched, but it never went past it.” Players should approach these details about the LEGO Batman game and other titles cautiously, as they lack official confirmation.</p>



<p>In other news, a LEGO Nintendo Game Boy set is scheduled for release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-price-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early October</a>. Also, here’s Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> of LEGO  Party!

            <title><![CDATA[Crossfire: Rainbow Is a Horror-Themed New Entry in the Shooter Franchise]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/crossfire-rainbow-horror-themed-new-entry-shooter-franchise/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crossfire-rainbow-is-a-horror-themed-new-entry-in-the-shooter-franchise.1266846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Crossfire franchise is about to expand with a new installment that looks very different from most of its predecessors. The series was created by Smilegate in 2007 and had enormous success, especially in China, as a tactical first-person shooter centered on objective-oriented game modes. For a while, it was even reportedly the most played game in the world before League of Legends surpassed it in 2017.</p>



<p>Smilegate tried to conquer the West, too, with CrossfireX, a new entry made specifically for the Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X consoles with the help of Remedy Entertainment, who handled the single player campaign portions. The single player was premium, while multiplayer was free-to-play. Even so, CrossfireX  utterly failed, receiving negative scores from critics and shutting down around fifteen months after its launch. Here on Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crossfirex-no-remedy-for-global-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 4/10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Remedy’s inclusion into CrossfireX’s single-player campaign is perhaps the best part of the package that I could recommend. With extremely dated multiplayer mechanics that have been bandaged up with all of the modern retention techniques to keep players coming back to the mediocre shooter fare, CrossfireX is certainly a title that I wouldn’t be looking to recommend for anyone looking for their weekend FPS fix. Once you take away Remedy’s campaign offerings and look purely at Smilegate Entertainment’s multiplayer component, you’re left with a shooter mode that ultimately feels cheap despite how much effort is spent into extracting money and time from the player.</em></p>



<p>After that attempt, Smilegate tried a real-time strategy game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/crossfire-legion-full-version-release-date-free-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossfire: Legion</a> and made by the franchise veterans at Blackbird Interactive (Homeworld 3). That game received better reviews but didn't really gain a fanbase, either, and will be delisted next week on Steam.</p>



<p>Now, Smilegate has unveiled a new title called Crossfire: Rainbow. This is once again a first-person tactical shooter, but with a heavy horror theme, from the looks of it. It also only shows the main player, suggesting this won't be an online title, although it may still have multiplayer modes for all we know.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Indeed, only scant details are available online at this time, although an official website can be found <a href="https://cfh.qq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. We'll monitor any new information worth reporting on this intriguing project. </p>

<p>The first Battlefield 6 open beta has ended after an intense weekend of record-breaking action, but that’s not the end of the line for the game. Electronic Arts has lined up a second test that’ll come later this week, but <strong>when does the Battlefield 6 beta end </strong>for good? And when it does, what are your options?</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about the Battlefield 6 beta end times and where it goes from there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-beta-end-times">Battlefield 6 Beta End Times</h2>



<p>The next Battlefield 6 open beta is scheduled to run from August 14 (08:00 UTC) to August 18 (08:00 UTC). That means the end time for the next Battlefield 6 open beta is at 01:00 PT / 04:00 AM ET on August 18. You’ll get an entire four-day window to play Battlefield 6, but it could be your last chance until the game comes out on October 10.</p>



<p>That brings me to your options going forward.</p>



<p>Once you’ve enjoyed the Battlefield 6 beta, you’re free to sit back and wait until October to get your hands on the full game, <strong>or </strong>you can try your luck with Battlefield Labs, which <strong>should </strong>reopen following the end of the Battlefield 6 beta.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">how to get into Battlefield Labs</a>.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta went nuts during the first weekend of play, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">more than 500,000 players</a> joining the fun on Steam <strong>alone</strong>. It skyrocketed on platforms like Twitch, hitting almost 900,000 concurrent viewers, far more than any Call of Duty game (except Warzone) has ever managed.</p>



<p>The second round of the Battlefield 6 beta isn’t expected to be any different from the first, but feedback gathered during the opening window will help shape some of the balancing tactics going into the second stage.</p>



<p>Have you already been enjoying the game and are wondering when the Battlefield 6 beta ends? Let me know if you’re disappointed that it’ll be over soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dragon Age, like Mass Effect, didn’t have the best time when its most recent title was released. In October 2024, BioWare and Electronic Arts dropped Dragon Age: Veilguard, which wasn’t well received by audiences, much like 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. However, Mass Effect has an advantage over Dragon Age in that the series boasts a trilogy remaster.</p>



<p>When recently challenged on why Dragon Age doesn’t have a trilogy remaster, or a ‘Legendary Edition’, former BioWare executive producer of more than 20 years, Mark Darrah, explained what’s up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-it-with-the-money-you-have">‘Do It With The Money You Have’</h2>



<p>Mark Darrah departed BioWare in 2022 after spending 24 years rising through the ranks at the company. He saw some of the most popular games of certain eras go out the doors at BioWare, including the Mass Effect ‘quadrilogy’ and every Dragon Age game bar last year’s Veilguard.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with MrMattyPlays, Darrah got onto the topic of a Dragon Age trilogy remaster (not remake) in the vein of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition, explaining why it probably won’t ever be a thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I honestly think they should do – I don’t think they will – but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things we pitched at one point, pretty softly, was to retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy and call it the Champion’s Trilogy.</p>



<p>Maybe you do that, and as a first step, you take those three games (and maybe Veilguard), you shine them up, you re-release them, probably remaster, not a remake, see what happens, and then maybe go from there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Darrah highlighted the stark similarities between the ‘states’ of the Mass Effect franchise and the Dragon Age franchise, but admitted that the latter is much harder to remaster than the former. Not only that, but there’s <strong>no money </strong>coming from EA to support the idea:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>EA has said this publically, they’re kind of against remasters. I don’t really know why, it’s strange for a publically-traded company to seem to be against free money, but they seem to be against it, so that’s part of it.</p>



<p>The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do.</p>



<p>One of the earliest things was, let’s do Frostbite Tools, and then let’s find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age Origins.</p>



<p>There were lots of pitches around it, is there a way we can bring Dragon Age Origins forward?</p>



<p>The studios ruin their financials within themselves. I think, to some degree, EA’s stance was, ‘Sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have.’ We couldn’t do it with the money that we already have, because we’re doing all these other things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full interview can be seen here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Dragon Age: Veilguard scored well in the review stakes when it was released last year, but failed to resonate with the general audience, as reflected in its low aggregate scores on platforms like Steam. </p>



<p>Do you think a Dragon Age trilogy remaster could revive the franchise a little? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, former BioWare veteran Mark Darrah revealed that Electronic Arts refused several pitches from the studio to remake or remaster Dragon Age: Origins and, potentially, the second and third game, too. </p>



<p><em>I'm not pitching a Dragon Age to EA right now. I don't know what I'd want to do, to be honest, to go forward with it. I mean, I honestly think they should do - I don't think they will, but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things that we pitched at one point, pretty softly so pitch is a massive overstatement, was to kind of retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy. We'd call it the Champions trilogy, so you have these big, larger-than-life heroes. You've got the Hero of Ferelden, you've got the Champion of Kirkwall, and then you've got the Inquisitor. I think as a first step, you take those three games, and maybe Veilguard, you shine them up, re-release them, and see what happens and go from there.</em></p>



<p>Darrah, an Executive Producer on the first three Dragon Age games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a consultant on the fourth</a>, said that the publisher has been historically reluctant to do remasters. While they did the successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-highest-concurrent-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> a while ago, that was made easier by the fact that all those games were powered by Unreal Engine technology, whereas Dragon Age: Origins was powered by the proprietary Eclipse Engine, DAII by the Lycium Engine (an upgraded version of the Eclipse), and Inquisition by Frostbite.</p>



<p><em>EA has historically been, and I don't really know why but they've even said this publicly, they're kind of against remasters. I don't really know why. It's strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. That's part of it. The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do; to some degree, unknowably harder. Maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder.</em></p>



<p><em>One of the very earliest things for Joplin was, let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age: Origins. There were lots of pitches around, 'Is there a way we can bring Dragon: Age Origins forward?'</em></p>

            <p>If you've been wondering just how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Secure Boot requirement and anti-cheat system Javelin have been holding up during Battlefield 6's gargantuan open beta test, AC from EA's Anti-Cheat team has revealed that during the Open Beta alone, Javelin has blocked over 300,000 attempted cheat efforts and reviewed 100K+ potential cheaters.</p>
<p>"Your reports help us zero in and lead us to finding up-and-coming cheat communities, reporting one actual cheater often can lead to new detection techniques and help us keep them from impacting your experience," <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">AC explained in a forum post updated over the weekend</a>. "Anti-Cheat isn't one and done, it's an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn't always work in all of them."</p>

<p>"Since Open Beta Early Access’s launch, Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls, and [players have] reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today," AC added.</p>
<p>"We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters."</p>
<p>For those wondering why DICE was requiring Secure Boot in the first place, AC explained that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet".</p>
