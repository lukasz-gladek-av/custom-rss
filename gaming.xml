            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 was somewhat of a quiet year for PlayStation. Yes, we got the Game of the Year-nominated Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Sucker Punch’s exciting sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei. But aside from that, there wasn’t really a lot of activity from Sony’s first-party studios. Instead, you had to look to developers outside of Sony’s stables, who thankfully kept the PS5 ticking over with an array of interesting games. Right at the back end of 2024, Infold launched the console-exclusive Infinity Nikki and has been delighting stylists around the globe over the past 12 months, and smaller projects such as Sword of the Sea, Dispatch, and Baby Steps have all been enjoyed on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the fact that there were not many console <em>exclusives</em> didn't mean there weren't a whole host of great games to play on our PS5s last year. Quite the opposite, in fact. Awards-sweeper Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and acclaimed RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 led the third-party offerings. Plus, 2025 really was the year of Xbox going fully multiplatform with its library, as Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War Reloaded, and The Outer Worlds 2, to name just a few, all made their way to PlayStation. And that’s showing no signs of slowing down in the coming year, either, with a certain Master Chief set to grace a Sony console for the first time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The truth is, Sony has just been pretty quiet when it comes to exclusives of its own, with little new to shout about from a hardware perspective, either. And that’s before we even get into the problems Bungie (now a PlayStation Studio, remember) has faced with Marathon. So, are things looking more exciting in 2026? Well, Marathon will certainly be hoping so as it aims to combat PlayStation’s recent live-service travails. Let’s dig into it, as well as everything else to expect from Sony this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>First-Party and Exclusives </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into 2026, all eyes are on Logan, as Insomniac aims to bolster its long winning streak of Ratchet and Clank and Spider-Man games by taking on another comic book hero. Marvel’s Wolverine is currently pencilled in for a “late 2026” launch, although we’ll see if those plans change at all due to a certain Rockstar game moving to a similar timeframe. Whenever it does release, though, we look to be in for a treat if our first look at gameplay during September’s State of Play is any indication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While much is still yet to be revealed about its story, we’re eager to learn more and see just who else from the X-Men and the wider Marvel Universe will be popping into Logan’s world. Mystique and Omega Red have already been confirmed, but surely Sabretooth is a must, as well as a cameo at the very least from either of Insomniac’s Spideys, Peter Parker or Miles Morales. Which of the X-Men do you want to see most? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for PS5 exclusives that actually have release dates confirmed, there’s only Saros, Nioh 3, and Phantom Blade Zero. The former is Housemarque’s follow-up to the acclaimed Returnal, and looks to be sitting in a similar mould of colourful, particle-filled, challenging shooter within an alien planet shell. Now arriving on April 30 after a slight delay, it will take players on an expedition to a lost colony as we step into the shoes of Rahul Kohli’s Arjun Devraj and kill and die our way to uncovering its mysteries through its repeating, roguelike structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nioh 3 is a console exclusive for PlayStation, as it's also arriving on PC when it launches on February 6. A chronological sequel to the events of the series’ first game, Team Ninja is back with a fresh dose of its own brand of punishing soulslike action in feudal Japan. Things are being shaken up this time, though, thanks to the introduction of a “ninja playstyle” which promises to control completely differently from the traditional samurai option. Trust a studio called Team Ninja, which is also responsible for the Ninja Gaiden series, to want to add ninjas to Nioh. That's enough ninjas for one sentence, I think. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero is a hotly anticipated wuxia action RPG coming from Chinese developer S-Game. The lead character is called Soul, so you can probably guess what genre this project also borrows heavily from, too. I can confirm this myself – after briefly going hands-on with it at gamescom 2025, I found that there is indeed a punishing combat system with a complex skillset to master. But there are other action game influences, too, so the combat tempo is much higher than in your typical Soulslike. Up for some punishment? Well, you’ll have to hold on a little longer yet, as Phantom Blade Zero will be released on September 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto the stuff we’re led to believe will be coming in 2026, we just don’t know when yet. First up is Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, the new superhero fighting game from Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works. A uniquely stylised interpretation of the Marvel universe, it looks set to be a real contender in the fighting game community if its recent closed betas are anything to go by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Freshly revealed at The Game Awards, 4:Loop is a new co-op shooter from Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth and Bad Robot Games, the video game wing of film director J.J. Abrams' production company. A PS5 and PC exclusive, it seems to infuse some roguelike elements with a sprinkling of Helldivers and Left 4 Dead. No release date has been given yet, but playtesting will start soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then we have Marathon, the new extraction shooter from Destiny developer Bungie, which was initially meant to arrive in 2025, but had a rough year to say the least. Delayed into this year and now coming out in March, the studio will be hoping for a big comeback story this year and buck the trend of recently failed Sony live-service shooter offerings such as Concord. Instead, it’ll be looking to the likes of the wildly successful Arc Raiders and PlayStation’s very own Helldivers 2 for a template to follow. Shooter pedigree doesn’t come much stronger than Bungie, so fingers crossed that it can turn around those initial impressions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of live-service shooters, Fairgames is reportedly still in development at Haven Studios despite the departure of its founder, Jade Raymond, in May of 2025, and even more recently, the game’s creative director, Daniel Drapeau, leaving in September. With still no gameplay to be seen and no sign of a release date for this “competitive heist shooter”, serious questions now have to be raised about whether it will ever see the light of day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Laser swords more your cup of tea? Well, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet might be the one for you. We’re very much dreaming if we think this is coming any earlier than 2027, but hopefully, we get a good look at gameplay for Naughty Dog’s new sci-fi game over the next 12 months. Expectations are high from one of Sony’s most beloved developers, though, with creator Neil Druckmann calling it the “most ambitious game” they’ve ever made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about all of those other PlayStation studios cooking up exclusives? Well, Guerrilla may not be developing the recently revealed mobile MMORPG Horizon: Steel Frontiers itself, but has been recruiting for its own multiplayer entry into Aloy’s universe. Could we see that in 2026? What about Santa Monica’s next project? Is it finally time to see what Cory Barlog’s mystery game is, if a new God of War isn’t imminent? All good questions. None of which I have the answers for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could run through each of the remaining Sony studios here, but, truthfully, I did that back in August, and very little has changed since. So, you can read that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-state-of-every-playstation-studio-summer-2025-update"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Third-Party and Multiplatform</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another look forward to the year ahead in games, and another opportunity for me to say how excited I am for GTA 6. <em>Surely, </em>after its most recent delay to November, 2026 is the year we finally get our hands on the latest Grand Theft Auto. Please, Rockstar, don’t do it to us again.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our loss is a bunch of games’ gain, though, with Spring opening up wide for a fair few to fill that GTA-shaped void. These include Capcom’s latest entry into its legendary horror series, Resident Evil Requiem and IO Interactive’s first non-Hitman project in a long time, James Bond adventure, 007 First Light. Plus, Pearl Abyss’ expansive open-world action of Crimson Desert will be soaring onto consoles and PC in March as well. Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is looking to pick up where Rocksteady’s Arkham trilogy left off and infuse its satisfying melee combat with that indelible minifig charm when it launches on May 29. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But so much of 2026 remains uncertain — likely largely due to GTA shifting around more than James Brown did on stage in the ‘70s. Let’s start with some multiplatform games we are pretty confident are coming this year, before moving on to ones that will likely remain rooted in our dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Master Chief will soon be controlled by a DualSense. Halo: Campaign Evolved is heading to the PS5 in 2026 as Microsoft continues to unleash its library onto other platforms. This Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2001 Xbox classic could prove the spectre at the feast for Bungie, the original developers of Halo: Combat Evolved, if its own Marathon launch doesn’t go as planned.  At least it won’t be competing in the multiplayer market, as this new edition of Halo only includes the story campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra recently shifted out of its original window of early 2026 to “beyond early 2026”, so your guess is as good as mine as to when we’ll be playing Amy Hennig’s Captain America and Black Panther in World War 2 story. Legendary PlayStation hero Lara Croft will be returning in a “reimagining” of her original game, titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, and Finnish developer Remedy is back with another entry in its connected universe, Control: Resonant. Also announced at The Game Awards was the pleasantly surprising Star Wars: Galactic Racer from the makers of Burnout and Need For Speed that is scheduled to drop in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is also set for a big year outside of Resident Evil, with Onimusha: Way of the Sword and Pragmata both set to hit. As was the way in 2025, 2026 also looks set to keep you happy if you’re a fan of katanas and unnerving robots. As it will for vampire fans too, with The Blood of Dawnwalker looking really promising thanks to a non-linear narrative and sandbox-like structure, crafted by a team led by former Witcher 3 devs. Then there’s Mixtape, a game I’ve added to this list as one of my personally most anticipated of 2026. The sophomore project from The Artful Escape studio Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, this 80s-inspired coming-of-age adventure is definitely one to keep on your radar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is 2026 finally the year we get to play a new Ken Levine game? The Bioshock creator hasn’t given us one since 2013’s Infinite, and Judas has been in development for a <em>long </em>time now. Let’s hope this is the year, because it’s something I need in my life. As is The Witcher 4, but even I’m not foolish enough to believe that CD Projekt Red’s Ciri-led RPG is coming anytime soon. But feel free to surprise me. I’d love that. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hardware and Tech</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re not necessarily expecting any big hardware splashes this year, with the next console generations theoretically not due until late 2027 at the earliest. Sony tech wizard — and most importantly, creator of Knack — Mark Cerny did recently discuss new graphics capabilities in a conversation with AMD, which sparked PlayStation 6 speculation into overdrive, but it's still likely a couple of years away at least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumours are also abound of a new PlayStation handheld, after suggestions were made over the past summer that Sony could even be following Nintendo’s blueprint for the Switch, and turning the PS6 into a hybrid home and portable console. Of course, this is all just wild speculation, but with powerful hardware only reducing in size and cloud capabilities ever-growing, it doesn’t feel like too much of a stretch to imagine. As I said, though, we’re still quite a way off hearing anything concrete in regards to the future of PlayStation hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we know, along with a few guesses thrown in, about what to expect from PlayStation in 2026. What games are you most excited for this year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Yennefer you want.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> maker CD Projekt has a secret new expansion for its beloved role-playing game in the works, various reports have suggested. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Word that the studio was planning more content for its 2015 blockbuster originally dates back to a report published online last summer, in which Polish games industry insider Borys Nieśpielak first spilled details of the supposed project. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nieśpielak claimed that development was being handled by Fool's Theory — the studio that CD Projekt has also tasked with remaking The Witcher 1. Today, in a report by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, Nieśpielak doubled down on his initial claim and pointed to a recent hint by CD Projekt itself that the content was quietly in the works.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year," CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said in the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a>, published in November 2025. Without naming the content, Nielubowicz went on to suggest that it could have "an impact" on the company's upcoming results — potentially suggesting it would arrive relatively soon, and be relatively meaninful in scope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only official mention of an unnamed project, either. In a follow-up investor call following the aforementioned results, joint studio CEO Michał Nowakowski also made mention of an "other project" that Fool's Theory was working on, in the same breath as mentioning its The Witcher 1 remake and support for the upcoming The Witcher 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another whisper of the project came just before the end of last year from Polish analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski, who <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he expected "the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026." All of this points to CD Projekt, via Fool's Theory, having something new for The Witcher 3 fans in just a few months' time — an exciting prospect, and one that would make some sense. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As "full production" on The Witcher 4 continues, CD Projekt has cautioned fans not to expect its launch in 2026, as the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">plans an ambitious six-year roadmap in which it will also launch The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6</a>. Before all of that, there's a window this year for even more Witcher, and a fresh slice of content that could potentially help bridge the gap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new DLC feels like a smart idea to reawaken lapsed interest ahead of the series' next chapter, via extra content sold to The Witcher 3's existing audience of more than 60 million players. This content could be used as a reason to sell the game anew, to bring fresh fans to the decade-old role-player, and potentially set up plot points to be expanded upon in The Witcher 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, of course, it could offer fans one last oppurtunity to play as Geralt — before the franchise's next trilogy focuses on Ciri. So, one last adventure?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

              <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cave-time-feeling-safe-in-minecraft">first began playing&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> in 2010</a>, I instantly fell in love. In its early, simple form, it was essentially a Lego kit, but one where monsters came out at night. That combination of a freedom to build whatever I wanted, but also the need to find somewhere safe and secure to hide in the dark, was all-consuming for me, and for a while there I wanted to play nothing else. Of course, I drifted away, and over time it’s felt like it’s become someone else’s game, perhaps even the rest of the world’s game. Even as my son has gone through multiple phases of playing, I’ve not found myself motivated to reconnect. That is, until this winter holiday, when he insisted I join him in playing on the <a href="https://store.donutsmp.net/">Donut SMP</a>. And in doing so, I’ve discovered that original love all over again.</p> <p>At some point, for me <em>Minecraft</em> became about something other than digging for ores and building a lovely home. In those very early days (the game wasn’t officially released until November 2011), it was uncomplicated. The scope was infinite, but the approach was basic—again, think Lego. I spent an inordinate amount of time playing it, such that when I started dating my now-wife she was quickly introduced to the obsessive nature of the games player, bemused to learn I’d regularly stay up until 2 or 3 a.m. just to dig for diamonds and then attempt to escape from a cave of spiders. Then, I suppose a combination of burnout and the political misery in which the game became embroiled saw me move on.</p>

I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/markus-notch-persson-talks-minecraft">first interviewed Persson in November 2010</a>, when&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> had became a hot property through word-of-mouth and downloaded java files. Then, in March 2011 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-minecraft-creator-mojang">I sort of invited myself over to visit Mojang</a>, the fledgling developer Persson had created to continue the development of the game. A sweet Swedish guy who’d only just moved his business operations out of his mom’s basement, he’d made his first $10 million at this point, and the small team were literally moving into their first office when I arrived. The only exterior sign on the building was a torn sheet of file paper with “MojangAB” scrawled on it in green pen, taped to the inside of the door. Business developer Daniel Kaplan showed me around, at one point announcing, “This is the conference room,” as we entered a completely bare room but for an upturned cardboard box in one corner. “It still needs some work,” he added.</p>

 <p>While there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-notch-on-the-future-of-minecraft">I again interviewed Persson</a>, and again spoke to a very modest, very bemused man, who rather sweetly believed that the game had already sold more copies than it would after going gold later that year (it had sold about one million at that point, it’s now at well over 350 million). We got on well. It was a good time. I would go on to be one of Persson’s regular targets of online harassment when everything went bad.</p>

 <p>And it was not long after, in fact, that things started to sour. It’s tempting to pinpoint this to when Microsoft bought <em>Minecraft</em> for an astonishing $2.5 billion, with at least $2 billion of that going directly to Persson, in 2014. But Persson had been through a lot of personal tragedy from the end of 2011 onward, and his online behavior had already begun to shift. By 2014 GamerGate had started, and while Persson began as a decent voice against that movement, it didn’t last. Given that I repeatedly had Notch’s over one million Twitter followers sicced upon me, I felt the shift very personally. <em>Minecraft</em> began to stink of that, of Persson’s revolting comments against feminism and LGBTQ rights, and then his complete collapse into QAnon. By 2019 I kinda hated the game.</p>

 <p>I have this cursed object in my house, a totem of all this: a cardboard Steve head signed by Persson in early 2011. God knows if it’s valuable—it precedes any official Mojang merch having been made, instead created by some local Swedish company Persson had commissioned. It sits in the cupboard above the water tank, covered in dust, this peculiar emblem of that incredible time of optimistic joy for indie gaming.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656452"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656452">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Doing Donuts</h2> <p>Donut SMP is one of the most popular public “Survival MultiPlayer” servers <em>Minecraft </em>players can join, seeing a peak of nearly 46,000 players in the last 24 hours, where anyone can log in for free and start exploring its enormous world. It’s the creation of high-profile <em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DrDonutt">DrDonut</a> (known to his mom as Nate Filson), and offers players a space to build, craft, raid and, perhaps more than anything else, generate in-game income. An intricate in-game market where anyone can buy and sell resources and crafted items (and again, I stress, for free) encourages new players to start making money by selling the basic resources needed by the long-term super-rich players who can’t be bothered to mine them for themselves. Quickly, enterprising kids can start raking in cash, allowing them to buy coveted powerful tools in order to craft impressive bases, or more likely, start running their own farms to profit even further.</p>

 <p>Before the Christmas break, my 11-year-old son asked about getting a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>Realm. These are essentially rented spaces on a server that allow up to 10 people to simultaneously play in the same&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> world. It’s pretty cheap, so I said sure, and the boy began inviting his classmates to join him. And it was, for maybe three weeks, glorious! It was incredible to see these kids come together, building wonderful bases, designing amazing XP farms, and then cooperating on adventures for resources. Then, factions developed, people made “alliances” that were rapidly broken, betrayal was felt, and revenge was sought. Those wonderful bases would be sabotaged, even blown up by one child who felt aggrieved with the rest. One kid started killing the others indiscriminately and stealing their prized items. In-game anger became real-world anger, friendships were harmed at school, and eventually my son didn’t want to go back. It was too sad in there now. But, instead, he asked if it might be possible to join the server he had spent countless hours watching others play in on YouTube.</p> <p>It turns out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPbVIS5wL6A&amp;t=8s">joining servers on a Nintendo Switch</a> is no easy task. It involves editing DNS settings, then spoofing server access to force the console build of the game to let you enter server addresses, and the whole thing is fraught with crashing and errors. But, once figured out, the boy got in and immediately knew what he was doing. And given it was the holidays and I wasn’t chained to my desk, he asked if I would join him too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000656450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656450"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656450">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Farming joy</h2> <p>I was reluctant because, as I say, my relationship with <em>Minecraft</em> had become fraught. I’ve played with him in local multiplayer a bunch over the years, but it’s never really clicked for us; all I ever want to do is dig down and find diamonds, while he wants to do far more interesting and complicated things like farm skeletons or investigate other arcane mysteries. But here, in DonutSMP, our desires matched perfectly! To get started, we needed to make money, and to make money we needed someone to dig stupid amounts of resources, and someone who knew how to craft them into something worthwhile. Together we’re the perfect team!</p>

 <p>We now have the most extraordinary secret base, in which my son has figured out how to use redstone to build contraptions that automatically harvest sugarcane and cacti, then push them into channels of water that sort them into chests. And I really mean he figured it out—rather than following a guide, or copying a YouTuber, he somehow intuited the method of observers and pistons needed to automate all this. He informs me that he’s equally surprised at his own discovered skills. I randomly teleport away to try to gather some rails or cobwebs, while he deftly battles mobs that spawn above us and designs increasingly clever new machines. Then it’s his turn to explore great distances away where he inevitably finds something incredible like an ancient underground city, or the half-looted remains of another player’s base.</p> <p>Oh, and that’s the constant threat. DonutSMP is, ultimately, a hostile place. Funnily enough, in many ways it’s like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> in the sense of a PvE world that contains the constant threat of unexpected PvP. The 40,000 people playing are spread across so much space that it’s very unlikely to see someone else at any point—I never have—but you’ll see <em>signs</em> of other players&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em>. The ground often bears the scars of battles, or peculiar towers of blocks stretching impossibly into the sky, giving this sense of an abandoned world in which you’re scraping to survive, yet one constantly belied by the menu-based market in which other players greedily buy your stacks of iron bars or enchanted shears. (Seriously, no one copy me, but I’ve made a <em>fortune</em> selling Unbreaking III shears for ridiculous prices!) But all the time, we’re surrounded by the existential fear that another player might stumble upon our underground realm, most likely when we’re not playing, and take everything from us. Or perhaps even just wantonly vandalize our hours of labor. (Hence our location being blurred out in all the screenshots!)</p>

  <p>Those markets have also been the most extraordinary introduction to the perils and cruel machinations of capitalism for the boy. Seriously, this should be used in schools to explain the concept of supply and demand. There we are, bringing in $50,000 a stack for our piles of crafted rails, when some bastard gets on and starts listing the same for $15,000. What to do? Reduce our prices to compete? Wait until those bargain tracks are gone and hope the market recovers? Or, as I cannot resist, buying up everything the twerp is selling, then relisting it on the store at a sensible price. The speed with which it mimics (satirizes, even) the stock markets is chilling and hilarious.</p> <p>And through all of this, I’ve realized I’ve rediscovered that first love. Once again, there’s a purpose and a reason for me to dig down for diamonds, just now with the bonus ending of crafting pickaxes we can then enchant and sell for $150,000 to someone who can’t be bothered to make them for themselves. Between us, me and the boy have made <em>millions</em>, and perhaps far more importantly, we’ve had a brilliant time together in this equalizing environment during cold wintry mornings.</p> <p>Everything I loved about&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is relevant here, with that infinite possibility given a deeper, more resonant meaning through both the vulnerability and the sense of a shared space with the person I love most in the world. I can forget all that grimness of the mid-2010s and return to this splendid game in a way that feels meaningful, and rather more importantly, enormously fun. That weird Steve head sits sadly in the cupboard, this adumbration of a lost time, but it can be forgotten. I’ve got shears to enchant.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>It can be tempting, in an era where there are simply <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">way too many great games</a> coming out every month, to give into list inflation. Top 10s become top 25s. Top 25s become top 50s. By 2030, we might even see our first top 100 GOTY list. <em>Kotaku</em> has not been immune to the ebb and flow of year-end trends. <a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2022-elden-ring-god-war-ragnarok-marvel-1849934499">In 2022</a>, we slimmed our best game picks down to 10. <a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357">In 2024</a>, we went all the way up to 15. Each list was correct in its own way, but sometimes annual rituals draw their strength from embracing tradition rather than changing with the times.</p> <p>To that end, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s top games of 2025 list this year will go back to straddling the Goldilocks GOTY middle ground <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2015-1750944200">of 12 best games</a>. We are still ranking them and describing why each made the cut, but we have gone out of our way to limit ourselves to promoting what we feel are the best of the best. Lists are defined as much by what gets left off of them as anything else. Those painful sacrifices at the bottom of the cut-off are not in vain. They give the rest of the list its juice. So without further ado, here are<em> Kotaku</em>‘s best games of 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>12. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656427"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656427">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Games are partly defined by the actions they allow. Hand the controller to someone who rarely plays games and you’ll quickly see reasonable assumptions about exploration and play collide with the idiosyncratic limitations of games many of us take for granted. “Why can’t I go there? Why can’t I do this?” For decades, platformers have been oriented around moving through carefully calibrated environments. Fancy Rube Goldberg machines that nevertheless remains static under the hood.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> turns everything on its head with one simple transgression that has huge consequences: what if you could break stuff? It’s a question so bold, the game comes with a level reset button baked in because the possibilities are so chaotic you could very well wreck your playthrough. The results are endlessly rewarding though, letting you dig tunnels, stack bridges, and continually uncover secrets where most games are, by design, hellbent on never letting you go. The arsenal of power-ups Donkey Kong unlocks, combined with sprawling, freeform environments, leads to an uneven but irresistible sandbox that not only reinvigorates the franchise but breaks new ground in one of gaming’s oldest, most well-worn genres. <span>—</span>&nbsp;Ethan Gach</p>

 <hr> <h2>11. <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656177" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656177"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656177">Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Admittedly, I went into </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s Game of the Year discussions fully ready to let </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>fall off the list. But when we actually sat down, I was surprised that an actual argument for its placement just started flowing out of me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are always met with a barrage of criticism, both merited and unmerited, because Game Freak and The Pokémon Company are carrying the world’s biggest sack of cash on their back with the most profitable franchise in the world in their hands and still aren’t releasing games with the same level of scale and polish as other AAA games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, after the dust has settled and people look back on them, plenty of games that are met with harsh criticism upon release get a reassessment. So let’s skip to that part: </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is perhaps the most impressive, holistic reimagining the series has seen in probably all of its nearly 30 years.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span>’s focus on one city means that it lacks the typical “journey” that’s always been synonymous with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but Game Freak uses that smaller stage to home in on everything it’s done well in the Switch era. Its real-time battle system is one of the most transformative changes Game Freak has ever brought to these games, and while yes, there will always be a place for the series’ classic turn-based combat, I would love to see this approach become a foundation for not only </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>future </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games</span></a><span>, but also for a competitive scene that mixes timing, parrying, dodging, and more into its battles.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the battles, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doubles down on Game Freak’s recent dedication to narrative and character work, bringing together one of its most memorable casts of weirdos yet and letting you stick with them through the game’s entire run</span><span>. It’s a rich space for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>to get contemplative, examining everything it’s ever done in the name of catching ‘em all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is the result of a team let off the leash and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988"><span>looking to do something more than it’s been allowed</span></a><span> to do for decades. Like the game’s Urban Redevelopment plan meant to bring people and Pokémon together in harmony, it may just be another experiment in Game Freak’s journey to figuring out what the future of the franchise looks like, but I hope </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>turns out to be a more foundational moment for the next 30 years. Or at least a sign that more big swings like it are on the way. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <hr> <h2>10. <em>Battlefield 6</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656170"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656170">EA</figcaption></figure> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" data-msg-ts="1767119346.325529" data-msg-channel-id="D095XST8Q0G" id="message-list_1767119346.325529" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1767119346.325529"> <p>It had been far too long since a really good&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Battlefield&nbsp;</i>game. Thankfully,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic"><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</i>provided fans, myself included, with an incredible entry in EA’s online FPS series.&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">BF6&nbsp;</i>isn’t perfect, but nobody was asking for that. What we wanted was a modern military shooter that wasn’t as fast and silly as&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">CoD</i>, but not as slow and tactical as&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">ARMA</i>. And that’s what we got. Nice. <span>— </span>Zack Zwiezen</p> <hr> </div> <h2>9. <em>Blippo+</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656165">YACHT, Telefantasy Studios, Noble Robot</figcaption></figure> <p>In 2025, it started becoming harder to identify things created with generative AI on sight. The obvious tells such work used to contain became increasingly rare, and so we sometimes had to squint harder, had to do more research, to be sure that clip circulating on Bluesky of someone telling off ICE agents in a particularly satisfying way or tearfully reuniting with their dog was real, and not just footage fabricated purely to manipulate our emotions.</p> <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Blippo+&nbsp;</i>would have been an extraordinary game in any year, but it felt particularly resonant in this one because it’s just so exuberantly, unabashedly, undeniably human, a collaborative work made by very creative people. It’s lively and weird and smart and queer and hopeful. It’s also an innovative and exciting exercise in storytelling and worldbuilding. In&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Blippo+</i>, you watch the TV broadcasts of an alien planet whose slate of programming includes game shows, talk shows, science shows, sci-fi sitcoms, news programming, cooking shows, celebrity gossip shows, and so on. Through them, you experience a gradual process of discovery, learning more about this planet that’s both very similar to and very different from our own, and getting attached to the personalities who speak to you from beyond the galactic bend.</p>

 <p>As time passes, a story unfolds of an event that shakes Blippian culture to its core. The game has plenty to say about possibilities for change in our culture, too, and how technology and media can be tools of the status quo, or mechanisms for disruption and progress. It’s timely, unique, and terrifically entertaining. And I’m still sad that I don’t have any more episodes of&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Werf’s Tavern&nbsp;</i>to watch. <span>—</span> Carolyn Petit</p> <hr> <h2>8. <em>Avowed</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656169">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>It might not be the biggest open-world RPG ever made, but&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Avowed&nbsp;</i>is one of the best precisely because it excises so much of the usual fluff and gunk so often featured in these kinds of games and focuses on snappy action, fantastic writing, memorable companions, and excellent world-building. <span>— </span>Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>7. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656428"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656428">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The premise of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> sounds like a bizarre fan mod but in practice it’s one of the most satisfying, challenging, and inventive multiplayer action games around. It proves you don’t need loot grinds, battle passes, or branded crossovers to keep a live-service experience feeling fresh and compelling, and that procedurally-generated open-world dungeons can prove as tense, thrilling, and brutally surprising as the most bespoke MMO raids. <em>Nightreign</em> is not just a brilliant roguelike, it’s a blueprint for how co-op can fundamentally transform a familiar experience into something even greater. — </span>Ethan Gach</p>

 <hr> <h2>6. <em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000633740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633740"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633740">Embark</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a> is 2025’s shared joy, the <em>Helldivers 2</em> for the misanthropic crowd, and an extraction shooter in which acts of PvP have become sinful. And like most sins, a perverse pleasure for those who partake.</p> <p>It so deftly combines the best of a multiplayer survival shooter with loot-hunting horror, delivering this all in distinct chunks where visits to the above-ground world are limited to 20 minutes for even the bravest player. Inventory space is your most valuable resource, each square precious as you decide whether it’s worth filling with any of the seven trillion items that can be retrieved, weighing up weight and wait against the frantic dash for an exit.</p> <p>Few games are capable of offering the same constant sense of ass-curdling fear, of only&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">just</i>&nbsp;making it, and then the colossal sense of loss when failure eventually catches up with hubris.&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Arc Raiders</i> is a bite-sized game that you’ll play for entire banquets, compelling you to reach further, run farther, and risk more, just for the sake of incremental improvements and the all-consuming satisfaction of numbers going up. <span>— John Walker</span></p> <hr> <h2>5. <em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656176">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After </span><i><span>It Takes Two</span></i><span>, it’s surprising Hazelight hadn’t run out of ideas and was able to put together another co-op platformer filled to the brim with original, ever-evolving design ideas that make its dozen or so hours a synergetic joy to play with a friend, lover, or enemy you’re trying to learn to get along with. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i></a> <span>is the apex of Hazelight’s brand of cooperative design, using its blend of science fiction and fantasy settings to riff on different subgenres and finding a way to make each of them a concise, bite-sized game all on its own.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i><span>’s premise of a city cynic and a country bumpkin fighting their way through each other’s stories is pretty loose, though it does stumble (likely on accident) into some pertinent pro-artist, anti-AI sentiment. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in variety, and </span><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i><span>’s story does give the game’s shifting stage plenty of excuses to hand Mio and Zoe new toys to play with.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Split Fiction </span></i><span>is perhaps the most impressive version yet of the studio’s signature cooperative conventions, and if you had any doubt in the team’s ability to bring it all together, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868"><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i><span>’s final level</span></a><span> is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>sublime summation of everything</span></a><span> the game had been trying to convey. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <hr> <h2>4. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656175"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656175">Too Kyo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Too Kyo Games’ visual novel/strategy RPG hybrid remains one of 2025’s most impressive quiet success stories. The studio, helmed by the leads on both the </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Zero Escape </span></i><span>games</span><span>, went into debt to make </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792"><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a> <span>happen after nearly a decade of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><span>good but not groundbreaking efforts</span></a><span>, and was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150"><span>in danger of closing its doors</span></a><span> if the game didn’t pop off. A less bold developer could have played it safe and tried to create something simple and palatable for a wide audience, but </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is an incredibly bold Hail Mary that leaves it all on the line, and it’s one of the most impressive games of 2025 and of the visual novel genre because of it.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is a dense tribute to the genre, with 100 endings and dozens of routes that cover multiple visual novel staples, from zombie horror to a more tongue-in-cheek harem story, all within the confines of the war one group of high school students must fight with an incoming alien invasion. Though routes varies in quality, they are all, at least, baseline good and riff in some profound ways on the game’s core premise. The highs, however, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415"><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i></a> <span>lead Kazutaka Kodaka doing career-best work with his signature focus on characters caught between despair-inducing struggle and a logic-defying hope and belief in the good of even the worst of humanity.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these threads and timelines are held together by tactical battles that may not reach the same tour-de-force level as the game’s branching storylines, but do employ a rock solid puzzle-like system that uses its large cast of freaks and weirdos to great effect, giving them each singular battle styles that reveal just as much about these high schoolers locked in war as any branching timeline might.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s a dense tome of hope, despair, absurdity, and mystery that can be hard to recommend to the average person, the developers’</span><span> ambition of creating one of the largest visual novels ever, with dozens of routes spanning multiple genres all while funneling into the core mystery, is so bold it demands respect. But perhaps the most admirable part about it is that Too Kyo Games actually pulled it off. Having a bold idea that you even attempt to put on a Switch cartridge can get you pretty far, but </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>didn’t just try to become one of the most ambitious games of its genre.

A lot, actually, With so much of the industry rallying around Sandfall Interactive’s RPG as one of the defining games of the year, it sometimes feels like the game itself has become an almost untouchable symbol of what video games can </span><span>still </span><span>be despite the ever-encroaching dangers of slop and live-service money and time sinks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Right now, it feels like everyone is hanging their hopes and hatreds on </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, to the point where </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people"><span>falsehoods that support the narrative</span></a><span> have become far more prevalent than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590"><span>what actually got us here</span></a><span>.

 <p><span>All of these lovingly crafted systems and stories are coming from a debut game by a new studio full of industry talent that had become dissatisfied at the big studios where they previously worked, and it’s already being mentioned in conversations alongside genre staples like </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span>, and…oops. Maybe I’m susceptible to The Narrative, too. It is a juicy one. A team of talented developers, writers, and artists who left big publishers like Ubisoft to do their own thing, making games that look like the big-budget efforts people still want but without the meddling of a publisher trying to inject some live-service grind into them, and being rewarded with success and acclaim does feel like the antidote to problems plaguing the industry. If nothing else, perhaps it’s a sign that more games like it are possible, and if we do get more such games, then perhaps this one will become less of a golden idol for a community looking for proof that the industry’s future isn’t as bleak as it once felt, and it can finally be appreciated solely based on what a stunning debut it is. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-ai-in-gaming-will-only-get-worse-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 has seen AI dominate various forms of media, leading to a significant impact across the entire spectrum of the world, including the gaming industry. However, this is merely the tip of the iceberg, and the impact is likely to intensify in 2026.</p>



<p>The past 12 months have seen AI become increasingly prominent in gaming, ranging from additions like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-faces-unfair-labor-practice-charge-for-use-of-ai-darth-vader-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-voiced Darth Vader in For</a>tnite to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully AI-generated game</a>, with a smattering of other controversies in between.</p>



<p>While these incidents have sparked discussions at various points of the year, 2025 is set to be only a drop in the ocean for AI in video games, and a huge crossroads lurks ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-major-turning-point">A Major Turning Point</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Controversial. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to remember that AI in video games isn’t anything new, and the fact of the matter is, games would simply not be able to run without some AI. All of the enemy soldiers you defeat in a Call of Duty campaign, the opponents you come up against in single-player in EA FC 26, and the NPCs you meet across the vast worlds require AI, in some capacity, to work.</p>



<p>The turning point, however, has been how AI is being used. Rather than using AI to support human-created elements, that step is being skipped in many cases to reduce the workload and have AI do the creation, where it’s artwork to coding. While it’s a crucial tool that can help prevent crunch at studios, controversy remains about its use and whether it will ultimately cost people their jobs.</p>



<p>Using AI as a replacement for human work has been problematic, and gamers have a keen eye to spot where AI has been used, particularly in artwork, with accusations cast towards a slew of major games for certain aspects of work published in 2025.</p>



<p>The discovery of AI use in 2025 has led to backlash, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game Awards disqualifying Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for generative AI usage and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">Battlefield 6 coming und</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">er</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/"> fire</a> for suspected use of AI in cosmetic items, and the big question now is how long that furore will last.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-backlash-ease">Will The Backlash Ease?</h2>



<p>Heading into 2026, using AI, particularly generative AI, is somewhat of a death note, as it’s certain to cause backlash among gamers, and there’s no hiding any usage, as players don their detective gear to uncover the truth of whether AI has been used in assets. Essentially, it’s a PR nightmare.</p>



<p>What’s unclear is whether that backlash will remain, as the growing use of AI may eventually be the norm, rightly or wrongly. When used in the right way to support developers and ease tasks, AI is a handy tool, but it’s hard to look across the wealth of layoffs in the industry in recent years and see higher-ups not viewing AI as a handy cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>This isn’t restricted to gaming, as the use of AI has attracted huge criticism in all forms of media, while it also has both environmental and political impacts. For now, the general view of AI is a negative one, but don’t be surprised if millions upon millions is splashed to try and alter public opinion.</p>



<p>AI use is not a problem unique to gaming, but the future does look bleak, particularly for those employed in a creative industry. Unfortunately, there are no signs of the problem going away, and 2026 could be the stage for a major shift.</p>

<p>"Dare to peek into the darkness"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9fc5b88a3b048"><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fc5b88a3b048/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has become really bloomin' prolific in recent years, having released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and a Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear</a> in 2025, with none other than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> the year prior. It's currently hard at work on a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> with Konami alongside an original title simply called '<strong>Project M</strong>' for the time being for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's entirely possible that Project M is the focus of a new tease from Bloober Team, with the studio launching a new website featuring a countdown timer. The timer runs out on <strong>15th February</strong> and, according to our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/industrious-horror-dev-bloober-team-teases-potential-new-project">Push Square</a>, there are no hints towards anything Konami-related in the website's source code (and yes, we double-checked ourselves too, <em>just to be safe</em>).</p>
<p>The website itself is titled <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd.com</a>, which means... something..? It's all rather vague at the moment – deliberately so, no doubt. A social media post linking to the site also states "Dare to peek into the darkness.." So at the very least, it seems to be leaning heavily on Bloober's penchant for horror.</p>

<p>If this is indeed related to Project M, which is being published by Bloober's own subsidiary Broken Mirror Games, then there should be plenty to get excited about. The studio's CEO Piotr Babieno <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/horror-dev-bloober-team-on-its-new-exclusive-this-is-a-vision-that-could-only-exist-on-nintendo-hardware">recently stated</a> that the project is particularly geared toward "fans of <strong>Resident Evil</strong>, <strong>Silent Hill</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/limbo">Limbo</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>", while being a vision that could "only exist on Nintendo hardware".</p>
<p>Curious, indeed. We'll be keeping a close eye on this as we inch toward 15th February, and we'll let you know if we hear anything new as soon as possible.</p>

Don’t Google it if you’re on a work computer because the image results might get you in trouble, but </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, HBO Max’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-book-watch-cast-hockey-2000649249"><span>gay hockey romance</span></a><span>, revealed to me that a lot of people don’t know what that word means, and it was only when the hockey-playing twinks performed this sexual act on an episode of the show that some people were made aware that there was an actual word for two men rubbing their dicks together that wasn’t some joke like “sword fighting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a gay man who has a lot of straight friends, a not-insignificant part of my longest friendships has been basically acting as a sex ed teacher for men who don’t know what sex looks like when the people involved have the same hardware. Now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-episodes-book-gq-ratings-2000655368"><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has become such a cultural phenomenon</span></a><span> that it’s bridging the gap, especially for those who are mostly interested in the hockey side of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3mba5dhe2bc2h"><i><span>Empty Netters</span></i></a><span> is a hockey podcast, and naturally when one of the biggest shows on streaming is about hockey players who also are knocking around sticks of a different kind, the hosts have gotta take advantage of the moment and cover the show. Hearing a group of straight men unpack the logistics of gay sex, such as roles like top, bottom, and versatile, and just being genuinely fascinated and non-judgmental, is easily a best-case scenario from fans of a sport that has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/opinions/nhl-pride-tape-ban-coming-out-day-de-la-cretaz"><span>its history of homophobia</span></a><span>.

Eventually, however, they end up in the same city, and then they have at it. It’s all presented with so much tension and drama that everyone watching the show, even straight men, are rooting for them to get it together and be more than a secret romance. There’s also a second couple with a similar struggle that gets its own dedicated episode, and seeing them finally reconcile is one of the few moments of unabashed catharsis the show, whose central couple is trapped in a will they/won’t they dynamic, has delivered. And it’s got straight men crying! Me too, brother.</span></p>         <p><span>Unfortunately, it’s not all positivity.

            <title><![CDATA[We’re Already Getting Our First Gaming Price Hike Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448</link>
            <guid>1396015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus has cracked the seal on price hikes just ahead of CES 2026. The electronics maker, which is responsible for a range of PC gaming hardware including the already $1,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, warned partners of “strategic price adjustments” for certain products starting January 5.</p> <p>The company didn’t specify which products would get more expensive or by how much, but it did blame the current AI arms race for the upwards pressure on pricing. “These changes reflect shifts in capacity allocation by upstream suppliers, higher investment costs for advanced manufacturing processes, and structural supply gaps created by rising AI compute demand,” executive Liao Yi-Xiang wrote in a December 30 letter that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-officially-announces-price-hikes-from-january-5-right-before-ces-2026">translated by <em>Videocardz</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The company directly points to DRAM, NAND, and SSD component shortages as part of the issue. The announcement comes just days ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas where Asus and other hardware manufacturers will be revealing new hardware updates and other tech products.</p>

 <h2>Gaming shortages, price hikes, and next-gen console delays</h2> <p>Asus’ warning is the first hard evidence that 2026 will continue to see gaming get more expensive across the spectrum as major tech firms pivot to supplying ever-increasing demands for generative AI compute capacity. There were rumors throughout the end of 2025 that AMD and other companies were going to face shortages, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">s</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">ome hardware insiders</a> claiming that Microsoft’s Xbox would be among the hardest hit due to poor inventory management.</p>

 <p>According to<em> Insider Gaming</em>, the problem has gotten so bad that some hardware manufacturers are already discussing potential delays to next-gen hardware launches like the PlayStation 6 and new Xbox. “The situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, thereby allowing prices to drop,” it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/">reported last month</a>.</p>

 <p>More recently, <a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">South Korea outlet <em>Newsis</em> reported</a> that Nvidia and AMD are already looking at significantly increasing GPU prices in 2026. The most eye-popping claim was that graphics cards like the $2,000 RTX 5090 could more than double in price to $5,000 by the end of the year. But even much smaller price increases of just a few hundred dollars would make PC gaming’s current affordability crisis continue to spiral out of control.</p>

 <p>Whatever the short-term impact on pricing for gaming components, the AI race has already remade companies like Microsoft and Nvidia, to the point where their non-AI business appears as a relative rounding error on the larger enterprise’s P&amp;L. Without a complete implosion of the gen AI market (never say never), <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332">it’s hard to see that changing any time soon</a>.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Four scouts on an end-of-year trip, flying across the world for what should be a life-changing experience. What could go wrong? An engine malfunction. The squad crash-lands somewhere in the Pacific. They’re the only survivors on a mysterious island that only grows stranger the deeper they venture and the longer they stay. This is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-players-are-passing-time-at-the-airport-in-increasingly-elaborate-ways/1100-6535123/" data-ref-id="1100-6535123">Peak</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Sound familiar? The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way. The mystery only grows--in both depth and complexity--the further you get, whether you’re marathoning episodes or climbing up a volcano in search of rescue.</p><p dir="ltr">Lost worked because of that mystery. A group that crash-landed on an isolated island runs into underground bunkers, hidden groups of strangers, and a smoke monster as they try to survive and find their way home. Every new discovery widens the gap between what you think you understand and what’s actually happening.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625304-3527290_193.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625304" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625304-3527290_193.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625304"></a><figcaption>What's the meaning behind the temple steps in Caldera?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625304-3527290_193.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Peak finds some of its own success through that same sense of the unknown. Underground tombs, undead scoutmasters, and magical items that bend the rules of time and space make the mountain feel twisted and storied. The simplicity of the climb draws you in, but it’s the mystery--hidden behind statues, items, and the strange mechanics of Peak--that makes you want to stay on that island. Even if it’s only because your body was never found.</p><p dir="ltr">One anonymous member of the Lost writing staff said the team would sometimes toss around whatever <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/03/25/lost-season-1-former-writer-behind-the-scenes-essay/77578662/" rel="nofollow ">odd or surprising twist came to mind</a> and add it in without stressing too much about how it might wrap up later. They admitted they knew they were essentially messing with the audience, but for six seasons, it worked--although there are some wide-ranging opinions about how the story ultimately wrapped up.</p><p dir="ltr">Not having to pay things off later, while definitely a hindrance, helped the mystery of Lost deepen in so many ways. The fact that it became a sensation--finding its way into the homes of millions--made that mystery even thicker in the air of everyday life.</p><p dir="ltr">While Peak was originally meant to be part of a project to bring its developers a simpler, commercially viable product, its development story has followed a surprisingly similar path since launch. Peak was something Aggro Crab and Landfall planned to make and then move on from. They didn’t have a detailed content roadmap for the future. But once the game launched--and a million copies were sold in a matter of days--the need for a plan for post-launch content became suddenly, overwhelmingly obvious.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625305-3527290_167.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625305-3527290_167.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625305"></a><figcaption>Who is BingBong?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625305-3527290_167.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The result is magical underground tombs containing idols that protect scouts from freezing weather and scalding lava, a book that removes your skin and internal organs, and a strange pair of eyes staring at you from behind a distant rock.</p><p dir="ltr">Even something as simple as the Looker--a mysterious scout who watches from a distance before vanishing--adds another layer to the island’s mystery. Who is this scout? How have they survived here? This small feature--one that can be turned off in the settings--raises even more questions as you make your way up the climb.</p><p dir="ltr">These elements makes the climb in Peak more enjoyable, while building a world that never quite connects in a logical way. It’s tantalizing to think everything players have experienced so far might be part of some sinister ritual, or that the scouts are already dead, as fan theories keep postulating. The climb--and the peak--might just be an eerie passageway to the afterlife.</p><p dir="ltr">Nobody knows for sure, but with Peak continuing to expand for at least the foreseeable future with more and more updates, just like Lost's writers, the creators of Peak have a chance to keep building on those mysteries. Hopefully they'll also come up with a satisfying conclusion along the way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft’s CEO Wants People to Stop Calling AI ‘Slop’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-ai-slop/</link>
            <guid>1395973</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella has taken up a spot of blogging to share his thoughts on advances in technology, specifically around AI.</p>







<p>In a new blogpost posted to his new website named ‘<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snscratchpad</a>‘, Nadella remarks that 2026 will be a “pivotal year for AI,” noting, “Yes, another one [year]. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.”</p>



<p>According to Nadella, “We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion. We are beginning to distinguish between “spectacle” and “substance”. We now have a clearer sense of where the tech is headed, but also the harder and more important question of how to shape its impact on the world.”</p>



<p>“We are still in the opening miles of a marathon. Much remains unpredictable. Amidst this “model overhang,” where capability is outpacing our current ability to use it to have real world impact, this is some of what we still need to get right,” he continued.</p>



<p>In point one, Nadella states that “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”</p>



<p>He later continues to say that “we need to make deliberate choices on how we diffuse this technology in the world as a solution to the challenges of people and planet. For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact. The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”</p>



<p>While true, it isn’t at all surprising to see Nadella fully in support of AI, after all, Microsoft has seen tens of thousands of layoffs in the past 36 months as the company continues to invest in AI.</p>







<p>Even now, it’s almost impossible to use any of Microsoft’s ecosystem without having some form of AI use, with Microsoft Copilot being at the forefront of the company’s drive.</p>



<p>It’s certainly looking like 2026 will be another year focused on AI, but with new issues coming to the forefront, including an unprecedented rise in RAM prices and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/">hardware including GPUs</a>, it poses the question to what extent will AI be pushed and the price that we’ll, quiter literally, have to pay.</p>

			<p>Although modern video games can sometimes be too easy, some players still manage to find a challenge in them by performing extreme feats of mastery that attract the utmost admiration from each game's community.</p>



<p>Despite being a turn-based role-playing game where such feats often boil down to build-perfecting and long hours of grinding, with its parry mechanics, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong> allows for some masterful play that can enable underleveled characters with an unoptimized build to defeat some of the most powerful bosses in the game... <strong>pulling an 8-hour shift.</strong></p>



<p>On the game's <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official subreddit Expedition 33</a></strong>, user <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Recordbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recordbreaks</a></strong> proved their name is no joke by sharing a screenshot of the result screen after their battle against the <strong>Duolliste Boss</strong>, the most difficult boss fight added to the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/"><strong>Thank You Update released for free last month.</strong></a></p>



<p>The numbers on the screenshot speak for themselves. <strong>Recordbreaks</strong> defeated the powerful boss in <strong>8:02:36 minutes</strong>, successfully <strong>parrying 10,545 times</strong> over the boss's two phases, a feat that is made even more impressive not only by the boss's moveset featuring some <strong>unnatural parry timings</strong> meant to throw players off but also by the <strong>huge pressure</strong> this player will have felt during the gruelling 8 hours spent fighting this boss.</p>

            <guid>1395955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The TTRPG community has lost one of its pioneers. Tim Kask, a man who would shape the earliest version of the iconic TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and the first full-time employee of TSR Inc., has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Tim Kask</h2><p>The influence Tim Kask had on the tabletop industry is substantial. He was an avid wargamer, playing many tactical war games in the 1970s. Eventually, he had a chance to play <em>Chainmail</em>, designed by Gary Gygax.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tim-kask-black-and-white-gaming-table-photo.jpg?itok=3tCXBIPs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="489">

  </picture><p>This experience led to the two men corresponding about miniature game rules, which led to Kask being invited to Gen Con to playtest Gygax's next game: <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Kask was the first playtester outside of Gygax's family to play this version, originally called "The Fantasy Game."&nbsp;</p><p>This relationship deepened when Tim Kask was hired full-time by Gygax's company, TSR Inc., in 1975. He edited and contributed to various <em>D&amp;D</em> supplements, such as the influential and genre-blending <em>Blackmoor</em> setting and <em>Eldritch Wizardry</em>, which introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-refines-new-psychic-casting-class" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">psionics</a> and Mind Flayers to the game. There is even a device in the game named after a character he made: the Apparatus of Kwalish.</p><p>Kask was also known for periodical work. One of his biggest contributions was as editor for the TSR magazine, <em>The Strategic Review</em>, which would eventually split into two different books: <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and <em>Little Wars</em>. <em>Dragon Magazine</em> is vital since it introduced ideas, spells, and magic items that would appear in official <em>D&amp;D</em> products.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those ideas is the now iconic Forgotten Realms setting. The same setting that has hosted many epic and beloved D&amp;D adventures, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><p>Tim Kask would depart from TSR in 1980. The reason for his departure was creative disagreement around the creation of <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. According to <a href="https://gamerant.com/tim-kask-dungeons-and-dragons-editor-death/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Rant's</a> findings, Kask thought original <em>D&amp;D</em> should stay, "a free-wheeling game" and didn't like the new rules-focused approach.</p><p>But Kask didn't completely vanish from the tabletop community. He would appear at conventions and continue writing and developing in the industry. His most recent work was the founding of Eldritch Enterprises in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Kask passed away on December 30, 2026, after a sudden illness. He passed peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by friends and family.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Will we ever get a new <em>Deus Ex</em>? Could Ascend be the mechanical centerpiece of the next <em>Zelda</em>? And can speedrunning wash away all the bad sulfates still swimming around in our systems <a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-review-ea-gaza-microsoft-trump-2000656422">from 2025</a>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, brought to you from my in-laws’ basement in western PA where the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3mbhb6xyphs2v">wind chill has temps near zero</a>. I’m currently blogging with an original Xbox to my right and the Sega Genesis version of <em>Shaq Fu</em> to my left. I am trying to put the finishing touches on my January backlog plans. They include getting at least one of the Celestial weapons in <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p> <h2>The most obnoxious way to beat an ultra-hard <em>Clair Obscur</em> boss</h2> <p>It took Reddit user&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/recordbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">Recordbreaks</a> 10,545 successful parries to beat the RPG’s new Duolistest boss from the recent free update, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fan-wins-ridiculous-8-hour-boss-battle-with-10545-successful-parries-and-no-dodges"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. The whole thing took over eight hours to complete, including one short break.</p> <p>“Only reason it took me this long is because I haven’t properly built Verso for damage in the millions yet,” Recordbreaks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pynsh7/if_it_can_bleed_it_can_die/">wrote</a>. “He was doing maybe 200,000 damage per hit and that’s if Roulette was working in my favor which it wasn’t most of the time.”</p>

 <h2>Don’t expect a new <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2026</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">….no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths.</p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The voice of Adam Jensen, Elias Toufexis, <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057">recently previewed</a> his upcoming projects for 2026, including three mystery games. “No <em>Deus Ex</em> because the people in charge are psychopaths,” he added to cut off fan speculation. A new game in the sci-fi franchise was r<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/embracer-lays-off-97-people-at-eidos-montreal-reportedly-cancels-new-deus-ex-game/">eportedly cancelled</a> back in 2024 amid a wave of layoffs at Eidos Montreal.</p>

 <h2>A neat idea for the next <em>Zelda</em> game</h2> <p><em>Xboxera</em> cofounder Nick&nbsp;‘Shpeshal Nick’ Baker shared an alleged rumor about the next mainline <em>Zelda</em> game for Switch 2 on a <a href="https://youtu.be/CI8dpwlLOB4?t=4937">recent crossover podcast</a> with <em>Giant Bomb</em>‘s Jeff Grubb. Whether it’s accurate or not (I’m prone to disbelieve any Nintendo-related rumor unless it’s a multi-sourced report or comes from a supply chain warehouse), it still makes for a neat concept.</p>

 <p>Baker suggests the next <em>Zelda</em> will revolve around dimensional shifting using tears to transport between worlds. The mechanic would impact puzzle solving and other parts of the game, which would carry over a lot of the open-world concepts from <em>BotW</em> and <em>TotK</em>. It might be fan fiction, but it would also make for a neat-sounding game.</p>

 <p>I can totally imagine Nintendo taking the Ascend ability from the last game, which began life <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-ascend-cheat-code-escape-dungeon-1850432148">essentially as a development cheat code</a>, and creating a whole game around it. Whatever the next <em>Zelda</em> ends up being, it’s probably still years away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The next year is shaping up to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 including a wealth of major releases from huge publishers across the world, but there are also plenty of exciting Indie releases on the horizon.</p>



<p>From sequels to popular titles to entirely new creations, Insider Gaming has selected eight of the biggest Indie games to watch out for in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-2026-indie-releases">Biggest 2026 Indie Releases</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where else is there to start? After being scrapped by Riot Games, Hytale is back in the hands of it’s original creators at Hypixel Studios and an early access release is set for January 13. After a long, long wait, this could be one of the biggest releases of the year.</p>



<p>Hytale began life as a Minecraft server, and the inspiration from the Mojang title is clear to see, but the big differences are the embracement of modding, with all in-game assets being made available to the community to create with, opening the door to an infinite number of ideas.</p>



<p>The early access release merely marks the next stage in the Hytale journey, and players have been warned it’s far from the finished product, but, either way, Hytale will be huge in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-demon-tides">Demon Tides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Washout. Image via Fabraz</figcaption></figure>



<p>A platformer set in the open seas, Demon Tides will see players explore the waters of the world to uncover dark secrets, with “dozens of locales” and gear to upgrade, and the game is set to be released on February 19.</p>



<p>The demo, initially released in February 2025, earned rave reviews, and even received an update dropping additional content, and the full adventure is now right around the corner.</p>



<h3 id="h-beastro">Beastro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Cooking up a storm. Image via Timberline Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>No release date has been set for Beastro, but a demo is now available on Steam, with the title seeing players take control of Panko, tasked with creating culinary masterpieces to serve to a variety of characters, and the dishes you create will build a deck for their adventures.</p>



<p>The food-based fantasy adventure’s unique mix of cooking and deck building, with a variety of ingredients to unlock and secrets to discover, will certainly cause a stir, and it’s a title you should definitely keep your eyes peeled for in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-aniimo">Aniimo</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Journey awaits. Image via Pawprint Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two years after Palworld set the gaming world alight, a new open-world, creature-catching game is on the horizon with Aniimo, which, like the Pocketpair title, will be open to a wide audience due to its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass from release date. </p>



<p>Full details of the release are yet to be shared, though they could come in Xbox’s Partner Showcase in January, but the countdown is well and truly on, with reveals showcasing an array of Aniimo’s to collect, vast social interactions, and an exciting world to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set for launch in March 2026, Slay the Spire 2 is the sequel to the original title, once again inciting players with a roguelike deckbuilder filled with challenges and variety.</p>



<p>The original Slay the Spire, released in 2019, is still extremely popular to this day and is ranked overwhelmingly positive on Steam with close to 70,000 reviews, showing that there is already an extremely strong playerbase, and more players are set to be drawn in.</p>



<h3 id="h-coromon-rogue-planet">Coromon: Rogue Planet</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Going rogue. Image via TRAGsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another creature-catching game releasing in 2026 is Coromon: Rogue Planet, a sequel to the original Coromon, which focuses on a roguelike approach—which could set it apart from other games in the genre.</p>



<p>While there’s plenty that will be familiar to players, like choosing your starter Coromon and battling wild monsters, the roguelike approach gives a different spin to the game, and could lure in a heap of players as a result.</p>

<p>The creators of Untitled Goose Game are back in 2026 with the release of Big Walk, a cooperative online walker-talker where players can “hang out and get lost with close friends in a big world.”</p>



<p>Filled with challenges, puzzles and discoveries, there’s a heap of adventures on the horizon, and the scope to just hang out with your friends, or boot your companions into the ocean, the choice is up to you.</p>

<p>Neverway is described as a mixture of a horror, life sim, and action RPG, where players take charge of Fiona, who starts over on a farm. If this sounds like your cup of tea, and you’re a big fan of Stardew Valley, Neverway’s release in 2026 is something that can’t be missed.</p>



<p>With farming, combat, dating, and plenty to collect, Neverway could be one of the biggest titles in 2026, and the fact it was co-created by the pixel artist of Celeste adds another feather into Neverway’s cap.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Jailbreak Rumors Have Caused A Star Wars Game to Increase 1000% in Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-game-hike-in-price/</link>
            <guid>1395940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new PlayStation 5 rumour suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console can be jailbroken</a> has caused one Star Wars game to increase in price by over 1000%.</p>







<p>That’s because, according to the rumours, the jailbreak method can only be done with a physical version of one particular game.</p>



<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, which, before the rumours, was selling for around $50. Now, listings on eBay are as high as $500, meaning that the price has increased tenfold.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gezine</a> on X, one of the reasons for the sudden price increase is that the game only has around 10,000 copies in the market, which is a relatively low number in the grand scheme of things. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Racer Revenge [Full Game | No Commentary] PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7TXXOtvIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As of yet, Star Wars Racer Revenge is the only game that works and according to the rumours, it works because the exploit targets the PlayStation 5’s disc authentication used for backwards compatibility.</p>



<p>Sony is yet to respond to the rumours, but if true, the jailbreaks could pose security concerns for the brand. As for what it currently means for jailbroken PlsyStation 5’s is also unclear, but it’s a step in the direction to soon having jailbroken consoles flooding the market.</p>







<div><p>So, with the price increases, it might be worth checking your library of physical games to see if you have a copy lying around. You might just be sitting on a fortune!</p><p>What do you think of the news that the PlayStation 5 may be jailbroken?

            <p>Time flies (like a Javelin suit): there are only 10 days left to play BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer game Anthem before the servers are switched off, presumably forever.</p>
<p>We've had this end-date in the diary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">since EA announced it last summer</a>. "After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," the company said. That day seemed far away then; now, it does not.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether there'll be a 'switching off event' of any kind. I'm trying to find out.</p>

<p>Because Anthem is an online multiplayer game, once EA switches the servers off, you won't be able to play it, regardless of if you own it or not. This is an aspect of modern live service gaming many people are frustrated by - this disappearance of games they bought but can no longer play. It's led to movements like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-offshoot-confident-eu-petition-will-progress-to-legislative-phase-with-almost-half-of-signatures-now-verified">Stop Destroying Games and Stop Killing Games, which are petitioning governments</a> in the hope of putting protections in place to stop this happening.</p><p>But if a game is not attracting a large enough audience to justify the expenditure of ongoing server costs, which I don't think Anthem was, then what's a company to do - run it at a loss? Or does it release the code to the community to host servers themselves? I'm sure the latter option is not as straightforward as it sounds.</p>

<p>Regardless, Anthem's end seems symbolic in the story of BioWare - a company famed for single-player role-playing experiences that was encouraged and perhaps pressured to make a huge bet on a multiplayer game that didn't work out. It was, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">as one of the key people involved in the project once told me</a>, a "dichotomy" - a game that tried to be two things (a BioWare experience and a multiplayer game) but ended up being neither. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli called Anthem a game "shaken apart by its own identity crisis" in Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>
<p>There were plans to overhaul Anthem - ambitious plans for a 2.0 reboot that would revitalise the experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-work-on-major-anthem-overhaul-has-officially-ceased">but these were eventually abandoned</a>.</p>
<p>Anthem's misfortunes in 2019 piled onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>'s misfortunes from 2017, leaving BioWare in a precarious and pressurised position after the relative high-point of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> in 2014. The eventual release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> in 2024, after 10 years of topsy turvy development - which included a few years as a multiplayer game - did nothing to remedy this.</p><p>All eyes now turn to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-midst-of-eas-controversial-acquisition-bioware-moves-to-reassure-fans-that-a-new-mass-effect-is-definitely-still-in-development">the elusive in-development fifth Mass Effect game</a>, the success of which BioWare's existence may hinge upon. Then again, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA's sports-focused Saudi Arabian acquisition</a> drawing nearer to completion, there's no telling what may happen and what the new owners may want.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studio-dispatch-over-3-million-copies-sold/</link>
            <guid>1395925</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We're officially in 2026 at the time of this writing, and everyone across the world is simultaneously looking back at the year that was and ahead at what's to come. For Dispatch developer <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong>, that reflection took the form of a highlight reel showing off several in-game statistics about how active players have been in their debut game, and capping the video by announcing the game had sold <strong>over 3 million copies</strong> since launch.</p>



<p><strong><em>Warning! Spoilers for Dispatch to follow.</em></strong></p>



<p>The video was shared <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/2006757644250337294">across the studio's official social media accounts</a>, thanking players who dove in and dispatched <strong>over 1 billion heroes</strong> over the course of <strong>52.5 million completed shifts</strong> and <strong>727 million distress calls</strong> answered. It also included a few stats based on the choices players made, including 2.8 million players choosing to cut Coupe from Z-Team, and 1.6 million choosing Sonar.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 2.3 million players added Waterboy to the team, and 2 million added Phenomaman. Perhaps the more significant stat regarding the game's story was the fact that 2.4 million players chose to keep Invisigal on the team, while 1.1 million of them cut her. Invisigal was also the character that more Dispatch players romanced over Blonde Blazer by a margin of 0.9 million, while 164K players stayed single and didn't romance anyone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ahead of the final stat (the over 3 million players), another key figure that popped up was the fact that people watched over 23 million hours of Dispatch-related content on YouTube and Twitch. Copies sold are one thing, but it's also incredibly significant in today's day and age to have a game with that much virality to it.</p>



<p>All together, it's clear that Dispatch has been an incredibly successful return <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-telltale-devs-the-wolf-among-us-2-adhoc-dispatch/">for the former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio</a>. The game is currently not available on subscription services like PS Plus or Xbox Game Pass (it's not even out on Xbox yet), so those 'over 3 million dispatchers' the video lists each represent a copy of Dispatch sold. A huge achivement for any game, let alone one with an entirely narrative-over-gameplay focus.</p>



<p>Dispatch was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/">Wccftech's Best Adventure games of 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our Best Games overall</a>. Hopefully, this level of quality not only continues, but improves as AdHoc Studio moves towards its next project, whether that's more episodes of Dispatch or something else entirely. In any case, the game is due to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">another injection of players when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 on January 29, 2026</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, the one question on your mind right now if you're a <em>Dragon Quest </em>fan is probably whether Square Enix is planning to reveal more information about the long-awaited next installment in the series, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p><p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2021, at which point it had been four years since <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-elusive-age" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5650383-7871-4d7a-8a57-bdc9e6ca76fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the previous mainline entry</a>. Since then, almost five more years have gone by, so <em>Dragon Quest </em>fans have been waiting a very long time indeed for news of the series' future.</p><p>Naturally, <em>Dragon Quest </em>hasn't been dormant in the intervening time. A plethora of spinoffs have been released, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="479f5a9f-55ff-465f-b449-c352aa8c3839" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">number of remakes</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-path" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d0dabe5-f32a-49c5-9804-b2d6bd5aac52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">previous games in the series</a>. Another remake, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, is scheduled to arrive next month.</p><p>If you're somehow not familiar with <em>Dragon Quest</em>, it's a series of rather cozy JRPGs that revolve around traditional turn-based gameplay, overworld exploration, and dungeon-delving. It's very much the comfort food of the JRPG world (and I say that as a compliment).</p>
<p>Despite that reputation, series producer Yuji Horii has <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/05/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-announced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">promised</a> an overhaul for the twelfth installment, pledging to shake up <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s combat and introduce "dark, mature content" to the franchise. We'll have to wait and see if he and Square Enix make good on these promises.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is officially over. Well, the main series, anyway. Netflix is still putting out the animated midquel series </span><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ’85</span></i><span> later this year. But the decade-long wait for an ending for the Hawkins kids is finally over. To some, the series finale seems to have gone over pretty alright. People in my group chat called it “fine,” another said they “absolutely crushed” it, and another remarked that they “did the best with what they had.” Those are reactions in private, rather than ones said publicly to get social media engagement, so I wasn’t surprised when I looked elsewhere and saw people were raking this episode through the coals.</span></p>  <p><span>The fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>has been divisive, as it’s received criticism </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>for bad, overly simplistic writing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>awkward, corny sentimentality</span></a><span>. At this point, it’s entirely possible that the wave of critical reactions could just be bleedover from what many consider a subpar final season, but there have been a few pain points that fans are harping on, whether that be quippy writing, bad performances, or the special effects several people independently compared to those in Linkin Park’s 25-year-old music video for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4"><span>“In The End.”</span></a><span> Hell, there are even a few comments in the video’s YouTube comments referencing the bland, awkward CGI backdrops of some of the finale’s sequences.</span></p>

That is, of course, spread across the season’s eight episodes, but when the climactic otherworldly scenes all look this rough, you gotta wonder what that money was going toward.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the way the episode looks, the performances of several members of the cast have received some significant criticism, with much of it being directed to Finn Wolfhard. Some fans feel he couldn’t pull off what were supposed to be the episode’s biggest emotional swings, such as reacting to the “death” of Milly Bobby Brown’s Eleven, with whom his character has been romantically entangled for most of the show.</span></p>

			<p><strong>Elias Toufexis</strong>, a voice actor who you may recognize as the voice of Remi Letam from 2025's Hell is Us, but who you're more likely to recognize as the voice of <strong>Adam Jensen</strong> from <strong>Eidos Montreal's Deus Ex</strong> games, has a few strong words for those in charge of the immersive-sim franchise.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Toufexis shared four images to tell fans what he's working on in 2026. One of the photos was Marathon, while the other three were simple 'NDA' watermarks, indicating he's got at least four projects on the go and only one he can talk about.</p>



<p>Though if you were hoping one of those NDA'd projects would be a new Deus Ex game, that is unfortunately not the case. Toufexis followed up his initial post with a single-line shot directly at <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and its decision makers.</p>



<p>"<em>...No Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths</em>," Toufexis wrote.</p>

<p>The last two Deus Ex games, Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, are both excellent immersive-sim, third-person stealth games that were unfortunately never as commercially successful as they were critically. That said, the franchise has a long and important place in gaming history, and it's hard to imagine there's no desire for a new game in the series.</p>



<p>But that doesn't seem to be enough for the people actually making the call on whether to greenlight production on a new Deus Ex game. Embracer Group reportedly<a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/"> shut down the revival project at Eidos Montreal in January 2024</a>. Another <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/">report from April 2025 claims that Eidos tried pitching a new Deus Ex game to multiple publishers</a> but got no traction on the idea because they were told the series is too much of a niche. </p>



<p>It seems clear that Eidos Montreal would be more than willing to return to the world of Deus Ex. Besides the fact that the studio was pitching a new entry in the series just last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-may-return-embracer-outdo-cyberpunk-rumor/">it sees the series as an opportunity to "<em>do what Cyberpunk 2077 couldn't</em>."</a></p>



<p>But since Eidos voiced that goal, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/">has suffered multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-might-have-canceled-legacy-of-kain-game-new-layoffs-reported/">layoffs and project cancellations</a>, and the latest on what the team is actually working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-open-world-action-adventure-game-tomb-raider-team-out-next-year/">is a return to Tomb Raider and Lara Croft.</a></p>



<p>There technically is a Deus Ex game on the way, but it's a remaster of the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-remastered-delayed-indefinitely-pre-orders-refunded-aspyr-media/">that was just delayed indefinitely due to backlash and feedback from its reveal</a>. Still, fans of the franchise can only hope Eidos Montreal finds a path forward for a new adventure in the Deus Ex world.</p>
