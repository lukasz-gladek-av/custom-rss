		<p>Tides of Tomorrow is one of those gaming concepts that is both eye-opening in its breadth and ambitions, and mind boggling with all the possibilities it needs to account for. It’s both a game about time loops, and yet not one where you loop in time; a game where you are beholden to the actions of other players online, and yet one where you are playing solo and can play offline.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Tomorrow - Release Date Trailer [Official]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43RMfZzY-M4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the makers of Road 96, Tides of Tomorrow looks in many ways like it could be a high octane action game, but is much more a narrative adventure with action fed into it. The world of Elynd has been consumed by water and plastic waste, lending it an appearance that’s one part Waterworld and yet a little reminiscent of Splash Damage’s parkour shooter Brink – though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/05/10/review-brink/">looking at screenshots from 2011</a>, I must be misremembering just how bright and colourful that game was!</p>



<p>You start your story first by choosing who to follow, someone whose prior playthrough and choices are used as part of the basis of your own. This can be someone that’s been suggested by the game, from your friends list, or even using a specific game seed that’s shared online. All you’ll really know are some general traits for their playstyle and their completion percentage. You can also play this game without an internet connection, drawing from a pool of developer-created playthroughs baked into the game.</p>

<p>As you’re fished out of the water and resuscitated by Nahe, you have no memory of who you are and how you got there, but are quickly introduced to the ills that plague this world. Plastemia is a thoroughly fictionalised disease caused by microplastic pollution – a fictionalise ailment from a real world problem that we have yet to fully grasp the magnitude of –&nbsp;and in this world’s case, it’s a universal plague that’s lead to people with glowing plastic lesions spreading across their bodies. There’s a possible cure, though, and as a Tidewalker, you’re uniquely capable of bringing hope to this world.</p>

<p>Well, not quite uniquely. You’re not the first Tidewalker that has been dredged up, and you might not be the last –&nbsp;narratively there’s only been one Tidewalker before you, though there could have been millions. You and your people are connected, able to see glimmers of the past and events that went before you. Tides of Tomorrow takes this asynchronous multiplayer idea and wraps narrative, setting and so much more around it in truly fascinating ways. While some parts of the trailers might make it look like a PvPvE heist ’em up, you won’t actually encounter other players, just the consequences of their actions from potentially just a couple hours previously.</p>
<p>This works on both the micro and the macro level. Even in the opening dialogue with Nahe, you can see the dialogue choices made by the player you’re following, choosing whether to take the same path or to diverge to your own morality and feelings. Offered a dose of the Ozen that is able to stave off Plastemia, it’s up to you whether you take it or leave it for the next person. Alternatively, there might not be an Ozen dose for you if the previous player was a little selfish.</p>

<p>Later, coming to an NPC by a broken bridge and talking to them, they might accuse you of having broken it –&nbsp;your Tidewalker garb makes you all look largely the same –&nbsp;and you can switch to the Tides of Time vision to see the echoes of the previous player’s actions, just as you can leave actions behind for the next player to view. Turning that around and using it as a new conversation point, you can defuse the situation and potentially get the bridge repaired, not for yourself, but for the next Tidewalker coming through.</p>
<p>But, these choices can completely change the state of the world as you arrive. If the previous person caused a great big ruckus, the mayor could announce a general clamp down, blocking off the marketplace with barbed wire and guards, forcing you to try and stealth your way through, and hoping that the locals are still on your side. The time of day can change, the tone of the environment completely shift, and depending on how generous the other person was, you could find your own progress hampered by a lack of resources.</p>

<p>Thankfully you are given an off-ramp from that initial choice of followed player. Between missions, you float on the open, trash-filled water and are given a choice of who to follow for the next stage of the story and the next location. Additionally, you might be following a friend who’s only completed the first few missions, and so need to switch to another player as you overhaul their progress.</p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs. I’m truly fascinated to see how it all comes together when Tides of Tomorrow launches in February 2026.</p>

A 7-year-old budget gaming PC might do the job.</p><p>If you’re willing to settle for 1080p at 30fps in a online shooter (I won’t judge!) an RTX 2060 or RX 5600 XT or Arc A380 GPU with 6GB of video memory is apparently enough, with 16GB of RAM, 55GB of hard drive space, and a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 2600 or equivalent.</p><p>That’s even slightly lower than the open beta required, which needed 75GB of storage, and today’s the first time we’re seeing what developers say it’ll take to play at 4K60 Ultra (you’ll want pretty potent CPU <em>and</em> GPU for that).</p><p>Though, BF6 is offering a full complement of Nvidia, AMD, and Intel super-resolution and latency reduction techniques (DLSS 4, FSR 4, XeSS 2) with frame generation if you don’t need a native 4K image.</p><p>Unfortunately, I won’t be able to get my friends to play it with me: they’re boycotting over <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2807960">its lack of Linux support</a>, as <em>BF6</em>’s anti-cheat spares no thought for those of us trying to ditch Windows.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-elden-ring-nightreign-mode-is-about-to-ratchet-the-difficulty-up-to-11.1283217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Revealed weeks ago <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">in a datamine</a>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> publisher Bandai Namco has officially confirmed a new endgame difficulty mode coming to the multiplayer roguelite next month. Deep of Night features new relics, randomized challenges, and an endless mode for those able to reach it.</p> <p>“‘Deep of Night’ is a high-difficulty challenge mode designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times,” the publisher writes <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared">in a new blog post</a>. The mode arrives on September 10 during the game’s usual update time and changes up the usual <em>Nightreign</em> run in a few ways. Players won’t be able to select the Nightlord they face or which Shifting Earth event is active, and enemies will all be stronger.</p> <p>The “high-difficulty mode” is separated by various depths. Depth 1 is the easiest. Depths 2 and 3 are harder. Depths 4 and 5, meanwhile, feature an “endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills” so you can just play until you die. A skill-based matchmaking system will rank players and group them accordingly. Plus, new Relics and additional Vessel slots will give players more buildcrafting opportunities.</p>

 <h2>What does <em>Nightreign</em> change in Deep of Night?</h2> <p>The most challenging bit of Deep of Night might not be the boss fights either. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Players who have already been exploring the mode early</a>, thanks to mods, have found that the Night’s Tide storm, which slowly engulfs the map, does more damage. And that’s even before players suffer from a new debuff exclusive to gear discovered in the Deep of Night mode, which makes players more susceptible to the toxic rainfall. The rarest loot players pick up can come with other drawbacks as well to make surviving that much harder.</p> <p>For now, players have two more weeks to try and beat any Everdark Sovereigns that are still on their to-do list. For many, that’s probably Libra, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-libra-summons-everdark-tips-2000617780">a fight that’s equal parts clever and chaotic</a>. Fans have also already discovered clues for additional upcoming <em>Nightreign</em> content in the form of new subclasses. It’s unclear if those will be part of another free update or paid DLC in the future. There’s still so much of <em>Elden Ring</em> that could be repurposed into new content for the multiplayer spin-off.</p> <p>One thing that I’d love to see FromSoftware do, and which presumably wouldn’t cost any extra money, is just flip a switch to make all of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s random events spawn more frequently. Some players have spent 100 hours in the game and still only encountered them <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652">once or twice</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mini-crossword-paywall-free-new-york-times-games-angry-fans-wordle-2000620987</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nyt%E2%80%99s-mini-crossword-no-longer-free-to-play-and-fans-are-pissed.1283214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <em>Mini Crossword</em> is one of the most popular games offered by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nyt-connections-hint-fie-crossword-1850941717"><em>The New York Times.</em></a> And for years, it was free. But that changed recently, and fans aren’t happy about it at all, calling the newspaper company “greedy” for putting the game behind a paywall.</p> <p>In 2014, <em>The New York Times</em> launched a new, mini version of its famous crossword. The Mini Crossword became a popular hit for the newspaper as it only took a few minutes to solve, was updated daily, and was a perfect, tiny experience that became a part of many people’s morning routines. It also helped that the Mini Crossword was completely free to play. That just changed, however, and as you might expect, a lot of word-loving gamers aren’t happy about it.</p> <p>On August 27, <a href="https://parade.com/living/new-york-times-mini-crossword-placed-behind-paywall">with seemingly no warning</a>, thousands of players opened up the Mini Crossword as usual on their browser or phone, only to discover that the fun little word game was no longer free and was now locked behind a paywall. As of Wednesday, only those who have an NYT Games or newspaper subscription can access the Mini Crossword.&nbsp; And while not as popular as the Mini Crossword, two other NYT Games are also now locked behind a subscription: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NYTgames/comments/1n29sn6/mini_tiles_and_letter_boxed_behind_a_paywall/"><em>Tiles</em> and <em>Letter Boxed</em>.</a> But don’t worry, <em>The New York Times</em> has conveniently made sure to offer a discount on subscriptions to its games service right as it made this controversial change.</p>

 <p>Over on Twitter,&nbsp; posts from the NYT Games account often receive no more than seven or eight replies. <a href="https://x.com/NYTGames/status/1957482240948006914">But a recent tweet mentioning the Mini Crossword</a> has received over 60 replies. Most of them are from very angry players who are upset about the sudden change. Here are just some of the replies under that tweet:</p> <ul> <li>“You greedy fucks give me my free Mini Crossword.”</li> <li>“Y’all are evil putting the Mini behind a paywall…”</li> <li>“Ask your bosses how it feels to ruin a small part of thousands of people’s daily routines.”</li> <li>“GIVE US THE MINI CROSSWORD BACK YOU GREEDY SCUMBAGS”</li> </ul> <p>In recent years, <em>The New York Times</em> has become more of a video game company than a newspaper. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">Data shows that more people are paying the newspaper to play its games</a> than to read its news or consume any of its other content. While that has likely helped keep the paper afloat at a time when online and traditional media are struggling, it also means they are now beholden to gamers. So <em>The New York Times</em> should probably get used to having its mentions filled with angry people yelling.</p>

			<p>Even though the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over, you can still get the chance to play it again ahead of its launch on October 10, 2025. Alongside a new trailer for the PC version of Battlefield 6 that debuted today, EA and Battlefield Studios also resumed sign-ups for its Battlefield Labs playtesting program, where new maps, gameplay modes, and adjustments from the beta will be tested ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The trailer is a feature highlight reel of the experience PC players will be able to have, so long as they have the hardware for it, of course. With ultrawide monitor support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/">NVIDIA DLSS multi-frame generation support</a>, along with support for Intel XeSS and AMD FSR, and boasting 600+ customization options for PC. If you played the beta on your PC, then you're probably already aware of this. You're also probably aware of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">secure boot issue</a> that plagued many players just trying to get into Battlefield 6, which, in its own way, gets a mention in the trailer as it highlights the game's Javelin Anti-Cheat protection.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's more exciting is the fact that there's still a chance to play more Battlefield 6 before its launch, with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">Battlefield Labs sign-ups resuming again</a>. If you weren't already in the playtesting program, you're getting another shot, with the collective Battlefield Studios looking to test all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">changes previously discussed based on feedback from the beta</a>, along with new functionality for Battlefield Portal and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs playtesters will also get to try out new maps like Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley, and be able to test out Hardcore Mode for the first time.</p>



<p>If you loved the beta and are dying to play more Battlefield 6, then the Labs playtesting program is your best bet to jump in as soon as you can. Beyond that, you'll have to wait until it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025, to jump back in the fight.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767427/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby%E2%80%99s-new-switch-2-expansion-adds-just-the-right-amount-of-challenge.1283196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>So I heard you want to play <em>Kirby</em> on hard mode: tough bosses, tricky platforming, complicated puzzles, hidden collectibles, and maybe even punishments for failing. The <em>Star-Crossed World</em> expansion in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991829/nintendo-switch-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review"><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>’s Switch 2 edition certainly</a> introduces new challenges. There’s pressure from time constraints and consecutive platforming sequences, multistep puzzles, and bosses have more health, varied attacks, and phases. In <em>Star-Crossed World</em>, the promise of a more difficult <em>Kirby</em> game reaches its conceptual limits. But how hard can a game built around pressing one button to obliterate the problems in front of you get?</p><p><em>Kirby</em> games are easy and sometimes monotonous because answers almost always precede their questions. To keep things simple, almost every action that Kirby can take requires one button. Vacuum up an enemy or object and shoot it out, or copy its ability and replace your vacuum with whatever new power-up you have. These new verbs are often used to solve puzzles, such as burning a fuse, so they have to be given out to the player ahead of time. <em>Forgotten Land</em> kept things interesting by arranging its questions and answers in a 3D space and blending more clues to hidden collectibles into its various apocalyptic environments to obscure everything <em>just</em> enough.</p><p>In <em>Star-Crossed World</em>, 12 levels have been reshaped by the crystalline powers of a legendary meteorite, introducing alternate routes and areas. Each of these levels is stuffed with little puzzles and platforming challenges like the base game and filled with environmental clues to new hidden collectibles. It keeps you engaged, never giving away its secrets too easily. It’s more <em>Forgotten Land</em>, but <em>Forgotten Land</em> had some good ideas to expand on, like its signature gimmick, Mouthful Mode.</p><p>Mouthful Mode adds a little bit of friction. Instead of powered-up versions of other abilities, it introduces entirely new verbs that are incorporated into puzzles and set piece moments: drift, illuminate, glide… vend? Three new Mouthful Modes are mixed into <em>Star-Crossed World</em>’s levels: slide, gear, and spring.</p><p>Slide is used for bespoke skiing sections that contain collectibles in hard-to-reach places, and you’ll find yourself replaying these sections at least once if you’re concerned with getting everything. Gear lets Kirby climb up walls, introducing entirely vertical platforming sections with a satisfying haptic feeling in the hand. Spring is the most used, and for good reason. It emphasizes jumping and — consequently — falling. Unable to hover, spring plays a bit more like Mario, with moving platforms, timed paths, and the specter of starting a section over if you fall. Over five hours of gameplay, I was entertained by the new ideas and puzzles presented in these levels.</p><p><em>Star-Crossed World</em> also expands on <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>’s optional endgame, the Colosseum boss rush mode. It’s made challenging by endurance — many fights, limited healing. The game’s true final boss is waiting at the very end of the new Ultimate Cup Z EX, and it’s been supplanted again with a new entity to join Kirby’s pantheon of cute, eldritch, and cute eldritch demons that bow to the pink puffball.</p><p>Combat in <em>Forgotten Land</em> is built around another new verb introduced in the base game, dodge, and Colosseum squeezes everything out of Kirby’s few actions. Much like Link in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, closely evading an enemy’s attacks slows time, allowing Kirby to get hits in with vacuumed up stars or whatever copy ability is on hand. <em>Star-Crossed World</em>’s additional bosses add some new mechanics to the base game’s already powered-up variants of its original bosses.</p><p>And it all feels balanced around revisiting my old, near 100 percent save with leveled-up copy abilities that resemble demigod-like powers. Tornado turns from a gust into a hurricane, burn from a flame to purple dragon wings of fire. I mostly used my overpowered sword, which was drawn from the grim reaper that multiplies in size and crashes down with fiery tornadoes. Against even powered-up versions of basic bosses, it takes just two hits to deplete entire health bars.</p><p>Toward the end of the Colosseum, however, bosses get more health bars and more phases. They also deal out enough blows that losing all of Kirby’s health becomes an inevitable threat. Twenty minutes into the final fight, game over means restarting the run entirely.</p><p>That would be punishing if there were not plenty of health items you could buy ahead of time, if scanning Amiibo didn’t drop more healing items, and if copy abilities weren’t so overpowered. But that feeling of being overpowered is, I think, the point. It’s a bathetic balance — the moe kirby versus the end-time demon foretold in legend to reap the planet from beyond this dimension, or fighting a monarchical penguin to orchestral rock with an opera accompaniment. When Kirby decimates a lesser foe with the power of a hurricane, or a split atom, or death itself, I don’t feel like the game is anticlimactic, but has instead ramped up from trivial to lofty.</p><p>But Kirby doesn’t flatter your ego, either. I’m no god; we’re all equal when we hold down B for three charges to get the big hit in with our sword.

            <p>A bundle of games aiming to raise money to aid the United Nations' Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in their efforts to help Palestinian refugees is set to go on sale via Itch.io next week. Just over 380 games are part of it, including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lucifer-within-us">Lucifer Within Us</a>, and a <a href="https://pajamabeevegan.itch.io/cowlifesimrpg">cow life simulator</a> that features an alligator who's really into arson.</p>
<p>Organised by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/junchgaming.bsky.social">Junch</a> and the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seagamesforgood.bsky.social">South East Asian Games for Good initiative</a>, the bundle's dubbed Play for Peace - Games for Palestine. It's taken over 10 months to come together. The result's a 382-game strong bundle that includes a huge variety of creations that contain not a whiff of AI or NFTs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The people of Palestine continue to be subjected to hostility, destruction of homes, critical infrastructure, and devastasting loss of lives," reads the Play for Peace bundle's freshly-published <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle">Itch listing</a>. "We, as a games community, will bring together our incredible games from across the world, for a charity bundle with proceeds that go directly to Palestine aid and relief.</p>
<p>"We are partnering with UNRWA USA, who will receive the funds and grant them to <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/">UNRWA (UN agency)</a> in support of direct humanitarian aid in Palestine. Together, the game dev community and UNRWA USA will raise awareness on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">the situation in Gaza</a>, spotlight our communities, and the devs participating in this charity drive."</p><p>In addition to the games I mentioned in the intro - the cow life sim's definitely worth checking out - the bundle includes everything from lesbian devil-hunting action, courtesy of fittingly-named boss rusher <a href="https://itsmelilyv.itch.io/bossgame">Bossgame</a>, to tabletop adventures like <a href="https://heycentaur.itch.io/hetthamsya">Stirring the Hornet's Nest at Het Thamsya</a>. A couple of others that've caught me eye are <a href="https://black-heart-games-studio.itch.io/street-cleaning-day">Street Cleaning Day: Rat's Revenge</a>, a wave-shooter about a rodent fending off soapy bubbles, and <a href="https://goosewho.itch.io/i-get-this-call-every-day">I Get This Call Every Day</a>.</p>
<p>The latter's a point-and-click simulation of its creator's experience working in a call centre, featuring "terrible art [which] conveys a terrible work environment" and the choice of whether to "lose politely or lose spectacularly".</p> <div>

<p>If that brutal reality isn't for you, there's also <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/fit-for-a-king">Fit For a King</a>, a Henry VIII simulator that offers the chance to marry everything, execute everything, and/or spend it all. "While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fit-for-a-king">Fit For A King</a> could have been full of lazy, bargain bin Blackadder jokes, it’s got a wonderfully dadaist edge to its humour instead, and an indefinable atmosphere I could only call early 2000s web game energy," former RPSer Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-fit-for-a-king">wrote of that one</a>. Or, there's <a href="https://daffodil.itch.io/virtua-blinds">Virtua Blinds</a>, which looks like it could be the greatest thing I've never played.</p>
<p>As the bundle's curators wrote: "All of it represents the creative expression of artists and developers who want to help raise money through their art for one of the most important causes of our time - freedom and the ending of genocide in Palestine." The Play for Peace - Games for Palestine bundle will be on sale from 5PM BST/12PM ET/9AMPT/6PM CEST on September 2nd, and will cost $8.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-pc-trailer-reveals-most-advanced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-pc-trailer-reveals-%E2%80%98most-advanced-experience-in-franchise-history%E2%80%99.1283181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts has unveiled an all-new trailer for Battlefield 6, this one focused on the game’s PC ecosystem. It was highlighted that the PC version of Battlefield 6 represents the ‘most advanced PC experience in franchise history’, with a list of attributes longer than my arm. </p>



<p>The recent open beta for Battlefield 6 was a monumental success on PC especially, with Steam player counts skyrocketing to monumental levels. The hopes for the full launch on October 10 are still soaring as wishlist counts grow inexorably.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-pc-features-confirmed">All Battlefield 6 PC Features Confirmed</h2>



<p>The kickass new trailer for Battlefield 6 showcases the game’s PC accolades and attributes, including ultrawide support, uncapped frame rates, and 4K visuals. They’re elements that you’d expect from the highly anticipated Battlefield game, but it’s nice to see them rounded up in a specific trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official PC Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMBBXqu0OLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Beyond those elements, Battlefield 6 will also have support for DLSS, Intel XeSS, and AMD FSR’s latest versions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, as the team at Electronic Arts also stressed that Battlefield 6 on PC will have <strong>over 600 customization options</strong>. I assume that expanse covers everything from keybinds and color palettes to iconography and audio mechanics. Battlefield has always been a highly customizable game, but the team is going above and beyond this time around.</p>



<p>In the most recent Battlefield 6 news, an analyst came out to declare that this year’s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-already-beaten-battlefield-6-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Call of Duty title has already ‘beaten’</a> the imminent resurgence of Battlefield. Thanks to what he dubbed ‘autopilot purchasing’, there’s no way that Battlefield 6 will overcome Call of Duty this year.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-explains-why-kyle-crane-is-a-thirst-trap-in-dying-light-the-beast.1283178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re mere weeks away from the (delayed) release of Dying Light: The Beast. This long-awaited game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’</a> by many, including Techland’s franchise director. It’s an almighty iteration of the ten-year-old zombie apocalypse series that welcomes back Kyle Crane, who hasn’t been seen since the first game debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland published a blog post diving into the evolution of Kyle Crane between Dying Light (2015) and Dying Light: The Beast. Time hasn’t been kind to Crane, and he’s been brought back to the players in a twisted,<strong> </strong>animalistic state – but he’s also a hunk and a complete thirst trap.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<h2 id="h-crane-is-no-old-man">Crane Is No Old Man</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post published</a> on the Pilgrim Outpost, Techland explained that they didn’t want Kyle Crane to resemble an old man in Dying Light: The Beast:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We experimented with different approaches, and quickly discovered that details like graying hair or baldness are not an option as they made him feel like someone else or not as heroic as we envisioned him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While that’s a kick in the gut for any graying or balding folks out there, it’s indicative of the desire to keep Kyle Crane young-ish and virile. That’s easily represented in the recent screenshots posted by the team, which could have been pulled straight out of a pin-up calendar featuring our man Kyle Crane:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to Techland’s artistic experts, designing the new Kyle Crane was all about reflecting the decade-plus of abuse he’s suffered at the hands of his captors:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>His model went through multiple refreshes, until we reached a look that felt authentic.&nbsp; The goal was to show, in his face and body, what over a decade of imprisonment and torture did to him. His body carries scars and marks left by experiments. We didn’t just design random wounds – we thought carefully about what kinds of experiments he might have been subjected to, and what kind of traces they would leave behind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from the hue of Crane’s eyes to the veins on his arms has been painstakingly crafted to reflect the new era of this legendary character, played perfectly in The Beast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Roger Craig Smith</a>. The character model features a ‘duality’ that shows players there’s still something human inside the brute that is Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland revealed that Kyle Crane will evolve as the game unravels, becoming less of a monster as the story unfolds and he finds something of his former self after breaking free from his torturers and exacting revenge.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released worldwide on September 19. Are you picking up a copy? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

That’s a healthy 18% jump, and it tracks with what I’m seeing in collector circles: people are still chasing the big four gold cards, and Giratina seems to be the crown jewel. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqwlvp?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo VSTAR</a> has also caught some upward momentum lately, jumping from around $102 to nearly $127. It’s not just about nostalgia with this one – <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAvMk?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">its twin art featuring the Charizard faceoff</a> is iconic and playable decks still find room for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flipside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7NAR?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon VSTAR</a> has slipped from its February peak of $49.87 down to about $45.54. That’s not a dramatic crash, but it’s enough to suggest the hype has faded a bit. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2DoN?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deoxys VMAX</a> is feeling a sharper drop, now sitting around $36 after once approaching $45. These cards were never unplayable, but they’re not commanding the same attention in the meta or from collectors.</p><p id="pokmon-card-crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/feature-image-5-1756393956460.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7NAR?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon VSTAR</a> was riding high earlier this year, mostly on the strength of its gorgeous Galarian Gallery artwork and the general hype around Eeveelutions. But lately, it’s slipped about 9% in value. I think this one’s a mix of over-saturation and fading competitive relevance. Ivy Star is a solid switch ability, and Leaf Guard can wall a bit of damage, but the format’s gotten faster and more aggressive, and Leafeon just isn’t keeping up. It’s still a nice display piece, but with more copies floating around and other Secret Rares taking the spotlight, it’s drifting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxm48?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon VSTAR</a> is in a similar boat. It’s down about 10% from its February highs, currently sitting around $43. Crystal Star offers decent protection, and Icicle Shot has some control value, but let’s be honest – no one’s building their deck around this card anymore. Like Leafeon, its value was inflated by early demand from collectors chasing the full Eeveelution spread, but that moment seems to have passed. It’s still a strong artwork, but in today’s market, that’s not enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2DoN?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deoxys VMAX</a> has dropped nearly 20% since February, and I’m not surprised. Protective DNA is a cool ability on paper, reducing damage from opposing VSTARs, but it’s a little too niche in practice. Max Drain heals and hits for 160, which was decent a few metas ago, but now it feels underpowered. Players aren’t reaching for it, and collectors are more focused on the cleaner, flashier Secret Rares.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1y0V?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suicune V</a> has taken a heavier hit, dropping around 24% since May. This one hurts a little because I still think Blizzard Rondo and Fleet-Footed give it solid play value. But it’s been power-crept hard, and its role in decks has diminished. The artwork is still clean, and there’s nostalgia here, but in the context of the Galarian Gallery, it’s getting outshined. With so many cards in the set, not every V is going to hold long-term value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3W5R?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raikou V</a> has followed a similar path, slipping about 22% since March. It’s basically Suicune V’s Lightning-type twin, with the same draw ability and scalable damage based on benched Pokémon. Again, decent in a vacuum, but there are just better, more dynamic options now. This feels like a victim of set fatigue – there are too many similar cards in Crown Zenith, and only the top-tier ones are holding collector or player attention.</p><p id="pokmon-card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/feature-image-4-1756393853900.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJk3k?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina VSTAR (Secret)</a> is having a real moment. It’s jumped nearly 18% in the last month, and honestly, I think it still has more room to grow. Lost Impact and Star Requiem are both game-ending tools in the right deck, and the alt-art gold treatment puts it near the top of many collectors’ wishlists. If you’re looking for a high-end Crown Zenith card to hold, this one feels as stable as it gets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqwlvp?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo VSTAR</a> has quietly surged too, climbing around 24% since June. Star Raid and Psy Purge both offer serious utility, especially in matchups where you want to punish your opponent for loading their board with Vs. But let’s be real – this one’s rising just as much for the art as the gameplay. That Charizard vs. Mewtwo scene is one of the most memorable alt-arts in the set, and people are starting to grab it before prices push any higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgB5n?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arceus VSTAR (Secret)</a> has seen a solid 14% boost, and it’s one of those cards that straddles playability and collectibility perfectly. Starbirth is still one of the strongest consistency abilities in the game, letting you grab any two cards from your deck. Trinity Nova helps ramp energy quickly, which is never out of style. The gold art has a premium feel, and with Arceus being such a central figure in the franchise, it’s an easy card to like long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8g4b?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</a> is up 16% since July, and I think people are finally waking up to just how powerful Star Chronos can be. Taking an extra turn is one of the rarest effects in the game, and when paired with the right energy acceleration, it’s absolutely devastating. Metal Blast scales well too. From a collector standpoint, the gear-and-time themed art is eye-catching, and scarcity is keeping demand high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbbwgx?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Finally, Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR (Secret)</a> has climbed around 13%. Star Portal remains one of the best ways to recycle Water Energy, and Subspace Swell scales nicely with full benches, which are common in current lists. The art has a dynamic, aquatic style that’s really grown on people. It may not be as flashy as Giratina, but it’s a steady riser, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it break the $70 mark soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

There’s plenty to note in here for fans, but highlights include the new Techmarine class, now set for release during the first quarter of 2026, a new Battle Barge expansion during the same period, and a new Siege map coming Q2 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer, below, reveals a first look at some of this new content, including the Chaos Spawn and the Mutalith Vortex Beast, and new weapons the Pyreblaster, Pyrecannon, Power Axe, Combi Melta, and the Xenophase Blade. The latter is a Power Sword-like melee weapon created with alien (we think Necron) tech and used by warriors of the Deathwatch Chapter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Year 2 content:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Four new Operations and a new Siege map</li><li>Two new Eternal War arenas</li><li>New Stratagems (PvE) and Helbrute Onslaught (PvP) game modes</li><li>New playable class: The Techmarine</li><li>New weapons and free unlockable weapon variants for existing weapons</li><li>New enemies and bosses</li><li>New Progression mechanics</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The September 4 Anniversary Update also comes with the release of Space Marine 2’s second Season Pass and its first two DLCs: the Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack, including a new Champion skin for the Bulwark class and Power Sword skin for the former, and over 40 new cosmetics celebrating seven of the Imperial Fists’ Successor Chapters for the latter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Year 2 roadmap image, below, mentions the new Omnissiah Axe coming alongside the Techmarine. This is a potentially different weapon than the Power Axe shown off in the trailer, so the hope is it functions in a fresh way as well as looks unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, the Season Pass II will grant players nine new DLCs, with new Champion skins, armour pieces, and heraldry markings. While existing Chapters like the Blood Angels and Salamanders are to receive new cosmetics, fan-favorite Chapters like the Raptors, Iron Hands, and Carcharodons will get their due time in the spotlight.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/unnamed-12-1756393367664.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 Year 2 DLC roadmap.

                <p>Bella Ramsey, who stars in HBO's The Last of Us as Ellie, has a message for viewers who are upset about the show and the changes from the source material heading into Season 3: "You don't have to watch it."</p><p>Appearing on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6pdBtYGyS44Tvv0Xy46HXn?si=_bMLHvokTTugDZwPztkSUg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=9ac8872088cd4e28" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Awardist podcast</a> (<a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1960918774498124195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Culture Crave</a>), Ramsey first reacted to the controversial second season, in which Kaitlyn Dever's Abby brutally murders Joel (Pedro Pascal). Ramsey said they tried to "steer clear" as much as possible from the discourse and controversy.</p><p>"There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn't affect the show, it doesn't affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they're very separate things to me. So no, I just don't really engage," Ramsey said.</p><p>In the lead-up to Season 3, Ramsey said people can simply play the game if they want that story.</p><p>"I would say, you don't have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don't have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it," Ramsey explained.</p><p>The Last of Us TV series takes notable departures from the source material, and that was always the plan. Showrunner Craig Mazin said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-writer-expecting-furor-over-season-2/1100-6515962/" data-ref-id="1100-6515962">expecting "furor" from fans over Season 2</a>, and that is indeed how some fans reacted. Others enjoyed and embraced Season 2. "We don't operate to either make people happy on social media or avoid making them upset," Mazin said.</p><p>The Last of Us series veteran Neil Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-game-co-creator-neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-the-hit-hbo-series/1100-6532923/" data-ref-id="1100-6532923">not involved with Season 3</a>, as he is instead focusing on his efforts at Naughty Dog and directing the upcoming new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p>The Last of Us Season 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-tv-boss-reacts-to-neil-druckmann-leaving-and-reveals-season-3-release-window/1100-6533189/" data-ref-id="1100-6533189">will premiere in 2027</a>.

<p>Deep of Night will arrive on 11th September and have stronger enemies in it. You won't be able to specify the Nightlord you want to fight and ongoing terrain changes won't be reflected. </p>
<p>"Furthermore, the difficulty increases the deeper you descend," the Nightreign team said. "The ratings will fluctuate based on wins and losses, affecting the 'depth'."</p>
<p>There will be some special items exclusive to Deep of Night, but be warned that some "detrimental effects" will also appear.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What began as a trickle has turned into an avalanche. Workers on <em>Diablo </em>are the latest arm of Blizzard to unionize, with Communications Workers of America (CWA) – which helped other Microsoft-owned studios unionize – saying that over 450 developers across multiple disciplines voted in favor of unionizing. It’s been a long time coming, though layoffs certainly sped up the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Diablo </em>team joins the <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft </em>team</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/overwatch-developers-form-nearly-200-person-union-at-blizzard-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Overwatch </em>team</a>, the <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Story and Franchise Development team</a>, and numerous <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios</a> across Microsoft totaling out to thousands of unionized workers, a direct result of the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union neutrality deal</a> Microsoft struck with CWA in 2022 when it was facing regulatory scrutiny over its $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard. We’ve come a long way since small units at Raven and Blizzard Albany <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/national-labor-relations-board-finds-merit-charges-against-blizzard-illegal-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fended off Activision Blizzard’s pre-acquisition attempts at union busting</a> in 2022 and 2023, and not a moment too soon: Microsoft’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penchant for mass layoffs</a> has cut some teams to the bone and left others warily counting down the days until their heads land on the chopping block. This new union, workers hope, will act as a bulwark.</p><p>“After the [late 2023 Microsoft-Activision Blizzard] merger, CWA was able to come onto the campus for the first time, and the room that they held their first group event ... was in the building where the <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unannounced Survival Game</a> development team was being housed,” Kelly Yeo, game producer on <em>Diablo IV</em> and early member of the union organizing committee, told Aftermath. “A week to the day after that event [in early 2024], the entire project was canceled, and hundreds of people from that building were laid off. So that was a really radicalizing moment for me."</p><figure><blockquote><p>That really lit a fire for me of 'We should do something.'</p></blockquote></figure><p>“I was a long-term remote employee living in New York, and I just happened to be on campus the week CWA was there,” Skye Hoefling, senior software engineer II and fellow <em>Diablo </em>union OG, told Aftermath. “The next week, the layoffs happened. The person I was moving in with worked on Battle.net, and they lost their job. ... That really lit a fire for me of 'We should do something.'”</p><p>More rounds of layoffs, regrettably, followed in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-09-27/activision-blizzard-to-begin-layoffs-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025</a>, bringing the tally up to over 3,000 across Microsoft’s gaming division since the beginning of 2024. July’s layoffs, especially, sealed the deal for some <em>Diablo </em>team members.</p><p>"[Recent layoffs] did actually galvanize a lot of people,” said Yeo. “There are some people that we had been speaking to that were very on the fence about it, and that was sort of a catalyst for them – or I guess the last straw. It feels like every time it happens, the noose tightens a little more for anybody left behind.”</p><p>While the <em>Diablo </em>team emerged from <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last month’s bloodletting</a> relatively unscathed, union members view now as a time to secure and enshrine every available protection in a contract. Some of this will be based on the experiences of other Microsoft unions. Recent layoffs, which led to the cancellation of an unannounced Zenimax MMO, served as a test of the Zenimax QA union’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly won contract</a>.</p><p>"It sucks to see how [QA] basically had to test their contract and layoff protections almost immediately after negotiating their contract,” said Yeo, “but it is good to see in action that we have tangible proof: They've definitely improved layoff procedures and severance and things like that. … For other units, they were able to negotiate – immediately after they've gotten notifications of the layoffs and who is being let go – to save some jobs or make a case for saving jobs for people who are essential. Obviously the ideal is that we'd be able to save all jobs, but they were at least given a chance."</p><p><em>Diablo </em>union organizers plan to survey members and assemble a list of high-priority concerns ahead of contract negotiations, but based on preliminary conversations with prospective members, they can already hazard a few guesses as to what they’ll be arm-wrestling management over at the bargaining table: pay equity, AI, crediting, and remote work.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>We know that Microsoft and Blizzard make a lot of money. They can absolutely afford to pay us more.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Disputes over pay are as old as time itself – which money is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urr7sQ7yndg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously</a> the same thing as – but Blizzard employees have long been faced with a unique dilemma: Prestige often comes with a pay cut relative to what a similar skillset might command at other game studios or tech companies.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you look even just at other gaming studios, pretty much anybody you talk to, if they talk to somebody else that's in their equivalent position or maybe a title below them, their compensation is vastly different,” Ryan Claudy, who helped organize Blizzard Albany’s union before moving into production and sharing his knowledge with the <em>Diablo </em>team, told Aftermath. “We know that Microsoft and Blizzard make a lot of money. They can absolutely afford to pay us more."</p><p>Claudy pointed to what he calls the “passion tax.” Game workers, he said, often get paid less than their tech industry counterparts because they’re passionate about what they do, and passion can be taken advantage of. Microsoft is a tech company, making discrepancies all the more arbitrary.</p><p>"With the acquisition, I was initially excited because I know that Microsoft is top of the industry when it comes to healthcare and all that sort of stuff,” Claudy said. “But the way integration has worked, there are certain things that we get that are granted to all Microsoft employees, but not everything. There's different things that those of us under Activision and Blizzard and King don't get, that others do get. So I think that would be one of the first things we bring to the table: 'Hey, treat us equitably with everybody else you already employ.'"</p><p>AI is another potential locus of conflict, especially considering how <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tyrannically AI-obsessed</a> Microsoft has become in recent years. Yeo said that in their experience, AI has certainly found its way into Blizzard’s development pipeline over time, but so far, it’s yet to worm its tendrils around the final game.&nbsp;</p><p>“[Generative AI] is starting to creep in a lot,” said Yeo. “I can only speak for art, where in the visual development stage, if people don't feel like they have concept art support, they'll just toss things into Stable Diffusion or whatever and then do mood boards and stuff and give that to the teams to give them guidance.”</p><p>They added, however, that various materials posted to internal channels make it seem like management is “signaling that they want to use or integrate more [AI] into the pipelines in the future,” which is why it’s important for the union to take a stand now.&nbsp;</p><p>"There is definitely a growing concern across most of the artists like 'Is this going to replace us?'” said Yeo. “And speaking to Zenimax workers, they were able to negotiate for better guidelines around AI usage that focuses on using it as a tool and not a replacement – and also that it's not used to harm workers, and if it does harm workers, that the people creating the tools can be held accountable."&nbsp;</p><p>"A topic among card signers is [whether] we're going to be required to use AI and ethical concerns with it,” said Hoefling.</p><figure><blockquote><p>[Generative AI] is starting to creep in a lot.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Currently, Microsoft is facing scrutiny from within and without for one of the least ethical uses of AI imaginable: Facilitating Israel’s genocide in Gaza via Azure Cloud and generative AI-powered surveillance tech. <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Azure For Apartheid</a>, a movement made up of current and former Microsoft employees, has repeatedly protested these military contracts, recently leading to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-staff-perform-sit-in-protest-in-company-presidents-office-over-israeli-military-ties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrests and firings</a>. On the gaming side of things, unionized workers at Arkane, a Microsoft-owned studio, have aligned themselves with No Azure For Apartheid and <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-azure-arkane-israel-palestine-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded</a> that Microsoft cease being an “accomplice of a genocide.”</p><p>On this front, it’s still early days for the <em>Diablo </em>union, which has yet to discuss Microsoft’s involvement with Israel as a committee. However, organizers recognize the cause as worthy, and they hope to bring it forward in the future.</p><p>"It would be a discussion we would have once we've certified the rest of our unit to discuss ... if we're able to support the larger movements across Microsoft,” said Yeo. “But it's definitely something we'd be interested in talking to other units about, because I feel pretty strongly about it, and honestly [it's] insane if people don't."</p><p>"I've been following it in the news and watching the [protests] that happened in Redmond,” said Hoefling. “It makes me think about, once we formalize, if we were to do something like that in [the <em>Diablo </em>team], having everything certified protects us where we can do something like that."</p><p>In the nearer term, <em>Diablo </em>team members just want to be able to keep doing their jobs – and, if push comes to an unceremonious shove out the door, to at least have something to show for it all.&nbsp;</p><p>"You have to be here for a certain number of months to be credited on games, and many people that worked on <em>Diablo IV</em> are not credited on the base game," said Hoefling. "We all got credited on the expansion, and one of my coworkers was, like, one day under. But we were all there."</p><p>"I also want to point out that after the January layoffs, because of the policy where if you have left the team six months prior to launch, you would be moved to 'special thanks' instead of your actual position ... [many], from directors to associates, are all lumped under 'special thanks,'" said Yeo. “They didn't have any control over being laid off."</p><p>Crediting more people wouldn’t even be difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;“It costs nothing,” said Yeo.</p><p>This is also why remote work – <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an ongoing battle at Activision Blizzard</a> that has resulted in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-blizzard-qa-staff-walk-out-over-return-to-office-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walkouts</a> over what employees view as “soft layoffs” – remains a hot topic: There is a world in which Blizzard makes it easier for employees to do good work, as opposed to more difficult, and it’s imminently achievable. The <em>Diablo </em>team is already spread out, with Irvine and Albany as its primary locations. Blizzard also has offices in Austin and Boston, as well as multiple studios in Asia. As a result, cramming everyone into a single space is an impossible pipe dream. Moreover, the alternative has already proven itself to be viable.</p><p>"Blizzard has showcased it, and the whole industry has showcased it, that remote work works,” said Claudy. “I think it's limiting the company [to force people to work out of offices] because during the pandemic you could hire anybody from anywhere. They didn't have to leave; they didn't have to move. Your talent pool is suddenly way bigger. ... There's no real argument against remote work, except the control part, where now they know where you are and what you're doing."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>There's no real argument against remote work, except the control part, where now they know where you are and what you're doing.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Distance and difficult-to-come-by work-from-home exemptions certainly haven’t prevented workers on the <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, and now <em>Diablo </em>teams from banding together.</p><p>"We're all learning and growing together and sharing knowledge in a way that I think is super helpful for community building,” said Yeo, “because teams at Blizzard tend to be very siloed; I kind of joke and say that it's like five studios in a trench coat. Breaking down those walls and fostering that sense of community and knowledge sharing has been very helpful."</p><p>Ultimately, that’s the element of this unionization wave that has <em>Diablo </em>union organizers feeling most hopeful: Where once they only had numbers, now they have strength.</p><p>"I've never been involved with any community-based anything, really. I'm kind of a loner,” said Yeo. “Getting to know and build this community has been the greatest reward for me in this process – getting to know people that I would never work with in such a large studio."</p><p>“This union is so important to me,” said Hoefling. “The community we have built on [the <em>Diablo </em>team] just by organizing alone. There are so many people here now that get to go and just talk to each other and meet other people that we didn't have an opportunity to before.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt"><h3>AI Can’t Suffer, But It Should Suffer For This</h3></a><p>It's the sentience of AI's creators that really matters</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only more bloody downloadable content for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. Developers Saber Interactive are supposed to be working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a>, but you wouldn't know that from all the Stuff they've jammed into the previous game's year 2 content schedule. There's a major Anniversary patch due on 4th September, just in time for Silksong. Five more patches are coming over 2025 and 2026, plus nine DLC packs via season pass. The manufactorums are overflowing! Here's a video to lay it all out.</p><!--more-->

<p>The standout upcoming option is probably the new playable Techmarine class, who don't get any screentime here. What is a Techmarine? A Space Marine with a lot of spanners where parts of their anatomy should be. They're good at fixing stuff, though one suspects that, like most Sparse Maureens in Spice Margerine 2, they'll spend the bulk of their time murdering things.
</p>
<p>Techmarines aside, the free updates will add new enemies, bosses, weapons, progression mechanics, PvE stratagems, Eternal War arenas, and operations. Also, the chance to play a Chaos Helbrute, which looks like a berserking tractor with a comically small humanoid head. It's like Bruce Banner got 90% of the way through Hulking out and ran out of rage. Still, let's see if you're still laughing when it stands on your toes in the forthcoming Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode.

<p>As for those paid DLCs, there will be the usual shower of cosmetics. The new battle pass kicks off with the Black Templars Champion Pack, which includes a Champion skin for the Bulkwark class and a Power Sword skin. Then there's the Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack, which comprises 40 new cosmetics. Future packs will include cosmetics for the Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons. I'm pretty sure they made some of those Space Marine chapters up. Iron Hands, lol, as if.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em> a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce835lry896o">you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough</a> that it’s not changing its logo after all.</p> <h2>Capcom leaker claims the publisher has been trying and failing to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em></h2> <p>Fans have been begging Capcom for a new <em>Dino Crisis</em> for many, <em>many</em> years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/swikajakiin.bsky.social/post/3lxhsf5m5ss2x">a game with dinosaurs</a>, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of <em>Dino Crisis</em> isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763450801709199">The leaker claims</a> that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the<em> Dead Rising</em> sequels, was working on a remake of <em>Dino Crisis</em> before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more <em>Dino Crisis. </em>Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got <em>Resident Evil</em> back on track with RE7, the publisher can get <em>Dino Crisis</em> going again.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>‘s Xbox port is very different than the PS5 version</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Black Myth: Wukong Xbox Series X|S - DF Review - A Bizarre Port vs PlayStation 5" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-10490qd8s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s something odd: <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, <em>Wukong</em> on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes.</p> <p>This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>

 <h2>Crystal Dynamics announces another round of layoffs</h2> <p>On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game for Amazon, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">announced another round of layoffs.</a> The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of <em>Tomb Raider</em>” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March.</p> <p>“Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted.</p>

 <h2><strong>Epic boss says devs need more Unreal Engine 5 education to avoid optimization issues</strong></h2> <p>There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/tim-sweeney-on-unreal-engine-5-optimization-issues-the-main-cause-is-order-of-development/">at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea</a>. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC.</p> <p>“Many studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin early—before full content build-out. We’re doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so ‘optimize early’ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Laid-off <em>Black Panther</em> game devs join Wizards of the Coast</strong></h2> <p>Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">in an interview with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s <em>Black Panther</em> game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes<em> Shadow of Mordor</em> and <em>Rome: Total War.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can’t tell you yet.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-creator-still-not-sure-when-his-next-game-is-coming-out-2000620743"><em>Bioshock’s</em> creator still doesn’t have a release date for <em>Judas</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level-2000620693"><em>Hitman</em> is out now on phones, but it will cost you $70</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-patch-cassidy-wrecking-ball-bug-2000620763"><em>Overwatch 2′</em>s latest update broke its famous cowboy character</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&amp;M lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Many Unique M&amp;M's Characters Exist?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yzYtUue5Y4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

                <p>September 4 is quite the scary date for indie devs this year. You probably already know why, but here's the reason anyway: After a long wait, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/">finally arriving on that exact date</a>. It's easily going to be one of the biggest indie releases of the year, and because of that fact, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">number of indie games</a> have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/">opted for a delay</a> to avoid being drowned out by the Silksong-mania. One exception is a co-op racing party game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fling-to-the-finish/" data-ref-id="5000-494249">Fling to the Finish</a>, as the companies responsible have decided to release its console ports on the same day as Silksong.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Daedalic Entertainment and developer Splitside Games confirmed the game will be releasing on console September 4 in a press release, referencing Silksong in a tongue-in-cheek manner: "Arriving same day as THAT metroidvania." To be fair, as you can see in a trailer below, there's no real reason to think that Fling to the Finish is in any direct competition with Silksong.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVmKO10jaT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cVmKO10jaT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Fling to the Finish is more in the vein of games like Human: Fall Flat, as it sees you playing as perfectly spherical, cartoonish characters that are tied together two at a time. You then have to maneuver through various obstacle courses as you try not to drag your friend down with you, all while racing other players. Apart from both games featuring platforming, their target audiences couldn't be more different, so there's no reason to think Silksong should affect Fling to the Finish's release on console.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also play Fling to the Finish in solo, online multiplayer, local split-screen, and both local and online co-op, and there's cross-play between platforms too. If you really want to start an argument with your friends, there's even a "share a controller" local co-op mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Fling to the Finish launches on September 4, and you'll be able to play it on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. It's already available to play on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum’s</a> latest update is out now, bringing a bunch of free new content as part of The Digiverse. Collect arcade cabinets, pixel art video game memorabilia, and the murky depths of a new Dredge collaboration with a new expedition map to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Update 5.0 | OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRBCcrB_4zk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Digiverse sees multiple rifts opening that you can send your curators through to explore, bringing back items to display that are all themed around Meat Wizard – I can’t tell if this is meant to be a lewd euphemism or not, but it feels like it might be – and indie hit Dredge. The former is all video game-y, while the latter adds new remote islands to reach and brings more variety to your maritime museums.</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the two sides of this update. For Meat Wizard you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a nostalgic trip into the County’s video game history<wbr></li>
<li>Adventure in Meat Wizard 1 &amp; 2, and perhaps discover the franchise’s darkest secret…<wbr></li>
<li>Discover seven new Exhibits across four new Points of Interest<wbr></li>
<li>Build two new Interactive Displays: Meat Wizard Arcade Machines<wbr></li>
<li>Find and unlock Power Ups, a new boon-giving project for the workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, for Dredge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore three remote points of interest across the archipelago &amp; unlock new decor<wbr></li>
<li>Dredge the depths to discover ten fresh catches. We’d advise you don’t set sail at night…<wbr></li>
<li>Fight the Unfathomable. Are your experts’ minds strong enough to gain knowledge of the depths?</li>
</ul>
<p>But it also just so happens to be the seventh anniversary of Two Point Hospital, where this studio’s life started. To mark the occasion, they’re bringing back the Blob Fish, which was added to the universe in the Exhibition pack for Two Point Hospital, and is now back to blob things up in Two Point Museum. Just head to the new&nbsp;<wbr>Temple of the Blobs, found southwest on the Bone Belt underneath Hermit Hills.<wbr></p>

<p>Further enhancements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added new perks for the Security Camera Booth, Bandage Box and Aquarium Filter:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Security Signal Boost: </b>Increases the range of connectivity with Security Cameras<wbr></li>
<li><b>Bandage Bogs: </b>Allows Bandage Box to increase staff Toilet Comfort<wbr></li>
<li><b>Bandage Brew:</b> Allows Bandage Box to offer coffee for staff<wbr></li>
<li><b>Extra Expert-Seas: </b>Experts gain additional XP during aquarium restoration<wbr></li>
<li><b>Focused Fish Food:</b> Reduces food dispenser Messiness (-5)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Self-Cleaning Water: </b>Increases Filter Power (+10)<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Expert subclasses are now viewable in expedition setup &amp; training<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added ‘Call security’ button to the Goblin Statue<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some qualifications now add Fantasy Stats when a Fantasy expert trains in them:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Aerodynamics</b>: +3 Dexterity per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Analysis</b>: +3 Intelligence per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Happy Thoughts</b>: +3 Luck per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Survival Skills</b>: +3 Strength per level<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…and much more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Made a significant number of improvements to the gamepad UI<wbr></li>
<li>Added additional language support for LATAM Spanish, Russian and Thai<wbr></li>
<li>Improved Bean-Brained, Junk Foodie and Lard Lad/Lass traits so that they provide a long-lasting status effect instead of an instant increase to their respective stats<wbr></li>
<li>Space decorations will now give a decoration bonus to their respective subcategories<wbr></li>
<li>Improved the Security Room coffee machine and doughnut table so that they both fulfil their respective Food and Drink stats to 100% (Previously, they only added +15%)<wbr></li>
<li>Reduced the number of guests required to complete showcase exhibit objectives</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Head here for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2185060/view/545618256387375629">the full Two Point Museum Update 5.0 changelog</a>.</p>
<p>The update arrives not long after the first major expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-review/">Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds</a>. Laura had a grand time with this, saying, “Although Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds doesn’t come with an accompanying fantasy museum, the new Scorched Earth expedition map, exciting newfangled exhibits, intriguing fantasy Expert subclasses and great array of extra features and unlockables makes it a fantastic excuse to re-visit your favourite Two Point game. As if you needed an excuse…”</p>

<p>Art Attack</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last month, Nintendo brought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to the SNES Nintendo Switch Online Library, finally unlocking the Mouse Mode experience we had all been dreaming of. It was a neat addition, no doubt, but there was something missing in diving back in on our shiny new Switch 2s, something that could only be achieved by playing a second-hand copy of the game on its original hardware: save files.</p>
<p>By playing on NSO, our games were all squeaky clean, with no sign of any pre-existing blast-from-the-past artwork. We're not claiming that we used to be '<em>artists</em>' on the SNES back in the day, but there's something sweet about looking back over old drawings, right? It gives us a peek into a different time, where abilities and priorities couldn't get in the way of putting virtual pen to virtual paper. Ah, to reminisce...</p>
<p>The lovely Zion over on our video team obviously felt the same way and took on the behemoth task of collecting a whopping 100 copies of Mario Paint on the SNES, just to search for any hidden gems on the cartridges. It was a serious undertaking (like, $500 and <em>a lot</em> of time 'serious'), but the results were... well, you'll just have to watch the video to find out!</p>
<p>Above, you'll find Zion's journey to reaching the big 100 (accompanied by some sweet art by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/guppies.bsky.social">@Guppies</a>), and get a look at what he uncovered along the way. It's a long one, so grab yourself a brew and settle in for some cosy nostalgia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>RGG Studio and SEGA have <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/sega-and-rgg-studio-announce-rgg-summit-2025-air-date-tune-in?utm_source=prezly.com&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=SEGA%20and%20RGG%20Studio%20Announce%20RGG%20Summit%202025%20Air%20Date%20%E2%80%93%20TUNE%20IN&amp;utm_id=30fec83b-0cfc-4d7c-8c3e-f1a1e5d758a3&amp;utm_content=story%20header">announced</a> the RGG Summit 2025, and an RGG Direct is coming next month on September 23, at 8pm PT / 11pm ET / September 24 at 4am BST. While there are no specific projects mentioned, there are a few titles we could be hearing about, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven,</a> and the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Virtua Fighter Project</a>.</p>



<p>The summit will be where we'll hear all the announcements RGG Studio and SEGA have, with the RGG Direct following being where we'll hear more details about what was announced during the summit.</p>



<p>"<em>Providing fans with the latest updates from the studio, <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong> will take place on <strong>Wednesday, September 24 at 04:00 BST (</strong>Tuesday 23 September 20:00 PT). Following the conclusion of RGG Summit 2025, a <strong>new RGG Direct</strong> will also air, giving viewers a deeper dive into the newly announced information</em>," the company announced in a press release.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The RGG Direct will follow immediately after the RGG Summit. Image credit: RGG Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>It might be a long shot to hope for, but earlier this year we had some indication from SEGA that Stranger Than Heaven <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/">won't be out until 2027</a>. Even if we don't get a proper release date, it would be good to have a release window that doesn't point to players having to wait the whole of next year before Stranger Than Heaven hits store shelves.</p>



<p>We also <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">recently got a look at</a> RGG Studio's Virtua Fighter Project, with proper gameplay being showcased for the first time earlier this month, but we've yet to have a more detailed deep dive into what RGG Studio is building in this game. Hopefully, we start to get those answers next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has been confirmed for a series of upcoming PC games. One of them is Battlefield 6, though the recent beta already included the support, making this old news for those who already played the game. We do have a new trailer, anyway, which confirms DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex to be available when the game launches on October 10.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official PC Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihepSn-In6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Tomorrow, Friday, August 29, Ultizero Games will release the long-awaited action game Lost Soul Aside. Developed initially by lone creator Yang Ming, Lost Soul Aside has evolved over time and is now finally ready to launch. On PC, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, as well as Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray-traced shadows and reflections. According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards will run the game up to five times faster when turning on all DLSS technologies. By the way, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment has not provided any pre-launch codes to press, so expect reviews to come in at a later time.</p>



<p>On the same day, NetEase's free-to-play MMORPG Sword of Justice (formerly known as Justice Online) will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Reflex, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. The latter will help greatly with the game's path tracing implementation. Sword of Justice is currently available in China, but a global release has already been confirmed to be on the way soon. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sword of Justice | Path-Traced RTX On Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UVtmNIKYuF0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Today, the free-to-play action RPG game Wuthering Waves is adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The game already supported DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and ray traced reflections, but with Multi Frame Generation, GeForce RTX 50 Series owners can look forward to a 4.3x performance boost with ray tracing enabled and all graphics settings maxed out. As you can see in the performance chart below, the RTX 5090 gets almost 290 FPS, while the 5080 is at 225 FPS and the 5070 Ti at 205.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game adding Multi Frame Generation is the cooperative first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-has-officially-released-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>. Again, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but now those equipped with Blackwell GPUs will enjoy even faster frame rates.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, CCP Games added all main upscaling technologies (NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS, and MetalFX) to EVE Online. When it comes to DLSS, Super Resolution and Frame Generation are implemented, and Multi Frame Generation (as well as DLAA) can be toggled with the override in the NVIDIA app. EVE Online also looks better now, thanks to the newly introduced ray-traced shadows.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA has also released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 581.15) optimized for the Wuthering Waves update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants DLC</a>, adding RTX Hair to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have revealed what you can expect from next week's&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Anniversary Update, as well as what's coming as part of the game's second full year of content.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500582260112622093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s Anniversary Update, otherwise known as Update 10.0, lands on September 4th (a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">very important date in the gaming calendar</a>). It brings with it a brand new PvE mission, a new Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode, three new weapons, and tons more.</p>

<p>It'll be the last-but-one update this year, with Patch 11 set to arrive sometime in the fourth quarter. It'll add another new PvE mission, as well as new mission pickups and new stratagems for you and your squad to consider.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-anniversary-update-year-2-roadmap.jpg?itok=IMkGVrlz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-anniversary-update-year-2-roadmap.jpg?itok=JoDBu-8p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots more coming to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Following these two patches,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-second-year-updates-dlc" rel="nofollow">Year 2 content drops</a> begin with Patch 12, which adds - you guessed it - another new PvE mission. You'll also get the new Techmarine class, as well as its Omnissiah Axe weapon and an expansion for the Battle-Barge.</p>

<p>Lots more is coming to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year as well, including more missions, new enemies, and new PvP arenas, as well as a new Siege map in the second quarter of 2026. Don't say Focus and Saber don't spoil you!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</i>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>), it's a sequel to the cult 2011 classic&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is a third-person shooter, but it has more of a focus on live-service-style updates and content than the first game did.</p>

<p>The campaign picks up the story of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus, who must battle through hordes of Tyranids in order to prove his loyalty to his chapter after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>A third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">is officially in development</a> following the success of the second installment, and not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently working on a game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">based on a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although we don't know which one just yet.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and if you want to know what I thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">read my review right here</a>.</p>

The studio announced “<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared">Deep of Night</a>,” a new mode for <em>Nightreign</em> that is focused specifically on difficulty.

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re considering a gaming laptop, but you understandably don’t want to spend anywhere near $2,000, <strong>MSI’s Katana gaming laptop</strong> with the midrange RTX 5070 GPU is $1,099 (was $1,499.99) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Katana-15-6-inch-QHD-165Hz-Gaming-Laptop-Intel-I7-14650HX-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-5070-16GB-DDR5-1TB-SSD-Black-2025%2F16625005777" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. This machine has a lot to offer aside from a solid graphics chip for gaming. It includes a 15.6-inch QHD screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM (upgradeable, in case you want to add more later on), and a 1TB SSD.</p><p>Most gaming laptops at this price include Nvidia’s less capable RTX 5060, along with an inferior processor. The RTX 5070 (with 8GB of video memory) should let you play most games at the screen’s native QHD resolution with ray tracing settings enabled. But, if games that you’re playing aren’t running as well as you’d like them to, many titles feature the option to turn on DLSS, Nvidia’s AI-powered feature that can greatly boost performance by upscaling lower-res graphics. That, or knock the game resolution down to 1080p instead of 1440p.</p><p>Lastly, as part of Intel’s Game Days, you’ll get a free copy of <em>Battlefield 6</em> with purchase of this laptop. Instructions for redeeming the game (which launches October 10th) are shown in the image gallery on Walmart’s product page. You’ll need to provide proof of purchase to Intel by September 30th, then redeem the code by Halloween.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re a fan of <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</em>, or perhaps you’ve heard how great the games are but have yet to try them, here’s a chance to get some of them for cheap. <strong><a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fduo-justice-ace-attorney-and-mega-man">The latest Humble bundle</a></strong> features several tiers, each of which include a smattering of Ace Attorney and Mega Man games. They games are redeemable on Steam, and play well on the Steam Deck, among other Windows and SteamOS gaming handhelds. If you click “5 Item Bundle” that costs $5, you can get the original <em>Ace Attorney Trilogy</em>, full of games that originally launched in the US on the Nintendo DS. This bundle also includes <em>Mega Max X Legacy Collection</em> and <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em>.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/http://costco.com/sony-wh1000xm5sa-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones---black-with-soft-case.product.4000374020.html" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> members in the US can get a special discount on Sony’s last-gen (but still great) <strong>WH-1000XM5 over-ear, noise-canceling headphones</strong> in black. Through September 7th, you can snag them for $249.99 (originally $399.99), which beats Amazon’s current $298 price. This price is the lowest we’ve seen, beating the previous low of $278 last December. This model is an improvement in a number of ways over its predecessor, the XM4, with a refined design, better sound quality (call quality is better, too), and enhanced active noise cancellation. If you’re deciding between this and the newer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/667017/sony-wh-1000xm6-hands-on">$449 XM6</a>, perhaps you ought to give the XM5 a try and potentially put that extra $200 back in your pocket. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>If an affordable 55-inch OLED TV is what you’re after, retailer <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FPNTV55Z85AP%2FPanasonic-Z85-Series-55-inch-OLED-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-Fire-TV-2024" rel="sponsored">BuyDig</a> has one. <strong>Panasonic’s 55-inch Z85 OLED</strong>, which we’ve previously featured in our coverage at $897, is down to just $699. This model includes Amazon’s Fire TV operating system, meaning that no extra device is necessary to begin streaming content from your favorite services. What also makes this a fantastic deal is that this purchase includes Panasonic’s wearable neck speaker (a $178 value) that can be connected to the TV for private listening. This TV likely isn’t as bright as pricier competitors, but it has some good specs, including a 120Hz refresh rate panel with four HDMI 2.1 ports, variable refresh rate, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/767400/msi-gaming-laptop-rtx-5070-sony-xm5-oled-deal-sale#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/767400/msi-gaming-laptop-rtx-5070-sony-xm5-oled-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
