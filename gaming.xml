            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/europa-short-and-sweet-wind-swept-journey<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Novadust Entertainment's first title,&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="162a359a-9322-42fc-b250-b20094c18466" href="https://techraptor.net/games/europa">Europa</a>, </em>effortlessly combines narrative exploration with 3D platforming. The terraformed moon is gorgeous, with sweeping vistas, waterfalls, snow capped mountains, and magical ponds. It features easy to pick up mechanics with no consequences for failing, coupled with an emotive narrative ready to wet your eyes.</p>
<h2>Nostalgic Notes from Father to Son</h2>
<p>You play as Zee, the son of Adam, who is heading to the floating island above Europa. Armed with the Zephyr backpack, you'll glide and hover your way through the different areas of&nbsp;<em>Europa.&nbsp;</em>Missing your father, you head to the island, where Adam directed him to go when Zee feels the time is right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mechanics are easy to pick up, primarily centered around gliding and hovering using energy gathered in the environment. There are aggressive AI constructs, but you can't die, only lose energy from Zephyr. This lack of fatality instills a relaxing vibe to the game, even though there are platforming elements that may evoke stress under different circumstances.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-environment.jpg?itok=a_AyH5SC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-environment.jpg?itok=BJ1NV0U- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story unfolds as you collect Adam's diary entries, left behind for Zee to find. The entries are marked with a column of gold light, making them easy to find in wide open spaces. Some can be hidden, but the story has a review when you leave one region to enter another. There were four of these review periods that summed up the diary entries, ensuring the critical plot details were known as the game progresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The narrative does get emotional as you near the Island. I didn't expect to be moved to tears, but I was. The story pulls at the heartstrings in all the right ways. You become invested in the father and son story, their relationship, and their experiences on&nbsp;terraforming&nbsp;the moon. Truly, the writing of&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is one of its strengths.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-zee-mind.jpg?itok=g2aBsApx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-zee-mind.jpg?itok=ahmKMtiL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Whimsical Environment</h2>
<p>The art of&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;further establishes the relaxing and stress free feeling of the game. The hills are a soft green, animals and friendly terraforming robots roam around crystal clear ponds. Fluffy clouds dot the sky and moss grows on the remnants of human buildings. The colors aren't harsh to look at and evoke the feeling of spring days. Even the harsher snow region is idyllic in design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutscenes and certain animal snapshots exude a magical feeling while playing. Similar to seeing an elephant at the zoo, these instances felt like rare occurrences that should be treasured. Given context with the story, the cutscenes were even more awe-inspiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matching the visual environment is the music, instrumentals that conjure images of quiet evenings, picnics with friends, lazy sun-kissed afternoons, and restful nights. It further reinforces the relaxing nature of&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>, even as I struggled to avoid energy steal bombs. I didn't lose this feeling at any point in time during my playthrough. Often with platformers I become frustrated, but this didn't occur even once while making my way to the Island.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-deer.jpg?itok=pIg5W3jB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-deer.jpg?itok=Ej4ATMl_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Europa is a Sentimental Bite-Sized Game</h2>
<p>For those with limited gaming time or who prefer shorter titles,&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is a title to explore. The main story can be completed in 3-4 hours, with more time investment for those that prefer collecting all the Emeralds, Zephyr upgrades, or earning every achievement. I completed it in three and a half hours with some extra exploration and struggles with some of the platforming (darn you jumping). Parents could potentially start and finish&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;during one solid nap time.</p>
<p>Players who prefer longer stories will still like&nbsp;<em>Europa.</em>&nbsp;While it has a shorter playtime, the story is complete from start to finish. There aren't any side quests, but there are multiple items to collect, sketches to draw, and enemies to flawlessly avoid. On top of that, it's such a relaxing title that it can serve as a palate cleanser between larger, more involved narrative games.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-snow-fox.jpg?itok=J3mRcWNR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-snow-fox.jpg?itok=sCE2N5eW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The only downfall that I really experienced while playing&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;were the instances of forced perspective when moving through certain areas. Typically, you have complete control over your camera angle, with the ability to look around the immediate environment. At certain points in the game, however, the camera shifts automatically, which can be disadvantageous to what you're trying to view or do at that point in time. This occurs a handful of times and may not be a bother to all players, but is something you may want to consider.</p>
<p><em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is a fully realized story with interesting characters, easy to grasp <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="20c4837f-e0cc-430f-ba11-3f7a140d6674" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/return-of-3d-platformer"><strong>3D platforming</strong></a> mechanics, and charming environment. Regardless of how long you like your games,&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is one to add to your playlist thanks to its relaxing vibe. It is a title to experience, even for those that normally avoid platforming games.</p>

Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the company is getting ready to test the ability to stream games that you own that aren’t part of the existing Xbox Game Pass library.</p><p>As part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft, the software giant has been readying its Xbox Cloud Gaming servers to be able to support streaming thousands of games. I’m told Microsoft will first test its new Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming capabilities with Xbox Insiders in November, before expanding them to more Xbox users.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion comes the same month Microsoft plans to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app for Android in the US. Microsoft is able to do this thanks to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">court ruling</a> earlier this week that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed yesterday</a> that “starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.” Once Microsoft’s work to enable a full game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming is complete, you’ll be able to purchase an Xbox game on Android and immediately stream it to your device.</p><p>Microsoft first announced it would support your game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159492/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-library-owned-games-feature">in 2022</a>, but it never launched that year. I understand the work has been complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games, instead of the hundreds that currently exist on Xbox Game Pass. While thousands of games will soon be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I’m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">originally planning to launch in July</a>. The store will initially include deals and in-game items but will grow to cover first-party games eventually.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">Microsoft said in August</a>&nbsp;that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and that “work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p><div>

Taking influence from Sony’s <em>Uncharted </em>series (itself inspired by the early <em>Tomb Raider</em> games) and adding survival elements, these three titles helped reinvent Lara Croft’s adventures for a more modern audience. The trilogy turned Lara into not only a skilled treasure hunter but also a tough survivor who has seen a lot of shit, as the very first game, which strands Lara on an island full of mercenaries, makes abundantly clear. All three games are extremely solid adventures that blend compelling combat and delightful puzzle solving, but for my money the best of the three is 2015’s <em>Rise</em>. At $14.99 (or $11.98 on Steam), however, you can play the entire trilogy for a bargain. Also of note is that <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em> actually picks up after the events of these games, so if you want to know more about the show’s version of Lara, this trilogy will fill you in.</p><p>Nintendo Switch users won’t be able to take advantage of that deal, but that doesn’t mean they can’t get in on the <em>Tomb Raider</em> fun.

            <title><![CDATA[New Escape from Tarkov Event Wants You To Hunt At Night]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-hunt-at-night/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-escape-from-tarkov-event-wants-you-to-hunt-at-night.1007697/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-hunt-at-night/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov is a challenging enough game as it is, but when you start fooling around at night, it becomes a whole different kettle of fish. Not only do you need to contend with a hail of bullets around every corner, but you also need to battle with suffocating darkness that envelops the map, being guided by moonlight or an incriminating torch beam.</p>



<p>Fans of a daytime raid will hate the newest Tarkov event – it’s designed so that you <strong>must </strong>hunt at night, but the rewards are pretty fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-of-the-cult-in-tarkov">Night of the Cult in Tarkov</h2>



<p>In the last few months, a few quests have popped up focusing on the Cultists that stalk certain maps in the dead of night. This latest challenge is no different.</p>



<p>In Night of the Cult, players must eliminate five ‘hooded night people’, otherwise known as Cultists. You can find Cultists on almost every map:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighthouse</li>



<li>Streets of Tarkov</li>



<li>Night Factory (anywhere)</li>



<li>Customs (ZB-013 extraction)</li>



<li>Woods (near ritual sites)</li>



<li>Shoreline (near Swamp Village and at the resort)</li>



<li>Ground Zero (anywhere)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re able to successfully eliminate five hooded Cultists, you’ll get one hell of a reward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dorm Room 314 Marked Key (5 mil value)</li>



<li>Cult Locust Ballistic Plate</li>



<li>Cult Termite Ballistic Plate</li>



<li>L3Harris GPNVG-18 NVG</li>



<li>12,500 EXP</li>



<li>50,000 roubles</li>
</ul>



<p>If you need to know how to kill Cultists in Tarkov, one key trick will be to <strong>act with caution</strong>. These super agile enemies like to ambush players, and you can’t hear their footsteps, so they’ll sneak up on you as fast as anything. They’re also immune to thermal devices and they have large health pools.</p>



<p>They can use a wide variety of weapons ranging from 7.62 assault rifles to DMRs and handguns, but they’ll almost always try and get close to stab you with a poisoned knife. </p>



<p>Presently, the best place to farm Cultists in Tarkov is on Streets of Tarkov and Ground Zero (LL21 + only). They have a 60% spawn chance on these maps and a 20% spawn chance elsewhere.</p>



<p>Be warned – this is just the beginning of the Halloween-themed Tarkov event. Two heftier tasks follow right after this one. To complete the full line, you’ll need to hunt and kill a whopping 105 Cultists.</p>

          <p>A few years ago, the idea of running PC games on a Mac, in Linux, or on Arm processors would have been laughable. But the developers behind Asahi Linux—the independent project that is getting Linux working on Apple Silicon Macs—have managed to do all three of these things at once.</p>
<p>The feat brings together a perfect storm of open source projects, <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html">according to</a> Asahi Linux GPU lead Alyssa Rosenzweig: the FEX project to translate x86 CPU code to Arm, the Wine project to get Windows binaries running on Linux, DXVK and the Proton project to translate DirectX 12 API calls into Vulkan API calls, and of course the Asahi project's Vulkan-conformant driver for Apple's graphics hardware.</p>
<p>Games are technically run <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/muvm">inside a virtual machine</a> because of differences in how Apple Silicon and x86 systems address memory—Apple's systems use 16 KB memory pages, while x86 systems use 4 KB pages, something that causes issues for Asahi and some other Arm Linux distros on <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Broken-Software">a regular basis</a>&nbsp;and a gap that the VM bridges.</p>

      You'd never guess that this was the Windows version of <em>Fallout 4</em> running on a Mac that was running Linux.

          <p>There comes a point in most experienced Steam shoppers' lives where they wonder what would happen if their account was canceled or stolen, or perhaps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">they just stopped breathing</a>. It's scary to think about how many games in your backlog will never get played; scarier, still, to think about how you don't, in most real senses of the word, own any of them.</p>
<p>Now Valve, seemingly working to comply with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426">a new California law</a> targeting "false advertising" of "digital goods," has added language to its checkout page to confirm that thinking. "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam," the Steam cart now tells its customers, with a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement further below.</p>

<p><a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">California's AB2426 law</a>, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom Sept. 26, excludes subscription-only services, free games, and digital goods that offer "permanent offline download to an external storage source to be used without a connection to the internet." Otherwise, sellers of digital goods cannot use the terms "buy, purchase," or related terms that would "confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good." And they must explain, conspicuously, in plain language, that "the digital good is a license" and link to terms and conditions.</p>

However, unlike the guns available in Echoes, Exuviae isn't craftable--so to get your preferred rolls, you're going to need to keep farming more versions of the gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Exuviae is a possible drop from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-onslaught-salvation-guide-potions-banes-and-new-defenses/2900-5849/" data-ref-id="2900-5849">Revenant's Onslaught: Salvation activity</a>. It can come out of reward chests you earn as you work through waves in the mode, but as in the original Onslaught activity, you can also "attune" your rewards to make Exuviae more likely to pop out of those chests. To do that, you need to unlock Tonic recipes in Eido's Apothecary. Taking an Enriching Tonic that focuses on the Exuviae hand cannon will boost how often you get it as a reward from Onslaught for 20 minutes, but you'll first need to get the right recipe. <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=2d6e30c3020bd0f5JmltdHM9MTcyODYwNDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNWQ0MGViMC00MWEwLTY1ZGEtMGM0Yi0xZDE2NDA0ZTY0ZDImaW5zaWQ9NTE4NA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=05d40eb0-41a0-65da-0c4b-1d16404e64d2&amp;psq=tonics+guide+gamespot.com&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXNwb3QuY29tL2dhbGxlcnkvZGVzdGlueS0yLXJldmVuYW50LXRvbmljcy1ndWlkZS1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LW1vcmUtdG9uaWMtcmVjaXBlcy1hbmQtZmllbGR3b3JrLzI5MDAtNTg1My8&amp;ntb=1">Check out our Tonics guide</a> to see how to do that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4383353-20241011110629_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383353" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4383353-20241011110629_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383353"></a><figcaption>Exuviae</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4383353-20241011110629_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Exuviae_God_Rolls">Exuviae God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Exuviae_PvP_God_Roll">Exuviae PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +5, Range +5</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Keep Away  <ul><li dir="ltr">Increases reload, range, and accuracy when no enemies are in close proximity.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Precision Instrument  <ul><li dir="ltr">Dealing sustained damage increases precision damage</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Stability</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The power of Exuviae in PvP is in its high effective range.

With a lot of range and Keep Away active, you'll ideally be engaging other players from distances where they struggle to be as effective as you, and especially if you're accurate, you should knock out other Guardians pretty quickly.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Exuviae_PvE_God_Roll">Exuviae PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flared Magwell  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Reload Speed +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Rimestealer  <ul><li dir="ltr">Destroying a Stasis crystal or defeating a frozen enemy with this weapon grants you Frost Armor.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Headstone  <ul><li dir="ltr">Precision final blows spawn a Stasis crystal at the target's location.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Exuviae carries some seriously useful Stasis synergy, although it relies greatly on landing precision kills to create Stasis crystals as much as possible. The combination of Headstone and Rimestealer is a pretty powerful one: Whenever you use Exuviae to break a Stasis crystal or kill a frozen enemy, you get Frost Armor, making you tougher to kill as a result. Stasis crystals themselves are pretty powerful right now, so this is a gun that can do good work synergizing with a Stasis build and keeping you protected. Amp up its stability stat to make those precision hits a little easier, and boost Handling when possible for fast switches to secondary weapons like grenade launchers.</p>

"Post Void is a masterpiece of compulsive motion and hypnotic, irresistible sounds," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/post-void-review">wrote Sin</a> of YCJY Games's "orgiastic" shooter. "It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/keep-driving">Keep Driving</a> seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and <em>slightly</em> ominous 2D management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

The whole thing seems very spaced-out, for all the excess of menus, but there's the suggestion that Life Lessons of some kind await. "Remember to take it easy," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/">the Steam page</a> remarks, in the manner of somebody smiling and noddling at a toddler to stop them looking at the mushroom cloud behind them. "You're young. You have time."</p>
<p>The game's influences run a boisterous gamut: "Oregon Trail II, FTL, Two Lane Blacktop, Paris Texas, Jalopy, Gloom Haven, The 7th Continent, and the developer's lives". But it all comes together beautifully on the screen, with artfully worn and dusty pixelart backdrops and a catchy inside-outside effect, whereby you're both peering over the dashboard <em>and</em> watching yourself drive. Ah, swish. Here are some bulletpoints:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A procedurally generated pixel art world to explore one road at a time.
</p>
<p>
A nostalgic early 2000s setting with an emphasis on the analogue .
</p>
<p>
Use turn-based 'combat' to solve situations (like getting stuck behind a tractor).
</p>
<p>
Pick up misfits, oddballs and lost souls as you go.
</p>
<p>
Collect songs and listen to a mix CD of local Swedish indie bands.
</p>
<p>
Multiple endings to unlock when you return to the road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I guess the natural foil for this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, which is similarly preoccupied with the art of car maintenance, but also 3D, post-apocalyptic and paranormal. If you enjoy swapping stories with strangers on the road, but think horseless carriages are for chumps, maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>.

A lone piece of concept art shows shadowy figures in a cave pointing to golden rays of light. </p><p>Then there was Dark Math Games. This studio is working on a “true detective RPG” called <em>XXX Nightshift</em>. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Steam page</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an actual trailer</a></span>. It claims a headcount of roughly 20 people, about half of which reportedly worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em>.

It also includes ZA/UM writer Dora Klindžić, who had been working with Tuulik on the direct sequel at that studio up until the mass layoffs earlier this year. </p><p> “I’ve seen good work done at ZA/UM,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Sports Illustrated</em></a></span> at the time. “I’ve also seen management and production staff terrorizing creatives, lying, playing power games, turning people against each other, destroying relationships and people’s self-esteem.” She added, “The mask has slipped from the face of capital. What remains at ZA/UM is a cold, careless company where managers wage war against their own creatives, where artistry is second to property, and where corporate strategy is formed by an arrogant disdain for their own audience.”</p><p>In keeping with that sentiment, Summer Eternal is also launching as an art collective and seeking to re-engage with artists, designers, and others who previously worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em> as well as others. The group’s website lays out its manifesto, artistic vision, and studio setup which is a worker-owned co-op. It sounds like it’s still in the earliest stages of figuring out what its first RPG will be. </p><p> “I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking,” Tuulik wrote in a press release. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged — for five fucking years I’ve been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind — let’s do it fresh from the start, but this time let’s not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.” </p><p>It’s unclear how this will all shakeout. We likely won’t see finished games from many of these teams for at least a couple of years. At ZA/UM, meanwhile, the only remaining projects appear to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Disco Elysium</em> mobile spin-off</a></span> and a completely unrelated RPG set in an entirely new fictional world. Robert Kurvitz, the original creator, seems to have his own studio, Red Info, but it’s unclear what it’s up to at the moment. He delivered a talk over the summer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqYGh078W0I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqYGh078W0I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on how to build worlds in video games</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming understands that a Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition is in development. Its content will be sold as a separate DLC for those with the existing game.</p>



<p>The Definitive Edition is said to have around 10-15 hours of additional content, with a new story quest, side quests, activities, and outfits. </p>



<p>Details on when the edition and/or DLC will be released and its price are still in flux. Still, some sources have suggested that it could be released in 2025 to bolster Warner Bros.’s diminishing gaming revenue following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weak performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. It’s been suggested that the DLC will be between $20 and $30.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was released at the beginning of 2023 and, as of January 2024, sold over 24 million copies. The game is still in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 10 best-selling games in 2024 in the US</a> at number 10.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels&nbsp;said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a successor to Hogwarts Legacy</a> “is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road.” So there’s still a lot of time to wait for those looking forward to a sequel.</p>



<p>As for when the Definitive Edition/DLC will be announced, it remains to be seen, but with a potential 2025 release date on the cards, it could be sooner rather than later.</p>

This TSA-approved portable battery features a generous 20,000mAH capacity and a powerful 100W charging rate with Power Delivery 3.0 and PPS. It's the perfect backup for a Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally. Baseus hasn't been long around enough to develop the same reputation as Anker, but its power banks have been steadily racking up favorable reviews and recommendations. They're also a lot less expensive than a comparable Anker power bank. </p><h2>Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Power Bank for $49.79</h2><p><em><strong>Amazon Prime member exclusive</strong></em></p><div id="206554" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Amazon Prime Member Exclusive</p></div><p><h3>Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W USB Power Pank with PD 3.0 and PPS</h3></p><div><p>Clip the 10% off coupon on the product page</p></div></div><p>The Baseus Blade features a slim and lightweight form factor that measures only 0.7 inches thin and weighs in at 17 ounces. It has four ports: two USB Type-C ports and two USB Type-A ports. The USB Type-C ports deliver a combined total of 100W of power output (charging your devices) and 65W of power input (charging your power bank). The USB Type-A ports deliver up to 18W. The power bank can be brought onto airplaines since it is well below TSA's 27,000mAh threshold. Despite the thin profile, the Baseus Blade is able to pack in a digital readout that displays a lot of useful real-time information like remaining battery capacity, power input, and power output from each port.</p><h3>The Baseus Blade can fast charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally</h3><p>This is a great charger for gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Switch. Both the ROG Ally and Steam Deck suffer from a short battery life when gaming on the go. During our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-review">Steam Deck review</a>, we found games like God of War or Spider-Man would tap out in under two hours. At the end of the day, you'll never get the full potential out of your Steam Deck or ROG Ally if you're not equipped with a decent portable charger. The Baseus Blade can fast charge all three at their maximum rate. It supports up to 100W of charging over USB-C, which is more than enough for the Steam Deck's charging rate of 38W, the Rog Ally's charging rate of 65W, and the Nintendo Switch's charging rate of 18W. </p><h3>The Baseus Blade can <u>fully</u> charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally</h3><p>The ROG Ally and Steam Deck both consume about 40Whr going from full to empty. The Baseus Blade has a 20,000mAh capacity or 74Whr battery. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, then you should expect the Baseus Blade to charge either gaming handheld about <strong>1.5 times</strong>. That's why it's better to get a larger capacity like this than a 10,000mAh power bank, which cannot charge these handhelds from empty to full even once.</p><h3>Looking for more deals?</h3><p>This is easily one of the best  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-steam-deck-deals">Steam Deck deals</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">Nintendo Switch deals</a> available right now, and absolutely worth considering if you find yourself short on power all too often.

    <p><span>Today's third Disco Elysium staff offshoot.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Summer Eternal" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/summer-eternal">Summer Eternal</a>, today’s third new studio of former <em>Disco Elysium</em> developers, has announced its establishment. Described as an “art collective / <a title="Genres > RPG [16,701 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> studio,” the developer aims to gather author, writers, and designers who worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em>, as well as new talent, to create something “completely fresh and original.” <span id="more-920990"></span></p><p>“I believe that the last time around, we made something genre-breaking,” said studio co-founder and <em>Disco Elysium</em> writer Argo Tuulik in a press release. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged—for five fucking years I’ve been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind—let’s do it fresh from the start, but this time let’s not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.”</p><p>According to the studio, the goal of Summer Eternal is to create a worker-owned, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [205 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>, and liberating space that ensures that every worker, every creative, and every player has a voice.</p><p>Some of the studio’s staff members include:</p><ul><li>Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina, who were among the five writers of <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</li><li>Lenval Brown, who is a voice actor known for his voice work on <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</li><li>Dora Klindzic, who was a principal writer at <a title="Companies > ZA/UM [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/za-um">ZA/UM</a>.</li><li>Anastasia Ivanova, who was a senior concept artist at ZA/UM.</li><li>Michael Oswell, who was the graphic designer at ZA/U.</li><li>Aleksandar Gavrilovic, who was the managing director of game developer studio Gamechuck.</li><li>Plus more to be announced in the coming weeks.</li></ul><p>Tuulik continued, “Honesty, transparency and true equality to the best of our abilities is what we vow to adhere to in our relentless pursuit of artistic highs and social change. Paraphrasing Noam Chomsky, the goal here is to, ‘All the world over, back the masses against the classes.’ We invite you to judge us by our <a title="Genres > Action [2,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s not our words. You *should* question our integrity and scrutinize our methods, ’cause many a moneyman will put on a ‘Sex Pistols’ shirt to tap into punk chicks. Ask to see our hearts and hold them up against the light.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267818/thrustmaster-racing-sim-wheel-t598-sony-playstation-direct-axial-drive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thrustmaster has announced a new <a href="https://www.thrustmaster.com/en-us/products/t598/">steering wheel base</a> that makes the company’s direct drive technology available on consoles for the first time. It also introduces a new electric motor design — already in use on high-end hybrid sports cars like the <a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/auto/sf90-stradale">Ferrari SF90</a> — to the world of sim racing, improving realism while also shrinking the hardware.</p><p>The Thrustmaster T598 can be preordered today for $499.99 (including a set of racing pedals) and will be available starting on October 19th. Although it is compatible with both PCs and consoles, it’s limited for use with only the PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>Direct drive sim racing wheel bases are often preferred by enthusiasts because the steering wheel is connected directly to an electric motor, instead of using gears or belts, producing more torque, which creates more convincing feedback effects for a driver.</p><p>Wheel bases using a direct drive system typically rely on radial flux motors, but they come with some drawbacks. Their design tends to be larger to help dissipate excess heat that’s generated, and because the steering wheel shaft rotates perpendicular to the motor’s magnetic field, it creates occasional moments of drag. That can produce a sensation known as “cogging” where a steering wheel feels like it’s jerking as it’s turned.</p><div><figcaption><em>The steering wheel included with the T598 can be easily swapped out.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Thrustmaster</cite></p></div><p>Racing sims will compensate for cogging through algorithms that prevent those jerky motions from affecting a vehicle in a game, but Thrustmaster’s T598 solves the problem by instead using an axial flux motor (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/yasa-motors-mercedes-axial-flux-2024/">originally demonstrated by Michael Faraday</a> way back in 1821) with a different design making the magnetic field run parallel with the motion of the steering wheel’s shaft. Thrustmaster says its Direct Axial Drive technology nearly eliminates cogging while the new wheel base delivers five newton-meters of constant torque to increase force feedback effects and responsiveness.</p><p>The T598 wheel base features four buttons and a small screen for adjusting settings and saving or loading user profiles. When used with the included 11.8-inch steering wheel that features magnetic paddle shifters, additional buttons, but no display, the wheel base’s screen can show game details like speed or a racer’s position.</p><p>The new wheel base also comes with a set of Thrustmaster’s Raceline Pedals LTE (Long Term Evolution) that use the company’s proprietary magnetic Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and longevity. The firmness of the pedals can also be adjusted by swapping to a different set of included springs that increase tension.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Epic Games is preparing to launch Fortnitemares 2024, this year's edition of the Halloween event inside Fortnite. The latest gameplay trailer has provided a glimpse at the many collaborations featured in this event, leaving fans very excited about what will go live shortly.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Fortnitemares 2024 begins tomorrow morning after the server maintenance. The event will go live alongside version 31.40 and introduce playable characters from horror movies such as Leatherface from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-never-gonna-give-you-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> and Billy from Saw. Moreover, Edward Scissorhands (from Tim Burton's 1990 masterpiece film) and a couple of Marvel characters (Venom and Mephisto) are also seen. Speaking of gameplay additions coming with Fortnitemares, players can look forward to an explosive pumpkin launcher weapon and Billy's Tricycle vehicle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnitemares 2024 Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g909vB-BSXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Over seven years after its debut, Fortnite Battle Royale continues to run strong, in addition to side games like LEGO Fortnite. Of course, it also helps that the Epic Games Store successfully <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile, with Fortnite once again available in Europe to iOS players.</p>
<p>During the recent Unreal Fest, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-our-company-is-now-financially-sound-gamers-gravitate-towards-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you that Epic is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets, and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong. </em></p>
<p><em>When you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>Fortnite will be a key component even in the upcoming Disney-themed persistent universe that Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> $1.5 billion in. Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a few days ago that players will have the opportunity to move seamlessly from Fortnite to the Disney 'metaverse' and vice versa.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>After a hard day's editing articles about three Disco Elysium spiritual successors - each <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">more</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">politically</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">outspoken</a> than the last, in a kind of Sophisticated Pooh collage of escalating Marxism - I like to kick back with a nice chill game about Lovecraftian space monsters. </p>
<p>That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.</p><!--more-->
<p>In Starless Abyss you play a Proxima, the possibly-human agent of a motley crew of scientists and occultists called Counter Horror. There are five Proximas in all, each with different skills and attributes. There are over 160 cards to discover, divided between six faction groupings, and each campaign run spans three acts with several randomly selected bosses. Visually, it's a writhing pixelart buffet of toothy tentacles and flying eyeballs and spacetime rifts, set to menacing chipset. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's a touch more detail on how you'll and expand and tune up your fleet. This being a labour of Lovecraft, it's of no huge surprise to learn that you can prevail over the monsters by driving yourself absolutely mad.</p>
<blockquote><p>Start your run playing 'Lucid Proxima' and command a fleet of ships through battle across the universe. Successful missions reward you with new artifacts to upgrade your ships, D.I.C.E to help sway pivotal moments between missions or cards from different factions, which can be collected, combined and combo-ed to help destroy the eldritch beasts. Beware though! The closer you get to the ultimate Outer Gods, the more your Proxima's sanity depletes. Or embrace your insanity and harness the power of the occult using annihilating Ritual Cards to take down your opposition. </p></blockquote>
<p>It's out in 2025 - here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167970/Starless_Abyss/">the Steam page with more</a>. I'm kind of burned out on sci-fi deckbuilders after Breachway, but as a Homeworld: Cataclysm cultist, I do like me some cosmic body horror in space. If you like the cut of these screaming entrails, may I also recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169930/Rtype_Tactics_I_o_II_Cosmos/">R-Type Tactics</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tuulik was part of the punk collective that grew from this group of friends to the studio that delivered <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium"><u>Disco Elysium</u></a> to critical acclaim and commercial success almost five years ago to this day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/disco-1728654712065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Disco Elysium. Image credit: ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But Tuulik left ZA/UM in acrimonious circumstances after being laid off in February amid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs">what was reportedly the cancelation of a Disco Elysium standalone spin-off</a>. On his way out, Tuulik alleged "incompetence and injustice" at the studio.</p><p>Tuulik told IGN he’s starting a “revolutionary new RPG studio” and has got a number of key disco Elyisum developers to join his cause. Here’s the makeup of the studio as it stands today, October 11, with more people said to be coming on board in the coming weeks.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina, who were among the five writers of Disco Elysium</li><li>Lenval Brown, a voice actor known for his voice work on Disco Elysium</li><li>Dora Klindžić, who was a principal writer in ZA/UM</li><li>Anastasia Ivanova, who was a senior concept artist in ZA/UM</li><li>Michael Oswell, who was the graphic designer at ZA/UM</li><li>And Aleksandar Gavrilović, who was the managing director of game developer studio Gamechuck</li></ul><p>It’s worth noting that neither Robert Kurvitz, the lead writer and designer of Disco Elysium and founding member of ZA/UM, nor Aleksander Rostov, who was art director on Disco Elysium, are currently involved with either Summer Eternal, Dark Math Games, Longdue Games, Red Info (see below), or ZA/UM itself. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>Both were fired from ZA/UM</u></a> in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, and are now reportedly making a new game of their own at a studio called Red Info, which is backed by Chinese internet company NetEase.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves...</p></div><p>“We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising ‘the next Disco Elysium’ are popping up every hour on the hour,” read a statement from Summer Eternal.</p><p>“It’s a sure sign that the fifth anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.</p><p>“However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalized for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused… But it is all of us – the creatives, the workers, the players – who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day.</p><p>“Therefore, we announce today our own vision of a worker-owned co-operative, a complex structure that will ensure that not only moneylenders but every worker, every creative, even every player, has a seat at the table.”</p><p>Summer Eternal has opened the doors to its <a href="https://summereternal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, which contains a manifesto for game development that wouldn’t be out of place in Disco Elysium itself and word of an incoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>“I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking,” Tuulik said. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged — for five fucking years I've been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind — let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops.</p></div><p>That choice quote above is a reference to ZA/UM’s high-profile collapse following the release of Disco Elysium back in 2019. Some background for the uninitiated: Disco Elysium is a narrative role-playing game developed and published by controversial studio ZA/UM. Gameplay revolves around navigating dialogue trees rather than combat, with each of the 24 skills representing a different aspect of the amnesiac detective protagonist's abilities and thoughts. The player is free to support or suppress his ideologies as they work through the story. Disco Elysium is considered by some among the greatest video games ever made.</p><p>It went on to enjoy enormous success, winning numerous game of the year awards and selling millions of copies. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-tv-adaptation-announced-from-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-producer"><u>TV series adaptation deal</u></a> followed, as did the release of an expanded version of the game featuring full voice acting and new content subtitled The Final Cut. A follow-up seemed all but guaranteed, but after high-profile staff exits and subsequent messy legal tussles brought ZA/UM to its knees, what might have turned out to be a Disco Elysium sequel was canceled.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>XXX NIGHTSHIFT Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Fast forward to today, October 11, 2024, and the cusp of Disco Elysium’s five-year anniversary, and we now have multiple spin-off studios laying claim to the spiritual successor throne. One of these, Dark Math Games' XXX NIGHTSHIFT, is a 'true detective RPG' that looks remarkably similar to Disco Elysium, even down to the isometric perspective and dialogue text that moves up the right-hand side of the screen as the player makes choices and hears voice actors bring a narrator and the protagonist’s internal monologue to life.</p><p>When asked how he felt about this rapid-fire emergence of new Disco Elysium spin-off studios all saying they're making spiritual successors, Tuulik told IGN: “You know the scene from Lord of the Rings, where Arwen is taking Frodo to Rivendell with the ringwraiths giving chase horseback and right before the river scene you finally see all nine ride together to stop Frodo? It's kind of like that.”</p><p>So what, exactly, is Summer Eternal building? Tuulik says it has a complex structure involving co-operatives with not only full time workers but also freelancers and part-time collaborators, and even a player-ownership of a game studio aspect. It will take some time to set up, he said. There are no assets for the video game Summer Eternal is working on, but Tuulik did tell IGN about it in vague terms. In short, it's "definitely not a Disco Elysium sequel," but it will be a role-playing game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/screenshot-2024-10-11-151300-1728656077537.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Summer Eternal's website presents visits with a clip of a prairie fire. Image credit: Summer Eternal.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"What I can say is that here in Summer Eternal we share a belief that role-playing games are the pinnacle expression of current human culture - something every other discipline can contribute," Tuulik said. "Art-form of the century. And we have found a way to combine role-playing with serious, funny, moving, narratives in a way that allows us artists to express ourselves in a unprecedented way. When one day I'll come to you with news of something, it will be a role-playing game."</p><p>"It will definitely not be a Disco Elysium sequel!" Tuulik continued. "It is time to break away from the past and start a new chapter. It will be a completely new setting and story with new mechanics. But end of the day we are who we are and RPGs are what we will make - do what you will with it :)"</p><p>Tuulik even had a message for his former colleagues (“comrades”) at ZA/UM, including Kurvitz and Rostov:</p><p>“To all other former respected comrades (Kurvitz, Rostov, everyone) – long time no hear, but we would love for you to join the struggle as well: time to roll up our sleeves and start building communism!”</p><p>As for ZA/UM, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs"><u>reportedly canceled a standalone expansion for Disco Elysium back in February</u></a>, leaving several staff members at risk of losing their jobs.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In case you skipped the Guardian Games earlier this year and never got one, these will be available at the squid-faced merchant's store.

It comes in handy during dangerous moments, but the stats here are quite low almost across the board. Intellect and mobility get most of the available stat points, but you'll have some big gaps in your defense if you decide to roll with this particular version of the helmet.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3>Helm of Saint-14 (Exotic Titan helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383242-destiny22024-10-1119-05-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383242" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383242-destiny22024-10-1119-05-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383242"></a><figcaption>Helm of Saint-14</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383242-destiny22024-10-1119-05-29.jpg"></figure><p>For the Titan who likes to be the best line of defense, Helm of Saint-14 is great. If you have your Ward of Dawn Super active, enemies who enter it will be blinded, while allies who pass through it get a weapon damage boost. If you use the Sentinel Shield Super, guarding with this ability will blind nearby targets. The stats on this roll emphasize building around your Super, as you get great resilience and intellect alongside a solid recovery stat. Strength and discipline are a bit low on this Exotic, so you'll need to use some armor mods to bring them up to speed, but mobility is thankfully minimized for a Titan.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3>Felwinter's Helm (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383243-destiny22024-10-1119-05-43.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383243" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383243-destiny22024-10-1119-05-43.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383243"></a><figcaption>Felwinter's Helm</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383243-destiny22024-10-1119-05-43.jpg"></figure><p>Powered melee finals will create a burst of energy that weakens enemies when you equip the Felwinter's Helm Exotic. Finishers and final blows against powerful targets also increase the size of the burst and the weakening effect, so this is an interesting Exotic to build around if you're looking to get up close and personal with enemies. The stats are another story, as this Exotic has terrible strength and recovery numbers. Intellect is pretty good, but mobility is unnecessarily high for a Warlock and recovery is almost non-existent. With the right build, Felwinter's Helm is pretty powerful, but feel free to give this version of the Exotic a skip this week.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 10</li><li

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn bonus Strange Coins from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

Ahead of new California legislation requiring storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it, Steam has implemented a message at the point of purchase doing just that.
</p>
<p>
California's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/buying-digital-games-means-youre-just-purchasing-a-license-california-will-force-storefronts-to-admit">new legislation</a>, which was signed into law by governor Gavin Newsom at the end of September, is intended to make consumers more aware of the sometimes-temporary nature of digital ownership. It explicitly prohibits sellers from using the words "buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good" - instead requiring them to display a "clear and conspicuous statement" explaining the nature of their transaction.
</p>
<p>
And while the legislation, officially known as <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">AB 2426</a>, doesn't formally comes into effect until next year, Valve has already tweaked Steam's shopping cart to highlight customers are buying a license - with the changes being displayed internationally, including in the UK. Steam's shopping cart now features a short message below the 'Continue to payment' button, reading, "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam." That's followed by a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, containing additional information.

California's new legislation doesn't apply to games offered as part of a subscription service, to games "sold" or given away for free, or to games that can be downloaded and played permanently offline. That hasn't stopped GOG, a storefront known for its commitment to DRM-free games, from getting a bit cheeky in light of Steam's changes.
</p><p>
"Since checkout banners are trending," the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">post on social media</a>, "we're thinking of putting one up ourselves." It included a GOG shopping cart mockup appended with a new message of its own: "A purchase of a digital product on GOG grants you its Offline Installers, <strong>which cannot be taken away from you</strong>."

Legislation AB 2426 follows several high profile instances of games being yanked from owners' libraries in recent times. Ubisoft made headlines earlier this year after it began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">quietly revoking players' licenses to The Crew</a>, and PlayStation opted to withdraw access to PS5 shooter Concord (albeit while providing refunds) after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">announcing it was shutting servers down</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controversy caused by Ubisoft's decision in particular led to revitalised discourse around video games preservation, and the establishment of Stop Killing Games - an initiative aiming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">mount political and legal challenges</a> to the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable. And while legislation such as AB 2426 doesn't fix the issue at its root, it does at least seek to better inform consumers ahead of a purchase.
