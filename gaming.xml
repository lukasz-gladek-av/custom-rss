<p>Fans have been speculating about the prospect of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> remaster/remake for quite some time now, and interestingly, the book actually somehow teases and debunks such a concept in one go.</p>
<p>The following quote from Tanabe regarding Echoes' multiplayer mode seemingly confirms that a remake isn't in development, and nor is it currently being planned. But at the same time, it kind of reads like a bit of a tease, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Retro completed the multiplayer mode without compromising on quality even under such challenging conditions. Being of its time, it was designed for local play, so the number of players who actually experienced it might not have been very large. If it is remade, I would be delighted for more people to have the chance to experience it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gosh, who knows... Either way, it's seems likely at this point that we won't be seeing anything of the sort until well after the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which drops on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd sure love to see it, though. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a> while you're at it please, Nintendo!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest beat-em-up game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> developer, Tribute Games, and publisher Dotemu, finally has a release date after its reveal at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest </a>earlier this year. It'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on December 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The news came with a new release date trailer showing off more of Tribute Games' pixel art and the classic gameplay beat-em-up fans love, while also showcasing some of the 15 playable heroes that'll be in the game when it arrives.</p>



<p>Specifically, the trailer revealed Phoenix and Iron Man as playable characters joining the roster. The rest of the playable characters include Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Captain America, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Black Panther, and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a classic beat-em-up style game with a few unique twists, including Tribute Games' Cosmic Swap system, where you'll switch between two characters while playing to address whatever the situation in front of you calls for, making use of one character's abilities over another when they're better suited for the fight.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of upgrades to use, and with the roster of 15 characters, plenty of ways to mix-and-match characters to suit your own playstyle. </p>



<p>Tribute Games has made a name for itself as the studio to follow if you like good beat-em-up games, and there's no sign that this will be anything less than the quality the studio has already delivered with previous titles, specifically TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have announced the release date for their upcoming star-studded superhero brawler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, and it won't be long before you get to check it out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, which was first announced as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show earlier this year</a>, will be launching across PC and consoles on December 1st.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the two studios have also announced the two final characters to round out the game's 15-fighter-strong roster: Phoenix and Invincible Iron Man. They join a lineup that also includes iconic characters like Venom, Spider-Man, Storm, and Wolverine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date-phoenix-iron-man.jpg?itok=Z3NcFVem 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date-phoenix-iron-man.jpg?itok=oH26KpMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s two final fighters are Phoenix and Invincible Iron Man.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, it's a side-scrolling beat-'em-up developed by Tribute Games, the folks behind 2022's&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em>&nbsp;(of which our Alex <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review" rel="nofollow">was a big fan</a>).</p>

<p>Published by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/absolum-200k-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>outfit Dotemu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>sees Marvel heroes banding together to fight the villainous Annihilus (the clue's in the name, I suppose), who's "launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy".</p>

<p>You'll choose a team of two Marvel heroes, swapping between them as necessary and creating "unique team-ups" to deal "devastating damage" to your foes.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>supports co-op play for up to four players, and you can play either locally or online. Drop-in-drop-out co-op is supported as well, so if you can't enjoy the entire adventure alongside the same people, it's no big deal.</p>




<p>Each player chooses their own team of two heroes, too, so you may well have up to eight heroes battling through the streets of New York towards the sinister-sounding Negative Zone to defeat Annihilus.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012545" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-cosmic-invasion/9n79tqtztqq4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch (although not for Switch 2, it seems) on December 1st. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator 2 Roadmap Promises New Crossover DLC and More]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap-promises-new-crossover-dlc-and-more.1331857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FuturLab has revealed the first&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and if you're a fan of the franchise's crossover DLC, then you'll be pleased by what's in store for the next year or so.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/517476466977407328" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>has three packs of "paid IP DLC" on the way, with one due to launch in each of the first three quarters of 2026.</p>

<p>It's not clear which IPs these DLCs will revolve around, but&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>has teamed up with some pretty big names in the past, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, plus more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap-40k-dlc-powerwash-1.jpg?itok=15E-Pn14 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap-40k-dlc-powerwash-1.jpg?itok=GhDEZQ8N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>'s "IP DLC" be as big as its&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>collaboration?</figcaption></figure><p>The paid DLC packs will be arriving in conjunction with a host of free content, including three jobs forming part of the game's "Caldera Chronicles" series, as well as plenty of new features, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>FuturLab says that for the rest of the year, it's focusing on these fixes and QOL improvements, and that its top priority at the moment is to "get key bindings back into the game", so hopefully, your&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>experience should improve soon.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, it's the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, offering much the same gameplay experience as its predecessor (albeit with some extra bells and whistles to make things more exciting).</p>

<p>You'll once again be let loose on a variety of filthy environments and asked to clean them with your power washer, but you've also got access to new tools like an abseiling rig, a powerful new surface cleaner, and a cherry picker.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-2-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. While you wait for the roadmap's content to be delivered, why not take a trip down memory lane and read our very own Blair's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review" rel="nofollow">review of the first game</a>?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Scarface: The World Is Yours Steam Release Canceled Over "Unexpected Complications"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/scarface-world-is-yours-steam-port-taken-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-release-canceled-over-unexpected-complications.1331854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A recent Steam port of 2006 action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>has been taken down by publisher EC Digital owing to what the studio describes as "unexpected complications and concerns".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4113570/discussions/0/594037660640685944/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, EC Digital says that "certain builds" of the game were released on "other platforms", and that this release was "unintended", so the studio feels it's "necessary to pause and reevaluate" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours</em>' re-release.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Steam page for the game was "initially intended as a placeholder" while EC Digital worked through what it calls "ongoing licensing and technical matters". The company also points to something it mysteriously calls "urgent discussions with multiple parties concerning the project's status".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-boat.jpg?itok=DsZhJVwa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-boat.jpg?itok=c7TamcIB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The recent Steam re-release of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>was an error, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather confusingly, the game remains available via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, which is presumably one of the "other platforms" on which its release caused this trouble in the first place. It's not clear why the game has been removed from Steam, but not from Epic.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/19-years-later-scarface-game-mysteriously-resurfaces-on-steam-and-epic-but-not-for-long-weve-recently-entered-urgent-discussions-with-multiple-parties-concerning-the-projects-status/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesRadar</a>, however, the re-release of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>contains two mods created by community members, both of which are intended to enhance the original Windows version and make it playable on modern systems.</p>

<p>One of the modders, Silent, who created the eponymous SilentPatch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:x6zaxkp46jrfqieaczwuc4il/post/3m3rcwjmhps2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> they weren't contacted about&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours</em>' re-release on PC.</p>

<p>The author of FusionFix, the other mod included in this re-release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cookieplmonster.bsky.social/post/3m3rv3y5bqs2r" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was contacted</a>, but&nbsp;Silent says it's unlikely the original&nbsp;<em>Scarface&nbsp;</em>IP holders are aware of this new version. In short, this seems like a pretty big mess, and I'd be amazed if the game re-appears on PC storefronts following this debacle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-car.jpg?itok=LlSVbCTa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-car.jpg?itok=QttEYXfq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new PC port of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>is suspicious, to say the least.</figcaption></figure><p>EC Digital doesn't appear to have any other games published under its name on Steam, so I think it's fair to say this re-release is suspect, to say the least. It sounds as though the publisher may not have acquired the appropriate licenses or talked to the right people before going ahead with this.</p>

<p>In any case, if you do want to check out this PC port of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours</em>...well, it's technically available via the Epic Games Store, but I'd save my money and wait for more concrete confirmation of the port's legitimacy if I were you.</p>

            <p>If the interstellar equivalent of scrabbling around under the sofa for loose change or dragging a slightly rusty bumper out of a scrapyard is something you yearn for, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s latest update sounds right up your slightly grimy alley. It's dubbed Breach and adds in a bunch of mysterious shipwrecks to strip for new parts you can then glue to your own vessel. High stakes recycling, basically.</p>

<p>"In Breach, players will traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and on their travels encounter the abandoned remains of ill-fated corvette ships, all ripe for scavenging ship modules to add to your corvette-building arsenal, read the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">update's notes</a>. "Excavating these wrecks will yield an array of corvette pieces including rare vertical parts which unlock a whole new range of build configurations for the more creative designers." Some Atlas-themed bits are also out there for you to ping off with your laser and pocket.</p>
<p>As usual with these free updates to the space sim, there's a limited-time expedition to head out on. it looks to revolve around a the wreck of the Fireship Arcadia, with a trip to the edge of space and some general mysteriousness teased. "Many such wrecks have begun to appear throughout the far reaches of space, and there are rewards for the bravest of Travellers prepared to scavenge from them, including new vertical and structural parts which allow players to build colossal ships and rare, glowing Atlas-themed wings, engines and features," the notes say.</p><p>For those keen to know exactly what sorts of extra ship bits have been added in as par of this broadening of ship building horizons, Hello Games list landing gear, shields, weapons, and connectors, plus some "highly-requested wedge-shaped modules" so people can get a bit artsy with their builds. I assume by making ships shaped like wedges of cheese. They'd better add in moons made of cheese next, so I can do the dairy double and make Wallace of 'and Gromit' fame proud.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky's Breach update is out now.

              <p><span>Netflix is still playing catch-up after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the runaway success</span></a><span> of its animated musical </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, and that means a lot of the merchandising and collaboration deals that should probably have been in the works a long time ago are still trickling in. We’ve gotten </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crossover</span></a><span>, cast </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>appearances on late-night</span></a><span>, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>limited theatrical run</span></a><span> for people to sing along to all the movie’s bangers. But now, some of the bigger toy manufacturers want in on that Huntr/x hysteria, including Hasbro. Yeah, that probably means dolls, but it also very likely means </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>is about to get another Secret Lair drop in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span>Hasbro and Netflix </span><a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fans-netflix-goes-golden-forging-unprecedented-kpop-demon"><span>announced their new partnership</span></a><span> yesterday, October 21, and say they plan to release “toys, collectibles, games, role-play products and more” featuring Rumi, Mira, and Zoey. The announcement goes on to say that Hasbro is working on “dolls, action figures, accessories, collectibles, playsets, [and] collaborations with co-brands.” That last one is interesting, considering Hasbro also notes a few of its brands, and says it will be “leveraging the strength of its iconic portfolio” for more </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>products. That portfolio includes Hasbro Games (which is making a </span><i><span>Monopoly</span></i><span> board game featuring the characters and iconography from the film), Wizards of the Coast, Nerf, and…Furby. Pushing the image of a Rumi-themed Furby from my mind with the strength of the Honmoon, the brand that is the most interesting in that line-up is Wizards of the Coast, the company behind </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering</span></i><span>. The trading card game has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><span>essentially become </span><i><span>Fortnite: The Card Game</span></i></a> <span>with its myriad crossovers and collaborations bringing characters and artwork from properties like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><i><span>Sonic</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-playstation-last-of-us-god-of-war-ellie-2000629350"><span>PlayStation Studios’ portfolio</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817"><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i></a><span> to its booster packs.</span></p> <p><span>While the actual </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>community is pretty split on WOTC’s focus on crossovers, people who don’t play the game, like myself, are more likely to get in a digital queue for a Secret Lair drop if it has characters we know. I have the Shadow the Hedgehog card sitting on my shelf right now. Would I throw down some cash for cards of my demon-slaying queens? Yeah, fucking probably. I played </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>for the first time so I could skydive to “How It’s Done” and headshot some fools. You think I won’t pay money for a high-quality card? I’m a mark. I can complain about the crossover slop all day, but I’m just as bad as anyone. I’ll clap and cheer for cards with bespoke holographic patterns made to look like the Honmoon. You think you’re better than me?

<figure data-uuid="b99caebd7a8e5"><a title="maiden of black water 10th anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b99caebd7a8e5/maiden-of-black-water-10th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of all the horror franchises I've subjected myself to over the years, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame</a> is the one that sticks in my mind most as properly, actually, scary. It's the answer I'll give every single time to the question of what game series has scared me the most, and it's all down to one very simple reason.</p>
<p>As today is the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fatal_frame_maiden_of_black_water">Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</a>'s release in the US, I've been pondering over the series, and in particular its signature camera obscura mechanic. You know, the part that asks you to face your fears, to walk towards the cold spot in the haunted mansion, to enter room 237 of the hotel, and then stay there to take pictures. It's the exact opposite of what my body and brain are telling me to do, messing with my fight or flight response (my doctor says I've got a flight or flight response, to be honest). It gets me every time.</p><div><figure data-videoid="0-dtwj-vs8Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-dtwj-vs8Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0-dtwj-vs8Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-dtwj-vs8Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4023a9tqlxyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>I was a latecomer to this particular franchise; I first tried it in the form of a downloaded fan translation of the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/fatal_frame_iv">Fatal Frame 4: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</a>, but I'd developed an opinion before playing (never a good idea!) based off other people's complaints. And, settling into it on Wii with its motion control awkwardness, I found myself taken aback. "The clunkiness is part of the charm!" I may have exclaimed to myself. Just like the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil">Resident Evil's</a> clunkfest of a setup, the slow to the point of frustration way in which your character moves and controls makes everything even more terrifying. The one complaint I'd heard was something that made it all the more special to me.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I was pretty psyched for Maiden of Black Water; it was my first fully translated experience of this series when it released back in 2015. And it absolutely lived up to everything I wanted and expected from it, whilst once again being...well...being itself. How about we put it that way?</p>
<p>It's still clunky, it's still slow - heck, even the snazzy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_frame_maiden_of_black_water">2021 revamp</a> (which is the version you should 100% play today) remains a stodgy sort of deal, a fact that's cemented it as purposeful in my mind. It's a design decision and they'll never fix it. So all of your complaints about it are null and void to me. Sorry!</p>
<p>In Maiden of Black Water, you're on an absolutely grim trip that splits the action across three interesting protagonists. Each of these leads has a different angle and reasoning for taking their trip to the godawful and miserable Hikami Mountain, which has all the suicide tales, lost souls and dank fog you could ever want. Honestly, fog fanatics will come away satisfied here.</p>

<p>I won't spoil any of the story, but Black Water, as with the rest of the series, has its whole <strong>Ringu</strong> vibe nailed down, and it proceeds to barrel headlong into the most harrowing of back-stories and reasonings for protagonist motivations. You've really gotta beware of that with all these games though, they never hold back, especially when it comes to stuff like suicide. Black Water then adds a new nastiness via a water mechanic that sees you need to stay dry, lest you become afflicted with a curse.</p>
<p>The inherent clunkiness, combined with the utterly relentless bleakness of the mountain setting, make for the perfect place to start scaring the pants off people by having them take out their camera and go looking for trouble in rigidly structured areas of exploration. You know how this part works; use your camera obscura, which is unwieldy and slow to reload as it pops you into first person (it also requires different types of films for different ghouls), and snap a variety of perfectly horrific Japanese ghosts.</p>
<p>The designs of the spirits here are, and always have been, a high point, they're exactly the sort of real-world traditional Japanese style of nightmare fuel that you never, ever want to see, the sort of thing that turns you into a human portaloo in an instant. And instead of having a toilet, you need to stand your ground, get your proper film loaded and snap, or shoot, in such a way that the spirit disperses. It is intense. It gets me every time.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself as eager as ever for more Fatal Frame. I need more of its specific style of clunkiness, more of its terrible haunted locations, and more of those absolutely horrifying ghoul designs.</p>

<p>The 2021 version, which translates its Wii U controller aspects neatly to the console, does a nice job in giving the whole thing a bit of a lift, and the episodic nature of the campaign's brisk 13 hour campaign means that this is one of those lovely things that you can dip into for a bit, make some progress, best a ranking, or whatever suits your fancy.</p>
<p>Honestly, with Halloween coming up, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, if you can swerve the spoilers and embrace the clunk, is well worth your time. Just bring a spare pair of pants.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you go, if you've played them, why not let us know which of the Fatal Frame games is your favourite in this quick and handy poll!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Major news is brewing for Bandai Namco's JRPG series, Tales, confirming several new projects and providing updates on its next mainline entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-tales-series-remasters-are-on-the-way">More Tales Series Remasters Are On The Way</h2>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92001">Ryokutya2089</a>, ahead of the launch of Tales of Xillia Remastered, which will launch on October 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa spoke with Famitsu about the series' future, starting with the future of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-series-remasters-consistently/">Remaster Project.</a></p>



<p>According to the producer, two titles are in development as part of the project, ranging from verification to the final stages of development. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to know which entry in the series will get remastered next, as it will be revealed fairly soon.</p>



<p>In addition, Tomizawa-san confirmed to Famitsu that the Tales of Xillia 2 remaster is still in development. More information on the project will be revealed as soon as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-new-entry-in-the-tales-series-is-still-away-from-reveal">The New Entry in the Tales series Is Still Away From Reveal</h2>



<p>Besides commenting on future series remasters, Tomizawa-san also briefly touched upon the next main entry in the series. This new game is still under development, but it will be a while before it's announced. </p>



<p>Compared to past console generations, where multiple entries in the series were announced and then released in Japan close to one another, this is a radically different approach. Hopefully, the long wait since <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a>, which launched back in 2021, will be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-of-the-series-audience-is-in-the-west">Most of the Series' Audience is in the West</h2>



<p>One interesting tidbit of information shared with Famitsu by Tomizawa-san is that most of the Tales series audience is in the West, over 70%. This is rather surprising, considering how the series was long neglected in North America and Europe with late releases and games that never made the jump.</p>



<p>Among these Japan-exclusive games are the 2D games Tales of Destiny remake and Tales of Rebirth, which are among the best entries in the series. Could either of these games be one of the remasters currently in the works?</p>



<p>Thankfully, those willing to go <span>the extra mile to play any of the Tales games that weren't released in the West via emulation have the chance to experience them in English. L</span>ast year, Life Bottle Productions released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/">Tales of Rebirth English translation patch</a>&nbsp;that also adds new features such as subtitles for animated movies, battle subtitles, and more.</p>

            <p>
It's been more than a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> first launched, and now it seems like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafting game's first proper expansion is right around the corner. Developer Free Range Games shared a new trailer yesterday, which was roughly Durin's Day, a rare Dwarven event in the world of Middle-earth, appropriately revealing the release date for said expansion, Durin's Folk.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a month out in fact, due to be released this coming November 18th, and while there are some details already available for the DLC, there's one slightly odd thing about it: there's no gameplay. There have been a <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/df-expeditions-economy">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/durins-folk-whats-next">blog posts</a>, and even a <a href="https://youtu.be/bpO6AuqqmTw?si=Qgwy5d5bSR24cRc4">podcasty</a> thing all about it, the posts complete with screenshots, but there doesn't appear to be a lick of footage of the thing in motion. Perhaps a point to be concerned about when there's so little time until it arrives; I wouldn't be surprised if it's just not quite ready to be properly shown and the folks at the top of the food chain want a date out to meet some kind of internal target, but that's just conjecture.
</p>

<p>
Still, those details! On the story side of things, you'll be learning about Dwarves from the Fourth Age, and a new end-game story chapter will be there for you to play through. There'll also be NPCs you can rescue and recruit down in the mines, of whom will help you out in your settlement, becoming typically dwarvey things like blacksmiths and brewmasters.
</p><p>
There's some new procedurally generated dungeons to presumably mine and plunder, which can be done alone or in multiplayer. The expansion also lets you explore outside the mountain too, including Durin's Tower, and an area to build some big bases. Lastly, the end-game economy is getting an update, offering up new materials, items, and recipes to unlock lore and other bits.
</p>
<p>
Presumably at some point in the next few weeks a proper trailer will be shown off, but off not, I suppose you'll find out when The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria's Durin's Folk expansion launches on November 18th.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> has revealed its final two characters and its long-awaited release date. The comic book brawler arrives December 1 with Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Phoenix (Jean Grey) rounding out its roster of gorgeously pixel-art-animated superheroes.</p> <p>Dotemu released one last trailer to celebrate the impending launch which includes brief looks at the newly revealed additions and the gang fighting in front of a giant Master Mold Sentinel like the ’90s <em>X-Men</em> cartoon was turned into a <em>Mega Man X</em> spin-off.</p>

  <p>The full roster, for anyone who hasn’t been keeping track at home, includes the 15 following fighters:</p> <ul> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Iron Man</li> <li>Phoenix</li> </ul> <p>There’s a nice range of household names and Marvel back-benchers sporting a variety of different attack styles and abilities. That’s the one thing that the demo, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663">still free to try on Steam</a>, really drives home. Each of these characters plays surprisingly distinctly for a beat ’em up, especially when you account <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">for mid-battle character switching and team-up attacks</a>.</p> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic</em> <em>Invasion</em> is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch 1, and PC.

<p>A new Fortnite PS5 Bundle is rumoured to be available for purchase on Black Friday 2025, with an expected release on November 21. </p>



<p>Fortnite has been receiving a whole bunch of content lately, with their Fortnitemares 2025 event featuring the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most collabs in the event’s history</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat</a> being featured as a mini-boss at the event. Along with this, it seems Fortnite has been working on some exclusive content for the rumoured PS5 bundle. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-flowering-chaos-bundle-for-ps5-will-feature-8-exclusive-cosmetic-items">Fortnite’s Flowering Chaos Bundle for PS5 Will Feature 8 Exclusive Cosmetic Items</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2025-un-nouveau-pack-ps5-avec-une-remise-inedite-serait-en-preparation-60669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, a new PS5 Fortnite Bundle is expected to arrive during Black Friday 2025, just as it did in 2024. The bundle will include a PS5 Slim Standard (with disc drive) Chassis E Console. It will also feature eight exclusive cosmetic items, which are worth 5,000 V-Bucks, and an additional 1,000 V-Bucks for the buyers of the bundle to spend in the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-ps5-fortnite-bundle-pricing-and-availability">New PS5 Fortnite Bundle Pricing and Availability </h2>



<p>As mentioned above, the New Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle is expected to release on November 21, 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Massive Entertainment, the Ubisoft subsidiary studio responsible for games such as The Division and Star Wars Outlaws, has announced that it is laying off a number of employees.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the studio called it a “voluntary career transition program”.</p>



<p><strong>“As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said.</a></p>



<p><strong>“To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.”</strong></p>



<p>Massive Entertainment says that it “remains fully committed to our roadmap and to creating great experiences for players around the world, including The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3. These projects continue with strength, focus, and ambition, and we look forward to sharing more in the future.”</p>



<p>The decision to “realign” comes just after the launch of the Ubisoft-Tencent subsidiary Vantage Studios. That studio, which will oversee the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six Siege franchises, is the first of the company’s planned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff-on-new-creative-houses-ubisoft-structure/">“creative houses.”</a> As of publishing, it’s unclear what the next steps for the creative houses plan will be, and what games will be grouped.</p>



<p>There was no mention of the number of employees impacted by the decision. Insider Gaming has reached out to both Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment for clarification on this “transition program” and how many people will be let go. Should a response be received, it will </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-upon-a-katamari-review.1331770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Miraculously meditative and frantic in equal measure, Once Upon A Katamari scratches the same carnal itch that the rest of the series always has. It delivers relentless charm, a wheeze-laugh-inducing sense of humor, brain chemistry-altering music, and soulfully satisfying-but-simple gameplay in psychedelic technicolor. This time-trotting adventure rolls out the red carpet for The Prince, The King of All Cosmos, The Queen, and their cadre of silly little cousins with flamboyant aplomb. And with more levels and a greater focus on replayability, there’s more Katamari to go around than ever before. The first new mainline Katamari game in 14 years doesn’t try to reinvent the misshapen mass of things you roll around, and that’s fine by me, because Katamari doesn’t need fixing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At first blush, you probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the original Katamari Damacy from 2004 and Bandai Namco’s latest iteration aside from the obvious jump from 480p to 4K. That’s because developer Rengame understood the assignment: Once Upon A Katamari is just as funny, satisfying, joyful, and energetic as the series has always been.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After showing off his juggling skills with a powerful scroll, the godlike King of All Cosmos flings it into the night sky, yet again destroying the heavenly bodies that inhabit it. It’s up to his son, The Prince, and his cousins to go to Earth and roll up everything in sight to make stars and planets to repopulate the sky. It might not make sense if you haven’t played a Katamari game (or, frankly, even if you have), but this setup has proven as reliable as Bowser kidnapping Princess Peach, and serves as a vehicle for some spectacularly funny stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The King, a flamboyant, self-important, all-powerful – though overall benevolent – god who likes to wear really tight pants is beloved by all, even though he talks down to The Prince and his goofy-looking cousins. Making the most of every last syllable of dialogue, I chuckled at least once just about every time he mused on the nature of the universe or paid himself a compliment with his record-scratch-sound voice. Once Upon A Katamari is a masterclass of comedic writing and localization, efficiently using its humor to set up the goal for each level before the rolling starts without ever letting a joke get stale.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once Upon A Katamari is a masterclass of comedic writing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing a level will often reveal a quick and silly scene showing The King or The Queen getting up to some kind of shenanigans, like rolling a bunch of wild west outlaws into a katamari after a standoff that pays homage to The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, or The King catching a giant crab and flinging it into the sky. Even failing a level has some cheek to it, as The King berates you for messing up, softening the sometimes frustrating blow of falling short of the goal. Despite this pervasive sense of humor, it never becomes cloying or overly self-aware, reliably delivering a smile at nearly every turn beyond The King’s pompous monologues. The overworld level-select maps are just as full of funny touches, like cats and dogs wandering around the Ancient Greek agora in Spartan armor or a cow sitting at a campfire like a human, warming its hooves next to its owner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level takes advantage of just how much stuff there is to find within the seemingly chaotic splatter of candy, flowers, statues, lanterns, and TVs that camouflage a subtle, effortless sense of humor and direction within the madness. Tumbleweeds chase cowboys around in circles, titanic Super Sentai-style heroes practice wrestling their moves on kaiju over the horizon, bears and cows prepare for an all-fronts war, and mummies make TV shows underneath the pyramids. Again: madness. But even in the immense, sometimes overwhelming, chaos of each level, every object you can roll up is placed with deliberate care for either comedic effect or a satisfying sequence, like an octopus wreaking havoc on a pirate ship or bottles of soy sauce set up like bowling pins that will quickly push you into the next weight class so you can finally pick up that bowl of ramen in the other room.</p><div id="rank-every-mainline-katamari-game" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Every Mainline Katamari Game</h3><h3>Rank Every Mainline Katamari Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Controlling your designated roller, you’ll whirl your massive ball of stuff around different time periods like the Jurassic period or Edo-era Japan, picking up anything smaller than your dung beetle-like ball. You might start a level the size of a pushpin or matchstick, but you could end it picking up cities or even planets by the end. The classic goal is simply to get your katamari (which literally means clump or mass in Japanese) as big as possible, but sometimes you’ll need to follow special rules. They could be as simple as collecting as many fish as possible, or as complex as only rolling up sweet items while avoiding savory or bitter things like hot sauce or charcoal because the child who asked you to do so wants to eat something sweet after a big meal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what you’re picking up, snowballing your <em>katamari </em>into a bigger and bigger collection of books, cannonballs, eggs, and flatware is oddly cerebral. Tapping into the same inexplicably satisfying, brain-scratching sensation you get from games like Tetris or PowerWash Simulator, there’s a zen-ness to decluttering Japanese palaces, Ice Age caves, and the decks of pirate ships washed in a low-poly-day-glo look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Upon A Katamari’s oddly gripping, maximalist soundscape counters this calm with gusto. Different items snap to your odd ball with a satisfying <em>zhoop</em>, with certain things making unique noises like a wailing cat or a street punk scatting, turning your katamari the strangest chorus you’ve ever heard. As you roll up a ball of various odds and ends, Once Upon A Katamari matches your collection with an equally eclectic soundtrack. Inspired by the poppy hodge-podge sound of J-Pop subgenre Shibuya-kei, Once Upon A Katamari’s soundtrack stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the musical giants it’s following as a spectacular album in its own right, with or without a game to accompany it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The soundtrack stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the musical giants it’s following.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only unifying themes among the notes are paying subtle homage to <em><strong>the </strong></em>Katamari riff (you know: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7EXlS9-XpU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>that catchy one</u></a> that goes na naaa nanana nana na na na na nana naaa) that permanently tattoos itself on your hippocampus after playing any game in this series. Otherwise, Once Upon A Katamari’s soundtrack is a diverse smorgasbord of different sounds and genres, from the energetic techno-rap opening theme, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns6wGXBFkYc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Katamari Time</u></a>, to the funk-jazz-fusion jam, Power of Katamari Damacy, to the unexpectedly lovely choral title track from one of the series’ original composers, Asuka Sakai, featuring the San Francisco Boys Choir. There’s not a bad track among the 36-song bunch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Once Upon A Katamari is happy to oblige your sonic nostalgia for the other games, too, with nearly every track from the series’ 21-year history available in a music selector that has a handful of options to tweak. You can make a playlist of your favorite songs from across the series or loop a specific favorite over any of Once Upon A Katamari’s levels. It’s frustrating that you can’t just play an individual game’s soundtrack in order, and that multiple games are inexplicably clumped together in two separate eras instead of game by game, but the playlist feature at least more or less makes up for those shortcomings. The shuffle feature also has an odd hiccup where whichever song played last starts over when you start the next level. And since some of these levels are shorter than much of the near-100-song tracklist, you might wind up hearing some songs more times in a row than you’d want when choosing shuffle, but you can always select a new song before starting a level to fix that.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Charlie Wacholz’s Favorite Video Game Soundtracks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rengame’s surgical approach to recreating the immutable charm of this series deftly avoids the uninteresting pitfalls of hollow nostalgia. Instead of treating iconic levels from the original as gospel doomed to be worn out in every Katamari game like the requisite recreation of 1-1 in the Mario series, nearly every stage here is wholly original. Katamari’s newest custodians toy with the formula with careful precision, supplementing the flow of what I’ve come to expect from a roll-icking good time with new level types and even power-ups to augment your rolling while taking care not to disrupt the delicate balance of calm and chaos that defines Katamari. Combining that with subtle modernizations established in more recent Katamari games, like a clearer scoring system, Once Upon A Katamari threads the needle between old and new surprisingly well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, using both joysticks to control where and how you roll has always been deliberately awkward, with the mass becoming harder and harder to maneuver as you grow exponentially. Once Upon A Katamari makes zooming around at smaller sizes feel a little more precise than it used to, which I didn’t like at first, but this ultimately helped highlight the sense of scale this series has always been good at in bright yellow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The power-ups add a nice layer to the rolling as well, and let Rengame play with new design ideas that emphasize the puzzle element of efficiently finding your way around – even breaking the trance-like flow for a certain level or part of one to instead experiment with puzzle-like problems to solve. The Rocket power-up, for example, helped me brave a powerful wind storm to pick up a few extra items, but only lasted for a short burst of speed, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy I wasn’t normally used to. The Radar power-up helped me find specific items to complete a pharaoh’s series of requests in one of the Ancient Egypt levels as he asked for 10 bananas or a dozen eggs. None of these drastically reshape or redefine the rolling at Katamari’s core, but do open up new level design ideas that offer fun diversions from the standard “make your <em>katamari </em>as big as possible” levels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Katamari’s newest custodians toy with the formula with careful precision.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Upon A Katamari is by far the biggest game in the series to date, though still relatively small in scope overall - it took me around 10 hours to complete every main level at least once. Rengame acknowledges and helps buttress this with new collectibles to find in each level and unlockable challenges to keep me coming back with a new approach. In addition to finding cousins who serve as additional playable characters and gifts that unlock new customization options for them, three crowns are hidden in each level, adding extra challenges and legitimately compelling reasons to revisit levels. Having a certain number of cousins or crowns will open up extra levels, too, adding even more reason to roll around the same place a few times. Challenges don’t offer the same rewards, but they’re a nice nod to players like me who regularly revisit completed Katamari games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all said, the stages that are available are unfortunately lopsided, with a majority of the levels taking place in Edo Japan – it holds more than double the amount of levels as the next biggest era. I understand that this series has always embraced Japanese culture, but in the context of Once Upon A Katamari’s time travel concept, it feels like a lot of ground was left uncovered across the nine other eras, some of which only host as few as three or four levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rengame also builds on the multiplayer modes established in the other Katamari games with the series’ best take on multiplayer to date. While co-op control of a single katamari isn't available this time around, the PvP mode once again has you and other rollers try to pick up the most stuff. But unlike previous entries, you earn points by depositing your hard-earned stuff in a UFO, giving more utility to the new power-ups and adding a more dynamic flow to competition than just rolling as much as possible. Once your time’s up, The King intervenes to hand out bonus points in a Mario Party-style round-up that awards competitors for stuff like the number of times they’ve used a power-up or rolled up their opponents. It’s nothing revolutionary, but a step up that makes multiplayer feel like more than just an afterthought.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/once-upon-a-katamari-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and Retro Studios brought Metroid into stunning 3D with 2002's Metroid Prime, rebooting the series in a first-person shooter style through a sometimes challenging but ultimately fruitful relationship between Japanese and Western teams -- each with their own unique backgrounds and perspectives. But it wasn’t always smooth rolling for Samus along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s according to a new book: Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective, in which Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe comments throughout, sharing memories and insights from his perspective working with the U.S.-based Retro Studios on a Metroid game. This was a significant cross-seas, collaborative effort for Nintendo. Retro was working on a completely separate first-person game before series producer (and Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda creator) Shigeru Miyamoto proclaimed it should be a Metroid game. Metroid Prime was thus born. Tanabe recalls: “Metroid Prime was not a project that was originally planned. It was a title that came about by chance, as a result of Mr. Miyamoto clarifying the direction Retro should take… In a way it could be called a miracle.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The game we are making now is a Nintendo game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tanabe frames the relationship between Retro Studios and Nintendo as ultimately hierarchical, with Nintendo having final say. “...Nintendo retained the final decision-making authority, there were many instances early on where our approaches to the specifications did not align, leading to disagreements. Retro often explained, ‘This is how Western studios approach and think about game development.' To help them understand our perspective, I told them, ‘Yes, but the game we are making now is a Nintendo game, and this is Retro’s first time working on one. I’ve been working on Nintendo games my whole career, so I believe I have the most experience in making Nintendo games. So please trust me first.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This led to creative tensions, with Retro holding its ground, clearly unwilling to totally cave to Nintendo. “One day, during a video conference about the Meta Ridley battle, our discussions kept clashing, and we couldn’t find common ground," Tanabe continued. "Time slipped away and by the time the meeting (which had started in the morning) finally ended, the sun was setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tanabe describes a Retro Studios that needed to be introduced to a set of design philosophies unique to Nintendo, for example enemy design beyond bosses was something Miyamoto had strong feelings about. “Many Nintendo developers have learned from Mr. Miyamoto that the appearance of enemy characters should be designed based on functionality… this had not yet been articulated quite so concisely. As a result, it took time for us to convey the concept clearly to Retro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the collaboration working well in some cases, for instance, Retro won out in the implementation of morph ball rolling. In Metroid Prime, you generally view the game through Samus’s visor in first-person fashion, but for puzzles and tight spaces, Samus can transform into a rolling Morph Ball at which point the camera zooms out to third-person. Tanabe says of this: “The transition animation for shifting from first-person Morph Ball mode was proposed by Retro …however Retro also suggested a skip feature to reduce morphing time, but Mr. Miyamoto directed that it should be unskippable, as it was one of the opportunities to view Samus in third-person.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that Retro really pushed hard for the rolling mechanic to be expanded and ultimately won out, in an example of Nintendo relenting in the face of a great idea. Tanabe says: “Retro also proposed the mechanic of rolling through half-pipes in Morph Ball mode. Initially, Nintendo was skeptical, questioning whether it would actually be fun. However, Retro responded, ‘Please try it first before deciding.’”</p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The exchange of ideas and a willingness for teams to learn from one another paid off ultimately in a game IGN called a "must-have masterpiece” and which, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review"><u>for the 2023 remake, I scored a perfect 10/10</u></a>. Tanabe reflects: “[The Metroid Prime Trilogy] was made possible by Retro maximizing the hardware’s potential through expert engineering, incorporating countless ideas without compromise to refine game design, and setting new standards for graphics in Nintendo titles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is out October 28, 2025 and shares hundreds of pieces of concept art from the trilogy across Gamecube, Wii, and the Prime remake on Nintendo Switch. Comments from Retro Studios accompany Tanabe’s frequent notes, along with text taken from the game’s ample expository logs and scans. Metroid Prime 4, the latest team-up between Retro Studios and Nintendo, is set for Nintendo Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Samuel Claiborn is IGN's managing editor and a fixes/breaks ancient arcade and pinball machines in his garage.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 Review - Starship Bloopers</p>

<p>"We want to share an update on our most recent patch. It was originally planned for Tuesday, but a last-minute certification issue caused a delay," the developer said. "The team is now targeting delivery by the end of this week, with staff ready to work over the weekend if needed. There's still a small chance the issue won't be fully resolved by Friday, which could push the patch to next week. We're doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding."</p><p>It's unclear if the delayed patch is the same one Arrowhead Game Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-planned-for-october-with-bigger-performance-pieces-needing-more-time/1100-6534979/" data-ref-id="1100-6534979">planned to arrive in "mid-October-ish"</a> that'll fix the game's performance bugs. However, based on what we know about that update and what the studio has said about this delayed patch, it's safe to assume that they're connected, if not one in the same. After all, the delayed patch, according to Arrowhead Game Studios, will "focus on fixing performance, bugs, and balance," which is what the planned "mid-October-ish" update will do--and more.</p><p>"As we previously shared, we have pushed back our content releases, including Warbonds, to focus on fixing performance, bugs, and balance," the studio said. "The upcoming patch includes many bug fixes, performance optimizations, and a weapons/enemy balance pass--not included in the list below. We want to share a smaller list of optimizations with you ahead of time so that you can get a better idea of what's coming, and then the full patch notes will go live with the patch as usual."</p><p>This update isn't out yet, so we don't have the full patch notes right now. That said, Arrowhead Game Studios did provide a brief overview of the optimizations you can expect to see when the delayed patch finally drops.</p><h3><b>Optimizations For The Upcoming Release:</b></h3><ul><li>Optimized status effects</li><li>Optimized physics by only enabling powered ragdolls when needed</li><li>Optimized physics body handling for damage calculations</li><li>Optimized Automaton units and NPC eyes, by changing them from particle effects to shaders</li><li>Optimized AI behaviors by analyzing and stripping out redundant code</li><li>Reduced stuttering during drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds</li><li>Improved audio IO performance</li><li>Snow distribution and overall look has been reworked</li><li>Improved performance by tweaking LOD settings for characters</li><li>Optimized asset distribution for several planets types</li><li>Optimized scattered assets such as grass on various planet types</li><li>Optimized asset distribution in Hiveworlds and Terminid caves</li><li>Optimized asset setup and geometry for assets used in Hiveworlds and Terminid caves</li><li>Optimized status effect physics and particle systems while maintaining visual feedback and fidelity</li><li>Optimized various Automaton explosion VFX</li><li>Optimized Acid Rain effects during Acid Storms</li><li>Optimized Dragonroach fire attack VFX</li><li>Made various optimizations to the fire system, including particle and light optimization.</li><li>Improved performance by optimizing the rendering of several shaders</li></ul>

<figure data-uuid="87826e282ef1e"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/87826e282ef1e/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's less than 24 hours to go before we get another 60-minute dose of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> info from Masahiro Sakurai himself, but someone's a little keen to get off the start line, it seems, as the legendary game designer has already lifted the lid on some new footage.</p>
<p>As shared on the official <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" tabindex="-1">@KirbyAirRiders</a> X account, Sakurai has provided a course overview for the steampunk-inspired 'Steamgust Forge' track, and he does so by, you guessed it, demolishing the hardest CPU opponents in a race.</p>
<p>Similar to the Waveflow Waters demonstration from the <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">first</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Air Riders Direct</a>, this whistle-stop tour of the steampunk environment showcases the tight turns and chaotic combat you'll have to contend with. It's also another chance to wrap your head around just how <em>fast</em> everything is — Mario Kart this ain't.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>This isn't the first overview that Sakurai has provided since the last Direct — earlier this month, he raced around the autumnal '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzMXDirLNZw">Mount Amberfalls</a>' circuit — but it's funny to see him still revealing new information despite there being a 60-minute presentation right around the corner. Oh Sakurai, never change!</p>
<p>The Direct itself kicks off tomorrow at 2pm BST / 3pm CET / 6am PT / 9am ET. As for what will be shown, your guess is as good as ours! Bring on more course overviews, we suppose...</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-tops-the-us-sales-charts-for-september-2025-and-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima%E2%80%99s-covid-era-numbers.1331734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Circana analyst and senior director Mat Piscatella has reported the latest sales charts for video game sales in the United States for the month of September 2025, and it's a sports-games-focused top five with a mix of shooting and some sword slashing, as Borderlands 4 lands in the number one spot, Ghost of Yotei cracks the top five at the number four spot, and the latest annualized sports titles making up the rest of the top five.</p>



<p>As Piscatella does each month, he shared the charts for the best-selling premium games of the previous month and how they factor into the best-selling premium games of 2025 so far in the US. With Borderlands 3 shooting to the top of the sales charts for the month of September 2025, it also did well enough to become the third-best-selling premium game in the US in 2025 so far with Monster Hunter Wilds in second and NBA 2K26 in first ahead of it.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26, for its part, was one of the annualized sports games that filled out the rest of the top five best-selling premium games for September. It landed just behind Borderlands 4 in the number two spot, while EA Sports FC 26 came in at number three, followed by Ghost of Yotei, with Madden NFL 26 rounding out the top five in fifth.</p>







<p>Even though Ghost of Yotei didn't make the top three for best-selling premium games, it's worth noting that it made the top five even without being in players' hands, since it officially launched on October 2. Piscatella also points out that Yotei's numbers were "<em>flat</em>" in comparison to Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>That might not sound like a positive takeaway, but when you remember that at the time of Tsushima's launch on July 17, 2020, much of the world was under COVID-19 lockdowns, with the video game industry enjoying a massive boom with everyone spending all their time inside, many not fully back to work as companies across the globe adjusted to the pandemic, it's clearly a sign of how strong Yotei's performance was.</p>







<p>Ghost of Yotei also cracked the charts for the best-selling premium games in the US for 2025 so far at number 18. Overall, for a console-exclusive title, there's no denying that Ghost of Yotei is off to a strong sales start.</p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 was once again the best-selling console of the month in the US, followed by the PlayStation 5. The PS5 also hit a milestone in September, as it officially surpassed the lifetime install base of the PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Overall, September was a strong sales month for the video game industry in the US, as Piscatella reports the total spend across hardware, software, and accessories grew 10% compared to last year. It'll be interesting to see how October's charts line up, with Yotei having a full month on shelves and the arrival of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>For more on Ghost of Yotei, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">check out our full review</a> where Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo gave it an 8.8/10, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-za-review-a-mega-adventure.1331731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8e948d2c-e718-4b87-9a04-0d0bc246614c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Pokémon </a></em>formula has been slow-moving over the years, with <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ab965b69-179c-4525-9aa0-c19799509f61" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a></em>, a big change was made in exploration and story format. The release of <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> makes some steps even further from the formula, but also many closer. Do these differences make it a better <em>Pokémon </em>game, or something harder to recognize?</p>

<p><em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> is set in the town of Lumiose City, which was a central setpiece for the events of <em>Pokémon X and Y</em> for the Nintendo 3DS, and now is the sole location for your <em>Legends ZA</em> adventure. You play as a newcomer, visiting Lumiose City for a holiday before you get wrapped up in taking part in a city-wide night-time battle tournament called the Z-A Royale, investigating mysterious Rogue Mega Evolution events, and exploring the city.</p>

<h2>Revisit Kalos And Become A Pokémon Master</h2>

<p>The start of the story is strong, introducing you to the primary cast of characters while also teaching you about the Pokémon-inhabited Wild Zones of the city. You'll meet characters like your rival Taunie/Urbain, fellow members of Team MZ, Naveen and Lida, and AZ, the mysterious hotel keeper, as well as some major players in the city, like Emma the detective.</p>

<p>There isn't any level of collecting badges; instead, your simple goal is to join a battle royal event called the Z-A Royal and work your way from Rank Z to Rank A (as the name implies). As you progress through the game, you're also introduced to the mystery of mega energy seeping out all over Lumiose City, which has been leading certain Pokémon to go rogue, leaving people in danger. This drive to become stronger, as well as the mystery of the rogue Mega Evolution, is the core thread that will pull you through the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-exploration_0.jpg?itok=DbckCvYg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-exploration_0.jpg?itok=XqEYkzhA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While the story is very much present, it also gives plenty of breathing room. Your next objective might be to reach a new rank or to take out a rampaging Rogue Mega Pokémon. You can reach these objectives quite easily, but it's in the amount of exploration that can be done and side-quests to accomplish that you'll find yourself stopping to smell the roses and take in everything that the game has to offer.</p>

<p>Something I really enjoyed about the story of <em>Legends ZA</em> compared to other, more traditional, titles in the <em>Pokemon </em>franchise is that it wasn't that you got to spend 50-60% of the game completing your main objective of badges/Z-A Royale, then get an interlude story where the evil team tries to take over the world, and then back to completing your goal of being the very best, like no one ever was. Instead, the story is constantly being woven in and out of the Z-A Royale storyline, culminating in what might be one of <em>Pokémon</em>'s most impressive finale setpieces.</p>

<p>The story did a great job highlighting not just the protagonist's ability to be the greatest Pokémon trainer, but also managed to create a group that actually felt like they were friends with each other and not just the main character, and fill the city with a unique and colorful supporting cast of characters.</p>

<h2>A New Way To Battle</h2>

<p>One of the largest changes to the Pokémon formula is in the new active battles. Instead of a static turn-based experience, the combat in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> lets you roam around with your Pokémon to your side, calling out attacks for it to you as it maneuvers into place, trying to hit your opponent while not getting hit yourself.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-combat.jpg?itok=Ha0RsYOs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-combat.jpg?itok=2PpkrCj_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I am a huge fan of this gameplay style, possibly because it's the closest I'll ever expect we get to an anime-style Pokémon battle, but also because at its core it's not too different from classic Pokémon battling, and there's plenty of room to grow.</p>

<p>If you want, you can send out your Pokémon, and you and your opponent can stand statically, hitting each other until one of you faints. There are a number of things you can factor into your strategy that will allow you to deal more damage faster, or even avoid damage in certain scenarios.</p>

<p>Speed and range of attacks are far more important in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, as with the right loadout, you can get 2-3 attacks in while your opponent is still queuing up their second attack. Each move will have the Pokémon move to a specific spot or within close range. This means there's a new level of strategy to how you want to respond to your opponents' attacks, too.</p>

<p>When an enemy uses Fly, you can begin to move, and with enough skill, might avoid your opponent crashing down. Similarly, for massive attacks like Hyper Beam, you could find a way to avoid it by strafing or even putting the environment between yourself and the attacks. I loved learning the different ways I could fight with my Pokémon, how to best chain attacks into each other, and what type advantages I could come up with on the fly.</p>

<p>In Ranked Play, this causes the 4-player free-for-all battles to be truly chaotic. Moving from lobby to lobby, your team of three might be perfectly set up to sweep the enemy, or you could truly be out of luck as you get countered by something super-effective to you at every turn. There's nothing more satisfying than sniping an enemy's kill with a long-range flamethrower, and alternatively, there's nothing worse than being so close to the kill and having it stolen away.</p>

<p>I don't expect this combat to replace the classic formula, or even have anywhere near as much popularity, but as someone who never got into the competitive side of Pokémon, I was excited to Hyper Train some Pokémon to compete in Ranked Play.</p>

<p>The best use of the active combat is in the Raid-like Rogue Mega Evolution battles, where you need to fight an enraged Mega Pokémon. For these battles, you're paired with one of your story companions and end up on a battlefield to take on this gargantuan Pokémon.</p>

<p>The basic formula of the battle is to deal super-effective damage to the Mega Pokémon, siphon off some Mega Energy in the shape of dropped orbs, and then Mega Evolve your own Pokémon to deal as much damage as possible until they revert. While you're doing this, you'll also need to be dodging the Pokémon's attacks.</p>

<p>This Rogue Mega Pokémon doesn't just attack your Pokémon, but also focuses on the player. You'll be running, dodge rolling, and even recalling your Pokémon to keep them out of harm's way during battles.</p>

<p>Some of these Pokémon set off incredible effects like tornadoes that follow you around the stage, violent rocky shockwaves, and a classic massive beam of energy that follows you as you run from it.</p>

<p>The biggest downside of these Rogue Mega Encounters for me was that while they're repeatable, there was no way to enjoy them with a friend. As the Pokémon franchise has promoted Max Raids and Tera Raids, I was disappointed to learn that there wasn't any way to pair up with even a single friend and take on these gargantuan foes together, especially when there's already local battle multiplayer.</p>

<h2>The City Is Alive</h2>

<p>It's clear that <em>Pokémon </em>has taken inspiration from other recent Nintendo successes like <em>Breath of the Wild,&nbsp;</em>where, after completing the tutorial, the whole map is open to you. You've got a variety of Pokémon-filled areas to explore, as well as a multitude of side quests to immediately involve yourself even further with the city.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-veritcality.jpg?itok=qwS9uaAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-veritcality.jpg?itok=XJcouFqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Even on the ground level, at nearly any point, you can rotate in a complete circle and see one or possibly two Wild Zones, a shop or cafe, wild Pokémon, or an NPC with a side-quest ready to ask of you. This also felt like a lesson learned from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>: the world doesn't have to be the largest, but if you pack it densely, then players won't be able to stop getting sidetracked as they move from main objective to main objective. 99 times out of 100, I'll prefer a smaller but more densely packed world that one that can promise landscapes that you can walk in a straight line for hours in, but there's nothing to see or do.</p>

<p>The way that <em>Pokémon </em>has further enhanced Lumiose City is through the amount of verticality it has. You can walk along all of the main and side streets, discovering little parks or water features along the way, but you can also take to the roofs filled with Pokémon and hidden items. Unlocking elevators to different roofs and traversal options are other perks of progressing through the storyline, letting what seems like a static world at first grow in size while not physically getting larger.</p>

<p>Going into <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, and honestly, even for the first hour or two while the game has you on rails, I was concerned that the map would be too small, and now that I'm 50-60 hours in, I couldn't have been more incorrect, as I keep turning corners and finding new interesting places.</p>

<h2>Side-Quest Variety Impressed</h2>

<p>What fuels a lot of your exploration is the Side-Quests, with around 100 in total for the whole game. Some of these are quite basic, can you battle with me or show me a certain type of Pokémon, while others are side-quests masquerading as tutorials teaching new players about the benefits or drawbacks of poison vs paralysis, or how moves like Protect are helpful.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-side-quest.jpg?itok=4tWsPg50 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-side-quest.jpg?itok=yNlAgmfJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A number of side-quests that long for a lot of games can be a red flag to certain people; the strength of the side-quests in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA </em>comes down to two simple things.</p>

<p>The first is that there was a health variety in the types of things being asked of you. A fair number were battles, which for a <em>Pokémon </em>game didn't even entirely feel like a side-quest, while others would have you collect certain Pokémon, trade Pokémon, search for hidden Pokémon in a museum (one of my favorites), and even chase down fleeing Pokémon.</p>

<p><em>Legends ZA</em> also used side-quests as a way to gift the player with Pokémon such as Froakie, Fennekin, and Chespin in interesting and unusual ways.</p>

<p>The second major strength is that none of these side-missions were very long. Depending on how much time you have to sit down and play, you might be able to complete a night of Z-A Royale, or you might just want to finish 'one more' quest. These quick quests mean there's always just one more little thing for you to do, and then when you realize you still have a bit more time then you can squeeze in another.</p>

<h2><em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends ZA</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Going into <em>Pokémon Legends ZA </em>I had a lot of fears. How will it run? Is Lumoise City going to feel too small? Will it be able to compare with the epic story of <em>Pokémon Legends Arceus</em>? Will the new combat style be fun?</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was impressed with pretty much every aspect of the game. <em>Pokémon Legends AZ</em> is an incredibly polished game from start to finish with an entertaining story that's fun for newcomers and veterans alike. Lumiose City might not physically expand, but with the introduction of new areas and Wild Zones throughout the story progression, you get to experience it growing as you do.</p>

<p>Best of all, the core mechanic of <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, the new active combat, is incredibly fun. It was such a fun experience taking Pokémon and attacks I knew and seeing them played out in motion instead of stuck in place. It made the combat more engaging and opened up new levels of strategy for a lot of moves that might not otherwise get much love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It only took a few notes from the <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> menu music to transport me to a long-forgotten world of sunflowers, pea shooters, and not being able to put the dang game down for one second. First released in 2009, the colorful strategy game was an instant hit, adding to developer PopCap’s enviable lineup of time-wasters like <em>Peggle</em> and <em>Bejeweled</em>. And now it’s been newly remastered so you can relive those days on modern consoles. The updated <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, dubbed <em>Replanted</em>, is still a great game that stands the test of time — and it’s also a depressing reminder of just how badly EA fumbled this franchise.</p><p>If you haven’t had the pleasure of fighting off the undead using only a garden full of plants, the premise is relatively simple. The zombies are here, and you need to defend your little slice of home. On the right side of the screen is your house, which you need to protect, and on the left, the undead will shamble in to attack. Between the two is a lawn divided into rows. You fend off these hordes using a green thumb, planting flowers in that lawn that each have a unique ability. The pea shooters… shoot peas, making them the basic turrets of your arsenal. There are stomping squashes and walnuts that form protective barriers, along with explosive cherry bombs. At the core of all of this is the humble sunflower; in order to add new plants, you need to harness the sun, which is generated from those smiling flowers.</p><p><em>PvZ</em> is a serious and deep strategy game masquerading as a Sunday morning cartoon. The complexity steadily ramps up, introducing things like pools and nighttime free of sun that force you to adapt new strategies while continuing to give you more fauna that can be utilized as instruments of destruction. The sheer variety means that there’s a lot of potential for creativity and experimentation. Nearly two decades later, I still get a lot of enjoyment out of placing a man-eating plant behind a walnut, where it can munch on unsuspecting zombies. The whole experience is then slathered with charm, from bouncing, cheerful plant life to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ">perhaps the catchiest song in video game history</a>. It was a near-perfect game, and the remaster offers some enhanced visuals, a few new ways to play co-op, and a handful of single-player modes. But not much changed, because it didn’t need to.</p><p>Sounds like the perfect recipe for a beloved series, right? EA seemed to have that exact same thought when it acquired PopCap in 2011. But instead of a proper sequel, the publisher expanded the <em>PvZ</em> brand in other ways. There were Facebook spinoffs and a strange shooter series called <em>Garden Warfare</em>, along with plentiful comic books and other merchandise. <em>Plants vs. Zombies 2</em> did launch in 2013, with a free-to-play mobile iteration that had some interesting ideas but eventually became bogged down by energy timers, microtransactions, and constant updates. It largely played like <em>PvZ</em>, but it lacked the purity of vision that made the original so great. That didn’t matter much to EA, of course, because <em>PvZ 2</em> did numbers, <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/plants-vs-zombies-2-sprouts-big-numbers">reaching a much larger</a> — and more lucrative — audience than its predecessor.</p><p>But something was lost in the search for more players (and money). While the series became financially successful, the creativity that made it so beloved steadily dwindled. The original <em>PvZ</em> was a hand-crafted, carefully tuned experience with a beginning, middle, and end. It’s the kind of game that you want to revisit through a remaster like this because it’s just that good. The sequels and spinoffs, meanwhile, were mostly watered-down versions of this premise that proved much more disposable. It’s not like I’m anticipating playing a remaster of <em>PvZ2</em> in a few years. (A third mainline game is currently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042133/ea-plants-vs-zombies-3-soft-launch">soft-launch limbo</a>.)</p><p>It’s a sad state of affairs for a concept that once held such promise. And the fact that I really can’t stop playing the remaster — I’ve whispered<em> just one more round</em> to myself multiple times while writing this — drives that point home further. And things don’t look like they’ll be getting better anytime soon. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">EA is in the midst of going private in a deal worth $55 billion</a>, which will almost certainly necessitate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">further layoffs and fewer risks</a>. That means focusing even more on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">big games with big earning potential</a>, instead of cute games that worm their way into your heart. In that way, this remaster is like a time capsule from a simpler, happier time.</p><p><sub>Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted <em>launches on October 23rd on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/803795/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-remaster-switch-pc-ps5-xbox]]></content:encoded>
