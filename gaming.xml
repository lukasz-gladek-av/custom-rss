The Crimson Wings must answer a call for help, and a new playable character, The White Wolf, will join them. The expansion features new equipment and items, new minigames, plus over 40 new monsters you’ll battle to the tune of 15 new music tracks by composer Eddie Marianukroh.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3ky84QJcxw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3ky84QJcxw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s exciting to see Chain of Echoes get a big expansion like this, years after its initial launch. We scored the game an 8.75 out of 10, with <em>Game Informer</em> editor-in-chief Matt Miller writing in his review, “Whether you currently count yourself a JRPG connoisseur or fondly recall the ʼ90s heyday of the genre, Chained Echoes is well worth your time.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ashes of Elrant will be available for each version of Chained Echoes on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The price of the DLC has not been disclosed.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/26/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-lands-in-august]]></content:encoded>

<p>Onto hardware now, and it has been another big one for the Switch 2, with an additional 140,026 units under its belt after surpassing the big one milly last week. Interestingly, the Switch Lite and OLED models follow behind in second and third, meaning that the Switch 1's combined sales (12,769) are once again higher than the PS5's (6,006) across the consoles' respective SKUs, after Sony took the lead last time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dune: Awakening developer Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/">released the latest update</a> for the new large-scale survival game, which adds the changes that creative director<a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/"> Joel Bylos recently announced</a>, including changes to ornithopters, the removal of restrictions for visiting sietches, and most significantly, making areas of the Deep Desert PvE zones, to help improve the endgame experience for solo players and those who don't want to engage in the intense PvP gameplay the Deep Desert has become known for.</p>
<p>The entire southern half of the Deep Desert map is now a PvE zone, allowing players who don't want to engage in PvP to harvest and look for high-value resources without having to venture further into the Deep Desert.</p>
<p>That said, there is a greater density of high-value resources if you do venture further north into the Deep Desert and PvP areas. The high risk of engaging in PvP will always grant the highest reward for those willing to take on the risk.</p>
<p>Plasteel plates, for example, can still only be found in PvP zones. The number of active medium spice fields has also been reduced from 8 to 6, while the number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22, and the largest spice fields will still only be found in the north of the Deep Desert.</p>
<p>The Titanium and Stravidium spawn rate has also been reduced in PvE zones, which means that the only way to find large quantities of either will once again be to travel to the PvP regions of the Deep Desert. The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has also been increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Regarding vehicles, the major changes are for the Scout Ornithopters, which now have their speed and maneuverability decreased, should you decide to equip yours with rocket launchers. It's a 20% speed decrease for Scout Ornithopters and a 10% decrease for Assault Ornithopters.</p>
<p>The last few notable aspects of this patch are the restrictions on visiting other sietches being lifted, with any player now able to go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want, and a slew of bug fixes and stability improvements. Beyond that, the last notable aspect of this patch is what it lacks - the changes to the Landsraad that Bylos mentioned in his previous statement.</p>
<p>All of these changes to Dune: Awakening have been met with a mixed reception from players. Some, notably those who have been engaging with PvP, think Funcom already had the right balance. Others, namely those who don't want to engage in PvP, think these changes are for the better. Either way, Funcom has been clear that the team will continue to adapt and balance the game per player feedback. It'll be interesting to see how it evolves over the course of the year, especially when Funcom reveals the<a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/"> first major content drop in a few months time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds</em>, the first major DLC expansion for museum management sim&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, and it's heading your way next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-museum/blogs/89-two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-coming-17th-july" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>site,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th across all platforms on which the game is currently available, and it'll bring a ton of extra stuff for you to enjoy, all of it fantasy-themed.</p>

<p>First off, you can look forward to 40 new exhibits "with magical properties to hypnotize guests with", and that's not necessarily a figure of speech, either. You'd better watch your guests around some of the more esoteric oddments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=47nUXFxD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=rYpSmJPY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC has weird stuff galore for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new exhibits,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a new Expert type, a new map to explore, and plenty of "exclusive decorations, items, and utility items" for you to fill your museum up with.</p>

<p>More interactive displays will also be introduced in the DLC, as well as a new helicopter paint job and three new guest archetypes for you to keep happy. You'd better make sure they don't get hypnotized!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, it's a management sim, and you'll never guess what you get to manage. That's right: your very own aquarium. The clue's in the name, I guess.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, Two Point Studios' latest lets you manage a museum, oversee its exhibits, and try to keep its guests happy, all while acquiring your own artifacts and trying to thwart the efforts of enterprising thieves.</p>




<p>The game is the latest management sim from Two Point Studios, who, as the name suggests, can also count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">2018's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">Two Point Hospital</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">2022's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">Two Point Campus</a>&nbsp;</em>as feathers in their cap.</p>

<p><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592600/Two_Point_Museum_Fantasy_Finds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on July 17th, and the base game is currently available on all of those platforms as well.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, the troubled sequel to dino husbandry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, will "hopefully" launch into early access by 2027, according to Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz. The key question appears to be when to shift the focus away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the original Ark's Unreal Engine 5 revamp, which launched in early access in 2023. Also, designing a Soulslike combat system is hard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">PCGamesN</a>, Stieglitz explained that Studio Wildcard had a vertical slice (loosely defined, a demo that shows off all aspects of the final game) for Ark 2 prior to Survival Ascended's launch. But the devs "felt that as a team, it would be very difficult to follow that all the way through to a complete game with both our experience level and [our scope] as a company". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz says the developers needed to get their heads around Unreal Engine 5 before taking a swing at Ark 2, and in particular, its new Soulslicorice combat system. "It's very difficult to do soulslike combat in a multiplayer PvP context," Stieglitz went on. "You could probably count the number of games on one hand that have even attempted that in an actual PvP context."
</p>
<p>(FromSofties may be in uproar over this last claim - in his defence, Stieglitz is presumably referring to games like Ark that allow dozens of players per public session. Still, by all means count up the alternatives and prove him wrong. I'd do it but I need both these hands to type with.)</p>
<p>
Right now, "a small portion" of Studio Wildcard are working to "refine" the mechanics of that old Ark 2 vertical slice. Stieglitz reckons it'll take "18 months of hardcore team focus to [turn] that vertical slice into an early access game, when we get to put the vast majority of our team back on it." He thinks Ark 2 will launch into early access "hopefully within the next two years", but it all depends on when Studio Wildcard decide to shift their efforts away from Survival Ascended.
</p>
<p>
Aside from dancing the Soulslike Fantastic with the new brontosaurus-punching mechanics, Studio Wildcard intend to feature proper NPC antagonists in Ark 2, "because that's been implied by the trailer and has been part of our design for quite some time as an opposing force, so to speak". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz wants to "add a lot more threat level to the environment and the feeling of being able to enjoy a PvP-like experience, even without [fighting against other players]." He's also gunning for a user-generated content system that works more "seamlessly under the hood while you're playing the game", rather than being presented as a menu.
</p>
<p>
Survival Evolved players may not be too tickled to hear of the present commitment to Survival Ascended. The Unreal Engine revamp launched in October 2023 with some new creatures and structures, but without much of Survival Evolved's expansion content. In the process, Giant Squid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-evolveds-official-servers-switch-off-in-just-a-few-hours-paving-the-way-for-remake">took the original game's servers offline</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As the developers have hitherto made plain, Ascended exists in large part to fund Ark 2's development, not just help them cut their teeth on a new engine or git gud at parrying. Initially, they were planning to launch it in a bundle with a $50 Ark 2 pre-order, but players swarmed the comms like testy oviraptors, and the developers ultimately released Ascended by itself for $45, before launch discounts. It now has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">a DLC roadmap that runs till end of 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bad blood continues to swirl. Steam user reviews for Ascended remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/#app_reviews_hash">mixed</a>, and the original Ark <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">has more players on Steam right now</a>, despite the loss of official server support. Still, I'm sure Studio Wildcard will keep plugging on with it, because after all, confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as...

                <p dir="ltr">Vlambeer has provided a major update to Nuclear Throne for the first time since November 2017, adding support for 60/120fps modes, a new controls menu, and various aspect ratios. So far, these features are part of the beta build for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike</a> shooter. The company plans to bring them to everyone in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Nuclear Throne beta build was announced <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/nuclearthrone/announcements/detail/528724684296945992">on Steam</a>, with directions on how to get into the game's beta. However, all players of the top-down shooter should see the updates eventually, with Vlambeer promising to "bring these improvements and more to the main game." Intriguingly, <a href="https://x.com/Vlambeer/status/1937966326447833330" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>, the company noted that there are physical versions of Nuclear Throne available for Switch as part of the post thread. This could maybe hint at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 update</a> for the game that allows for 120fps on the hybrid system.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Nuclear Throne can be found on PC, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-nintendo-switch-games-are-out-now-after-dire/1100-6465717/">Switch (it arrived in 2019)</a>. The game started in Steam Early Access in 2013 before fully launching in late 2015. The new beta build improvements may also tease possible versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though Vlambeer hasn't stated anything official.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the reasons for the long break in updates for Nuclear Throne is probably partially because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/acclaimed-dev-vlambeer-is-surprise-shutting-down-o/1100-6481685/">the studio effectively closed down in 2020 after 10 years</a>. However, almost a year ago, Vlambeer returned after co-founder Jan Willem Nijman bought the name outright, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24121948/nuclear-throne-vlambeer-studio-ownership" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>. With the company's second act, Nijman noted he aimed to "preserve the classic Vlambeer games, and make sure they stay playable far into the future." Vlambeer is also known for Ridiculous Fishing, with Ultrabugs in the works.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is more likely to be held back by software limitations, some of them shared with its predecessor, than hardware limitations.</p>
<p>Speaking in the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassells commented on some of the Nintendo Switch 2 software limitations that could impact game performance. Among them are the FAT32 and exFAT file systems, which both the original Switch and the new generation system use. These dated file systems have all sorts of drawbacks over other file systems, such as the 4GB file size limit of FAT32, which leads to issues such as forcing developers to use smaller files, which can limit texture quality, or dividing files into chunks. Regarding this, the Alderon Games founder finds it baffling that Nintendo continues to use these dated file systems, as they also pay a licensing fee to Microsoft to use them with no concrete benefit. PlayStation consoles, for example, use their file systems based on Linux free file systems, and so have none of the limitations of FAT32 and exFAT.</p>
<p>This isn't the only software limitation the Nintendo Switch 2 has that the other consoles don't. While developers can work around the file size limit, Nintendo puts another limitation on top of it. Unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo keeps a strict limit on how many times a game can write data on the NAND to prevent it from dying too soon, which is thoroughly checked in the rigorous approval process for both new games and updates. According to the Alderon Games founder, this is a limitation forced by the company's choice of cheap NAND, which poses the question of whether these limitations are worth the little Nintendo saves on these chips. Additionally, these limitations become even worse if other factors are considered, such as the system reserving a lot of resources for the OS and GameChat, and the massive usage of encryption and DRM, which is not surprising, considering Nintendo's stance on hacking and piracy.</p>
<p>Though this will likely become less of an issue down the line, the Alderon Games founder also lamented the lack of Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which only a few developers own. As such, many developers who want to continue supporting their games on the new system have to do a lot of guesswork and hope the build they are submitting works flawlessly on it.</p>

<p>While some of these limitations could impact games more down the line, they are not exactly a problem right now for users, as the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving to be extremely successful, and has shown what it can do in the hands of expert developers such as CD Projekt Red with the Cyberpunk 2077 port.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-republic-games-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-writer-chris-avellone-teams-up-with-ex-quantic-dream-dev-for-mature-rpg.1229082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chris Avellone, a legendary industry writer who's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, has joined <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>&nbsp;writer Adam Williams' Republic Games for a "mature" fantasy RPG.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chris-avellone-joins-former-quantic-dreams-writer-at-republic-games-to-work-on-ambitious-project-inspired-by-golden-age-of-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Avellone has been added to Williams' team, and while his position in the company is unclear, it's likely that he'll be working as a writer on the project.</p>

<p>Avellone himself says he's the one who asked Williams to join Republic Games; he says that he loves both the "design principles" and the "narrative construction" Williams is building for the project, and that being on the "ground floor" of the game is "amazing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=-8Huog4T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=BsGBYDi9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chris Avellone's industry credits include&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Williams says that Republic Games' first title will be an RPG with a "rich, interesting story", and that it'll feature "lots of meaningful choices, branches, and endings".</p>

<p>The game will revolve around "a totalitarian regime seeking to crush a rebellion", and there will be "competing factions" the player can join. You'll have the "freedom to create the hero - or antihero - [you] want to be", according to Williams.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the game will feature a "deep undercurrent of prophecy and the supernatural", and that it'll also revolve around "full, classic RPG gameplay" that will incorporate "combat, character creation, recruitable companions, romances, and more".</p>

<p>The goal with the as-yet-unnamed game, Williams says, is to "combine that 'golden-age-of-RPGs' design with next-level interactive storytelling". It all sounds pretty ambitious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=2bE6Ph32 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=FKk5jwtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adam Williams has worked as a writer on Quantic Dream's&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Avellone's journey in recent years has been a rocky one. In 2020, multiple women <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-removed-from-games-over-assault-allegations" rel="nofollow">accused him of sexual assault</a>, and although he was later cleared of the allegations, his name hasn't popped up on many major releases since those claims were leveled at him.</p>

<p>For now, Republic Games' ambitious-sounding RPG remains unannounced. Hopefully, we'll get a full reveal in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>2022's excellent indie RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chained_echoes">Chained Echoes</a>' DLC, 'Ashes of Elrant', is coming to Switch on <strong>7th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/indie-rpg-hit-chained-echoes-announces-ashes-of-elrant-dlc">announced earlier this year</a>, publisher Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger today shared a brand new trailer for the story-based DLC today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006">on Steam</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-launches-august-7">Gematsu</a>). Ashes of Elrant was originally planned for Q2 of this year, and August is a <em>little</em> out of that window, but the studio (founded by Matthias Linda) admits that while the DLC was ready, the various translations weren't, so they decided to hold back.</p>
<p>The upcoming DLC sounds absolutely huge and includes a brand new land to explore, over 40 new enemies, a new playable character, more than 15 new music tracks from composer Eddie Marianukroh, new minigames, and new equipment.</p>
<p>Other than the trailer and those little bullet points listed above, here's what else we know about the DLC from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350260/Chained_Echoes_Ashes_of_Elrant/">its Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ashes of Elrant</strong> takes place right before the end of <strong>Chained Echoes</strong>. While you and your clan are preparing for the final fight, a new call for help reaches the Crimson Wings. This mission will reveal more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past. What challenges await you in a new land where nothing is as it seems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this sounds like a must-play if you loved the base game, which we did. We'll be suiting up in our mechs all over again this August, then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mario Kart World</em>’s big open map is one of the major things that sets it apart from the rest of the franchise, but it’s also become a real drag for fans who just want to have traditional three-lap races around their favorite tracks online. A workaround was soon discovered, a sneaky way that let people always  guarantee a three-lap race—until now. Nintendo just nerfed the trick in the Switch 2 exclusive’s latest patch. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Why would Nintendo downgrade their console-seller?” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1lkqke0/why_would_nintendo_downgrade_their_consoleseller/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1lkqke0/why_would_nintendo_downgrade_their_consoleseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked one player</a></span> on the <em>Mario Kart </em>subreddit. That’s the question on everyone’s mind following the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release of Ver. 1.1.2 on June 25</a></span>. The update is very small, with only a few patch notes. The most controversial one reads: “Adjusted courses selected in ‘Random’ when selecting next course in a wireless ‘VS Race.’” That’s apparently Nintendo-speak for “you’re playing the game wrong.” </p><p>See, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is divided into two types of stages. There are the familiar ones like Mario Bros. Circuit and Bowser’s Castle, and then there are the interstitial courses that connect each of these stages in the open world. Each Grand Prix consists of a mix of both, with races on the tracks themselves and also the routes racing between them. They make sense for the game’s new knockout mode, but can otherwise upend the flow of a race. </p><p>Players were getting tired of needing to do that in online vs. mode, too.<em> Mario Kart</em> fans are a competitive bunch and wanted consistency, plus some of the connective tracks are kind of boring. People quickly discovered that if everyone in a lobby selects “random” for the track, <em>Mario Kart World</em> would automatically default to a regular three-lap version of a track. Everyone started doing it. There were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1le7vdy/the_current_state_of_mkw_online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1le7vdy/the_current_state_of_mkw_online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memes about it</a></span>. <em>Mario Kart</em> fans essentially created their own version of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> fans’ “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ssbwiki.com/No_items,_Fox_only,_Final_Destination&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/No_items,_Fox_only,_Final_Destination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Items, Fox Only, Final Destination.</a></span>” </p><p>Apparently Nintendo did not like that, taking roughly a week from when the workaround hit peak meme status in the community to pull the emergency break. “They addressed this in the most Nintendo way possible,” wrote one player on Reddit. “You WILL play as we intend and you will like it!” “Please understand,” another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1lkqqkh/the_entire_community_rn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1lkqqkh/the_entire_community_rn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>, “Like.

If <em>Mario Kart World</em> were on Steam it would be getting review bombed right now. But it’s not and Nintendo rarely bends to community pressure. </p><p>“During times like this I remember the old Miiverse days,” one fan waxed nostalgically. “If Miiverse existed now there would be a wave of upset players posting and/or making images (written posts/drawings) protesting against Nintendo’s decision.” We’ll see if <em>Mario Kart World </em>players can find other creative ways of protesting. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133]]></content:encoded>

These magical artefacts aren’t just for show either, as they will provide positive blessings for guests when well maintained… but watch out, those who don’t look after these intriguing curios will find they curse guests instead!</p><p>To discover these new magical exhibits on your expeditions, you’ll need to hire Fantasy Experts from Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue or Bard classes, each of whom possess their own stats. Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack? Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut. Whatever the obstacle, “Fantasy Finds” will challenge you to hire a varied party of fantasy experts with their own strengths and talents to ensure you successfully return home from expeditions with new magical exhibits.</p><p>That’s not all, as “Fantasy Finds” will also weave its fantasy magic throughout your museum with three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors and you’ll even see your expedition helicopter joining in the fun, thanks to a fresh paint job ensuring it fits the medieval fantasy mood.

We spoke to Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman to find out.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A viral hit made in South Korea">A viral hit made in South Korea</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaman tells us that Peak took shape during a game jam between Aggro Crab and Landfall. It's a tidbit both teams had already shared, but what we didn't know is that the entire production essentially took place during a month-long retreat in Seoul. Three members of the Aggro Crab team flew out to the South Korean capital to meet with four Landfall staffers, mimicking the process Landfall undertook when developing its previous release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/frontier-yanks-generative-ai-portraits-from-jurassic-world-evolution-3-after-fans-revolt" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frontier pulls generative AI portraits from Jurassic World Evolution 3 after fan backlash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every waking moment was either working on the game or talking about the game over KBBQ and soju. We locked in. We did have to learn each other’s work styles. Like how [Landfall lead designer] Wilhelm types only the letter 'f' for every git commit message because 'it's the fastest key to press on the keyboard.' Things like that," says Kaman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Collaboration was very natural, which was something I had to get used to as someone who's used to more rigorous production. People would just add whatever felt important or funny on a given day to the game, but with everyone's level of experience, there was a lot of trust in each other that those decisions made sense."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4bUA3UHajXE?si=Hirt6_Nf4hhA6lVX" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vast majority of production took place during that four-week period starting in February 2025, which meant both teams were able to add polish "at a slower pace" when they touched back down on home soil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaman explains there wasn't the need for a hard budget because it was obvious </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wouldn't cost much compared to a traditional indie project. That said, he estimates Aggro Crab and Landfall spent less than $200,000 overall—which he notes is "pretty doable" for two studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/riot-shutters-hypixel-studios-and-cancels-hytale-after-a-decade-in-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Riot shutters Hypixel Studios and cancels Hytale after a decade in development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was mainly just a couple months salaries and the Airbnb, flights, and food for Korea," he adds. The biggest challenge, says Kaman, wasn't financing or actually building the title, but rather agreeing on a direction for their initial concept. The team had taken to chatting over Discord before flying out to Korea, and that led to some combative discussions they've since come to blame on the fallibility of the written word.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew we wanted to make a game about lost scouts but there were so many directions the mechanics were being pulled in. We got into a few arguments in Discord, worried that if we didn’t get it right, we would end up stuck in Korea making a bad game we didn’t really believe in," he continues. "To our surprise, things clicked shortly after meeting up in person, where we figured out this is a game about free-form climbing and managing afflictions on your stamina bar. This led to a phrase we would say often: 'text is evil.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;This level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us&quot;">"This level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scope creep is another evil familiar to most developers, but Kaman explains Aggro Crab and Landfall swerved the issue by agreeing they would ship whatever they made in Korea.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-ratify-historic-contract-with-microsoft" target="_self" data-discover="true">ZeniMax union workers ratify historic contract with Microsoft</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To clarify, the game jam IS the game," he explains. "By the end of the month, the core gameplay was basically done and all that was left was to hook up the rest of the user experience, add meta-progression elements, and sneak in the banana peel. We avoided scope creep by having a built-in ship date: midsummer. I'm here now in Sweden to visit Landfall for the annual Swedish celebration, and we spent the first week of the trip putting the finishing touches on the game and launching it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was essentially in the bag, Aggro Crab and Landfall had to decide how to market and sell the title. That required both studios to place their trust in their community managers, who had spent years nurturing communities on TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew we'd be able to reach our audience," says Kaman, who explains the confidence both studios had in their community managers' ability to connect with their playerbase was partly why they chose to unveil and launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the space of five days.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You only really need to announce early to build up enough hype for that initial spark, but if you already know you’ll have that, then it’s just up to whether the game is good enough to turn that spark into a raging campfire," he adds. "We couldn’t have predicted this insane of a response of course! I think the large launch discount (38 percent) and the inherent virality of the game also helped make it easy to convince your friends to all pick it up"</span></p><p>Image via Aggro Crab / Landfall</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing pricing in more detail, Kaman says launching for less than $5 made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a very tantalizing "impulse spend." He explains that most players were pleasantly surprised at the scope and depth of the title considering the low price point and confirms the both studios subsequently broke even in a matter of hours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We thought if we were lucky it would eventually do half as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We broke even in the first few hours. Now that a week has passed we're at 1.6 million copies. It's absolutely bonkers and none of us expected it," Kaman continues. "We are freaking out. We knew we had a decent shot of success because of our platforms but this level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us. We’re attributing this win to the Power of Friendship."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, this is the second viral hit Landfall has delivered after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-nets-8-8m-players-in-two-months#">sold 2.2 million copies and attracted 8.8. million players in two months</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The reason for the discrepancy in those numbers is simple: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched as a free-to-keep title for a full day. That lead to around 6.2 million people downloading the co-op horror title in 24 hours and over 200,000 concurrent users on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Landfall and Aggro Crab considered doing something similar with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but ultimately decided it would be tough to replicate the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We found out recently that a lot of games have tried [that same approach] since [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched] and failed to hit the same level of success. We were anxious about whether we’d get results without a bold strategy like that, but this probably resulted in way more revenue than if we had done the free day," notes Kaman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how Landfall and Aggro Crab are sharing the spoils, Kaman explains both companies are taking cuts as co-publishers of the game. Each individual who worked on the project is also receiving their fair share. That sounds pretty peak to us.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Sony is being sued in a Dutch class action lawsuit over artificially inflated prices on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has been filed by Dutch non-profit organisation Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument on behalf of 1.7 million Dutch PlayStation users.</p>
<p>The organisation has accused Sony of "abusing its dominant position in the console market for at least a decade", according to a press release shared with Eurogamer. Due to the increased prevalence of digital sales and digital-only consoles, the organisation claims Sony has a monopoly over digital sales - what it has dubbed a "Sony Tax".</p>
<p>The lawsuit is part of the organisation's <a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/collectieve-acties/playstation/">"Fair PlayStation" campaign</a>, which it launched in February and attracted over 20,000 participants in its first week.</p>
<p>"Many people have noticed they're increasingly being pushed towards 'digital-only' consoles since the arrival of the latest PS5 generation," said Lucia Melcherts, chair of Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument.</p>
<p>"These consoles work exclusively with digital games rather than physical discs. Yet economic research shows that consumers pay on average 47 percent more for a digital version of a game compared to an identical physical copy - even though Sony's distribution costs are significantly lower."</p>
<p>In April this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of its PS5 console once again</a> in multiple countries, including the UK and across Europe. Now, the PS5 Digital Edition costs £40 or €50 more, which Sony blamed on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p>
<p>"The fact that Sony dares to raise prices by double digits without offering anything meaningful in return speaks volumes," said Melcherts. "Sony is the sole provider of digital content on the world’s most popular gaming console. With more than 80 percent of Dutch console owners using a PlayStation, Sony is free to make decisions with little regard for competitors, developers, or consumers."</p>
<p>In the summons sent to Sony by Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, there are two core accusations: the exclusion of competition, and the exploitation of consumers and game developers. The organisation claims PlayStation players are entirely dependent on Sony and its prices due to its closed ecosystem, while developers have limited commercial freedom with Sony setting prices.</p>
<p>Due to this "imbalance", Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument claims consumers are paying a premium - resulting in estimated damages in the Netherlands of up to €435m.</p>
<p>A first hearing will take place later this year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">legal claim made in the UK in 2022</a> by ex-managing director of Which UK Alex Neill, filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal. It claimed Sony was in breach of competition law due to a 30 percent commission on digital games and in-game purchases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/5bn-lawsuit-over-unfair-playstation-prices-may-continue-tribunal-rules">lawsuit was then given the go ahead in 2023</a>, and <a href="https://woodsford.com/woodsford-funded-5bn-class-action-against-sony-playstation-gets-go-ahead-in-uk-competition-appeal-tribunal/">earlier this year was given the green light to proceed to trial</a>.</p>
<p>Others in the industry have also received lawsuits over perceived monopolies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite recently returned to iOS devices in the US and Europe</a> following a lengthy battle between Epic and Apple over the latter's restrictions on purchasing methods. Meanwhile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition">Microsoft settled a lawsuit from players attempting to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> due to a perceived monopoly over the industry.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-in-netherlands-over-sony-tax-and-its-perceived-monopoly-on-digital-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>You survived a killer before, and somehow, you've found yourself in another hunted situation. You keep trying to save the others, but what's hunting you is too quick, and as before, you're the only one left. Once again, you are the final girl.</em></p>

<p><em>Final Girl</em>, by Van Ryder Games, was an acclaimed Kickstarter launched in 2020, based on their already successful <em>Hostage Negotiator</em>&nbsp;system. Since its release, it's had 2 more Kickstarters, each combined into a series of releases. In this review, we will look at the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box, which incorporates everything from Series 2 available at retail into a single handy storage box. If you want to know how to play <em>Final Girl</em>, check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review" rel="nofollow">Final Girl Ultimate Box Series 1 review</a>, because in this article, we'll just be looking at the Series 2 contents&nbsp;and what our favorite parts of it are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-6_0.jpg?itok=kDZp_mlO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-6_0.jpg?itok=6HZZt47C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box isn't incuded in the Series 2 Ultimate Box, but is in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, or can be picked up seperately for use with the Series 2 Ultimate Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Rules To Survive A Horror Movie Sequel</h2>

<p><i>Final Girl</i>&nbsp;is a modular system that begins with the <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box, which has the core rules and components. To play, a core box is combined with a feature film box, like Happy Trails Horror or Slaughter in the Groves. These feature film boxes include a unique killer, a unique location, and 2 final girls to choose from, which can all be mixed and matched with other feature film boxes in any combination of final girl, location, and killer to diversify your games as your collection expands.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box doesn't include a <em>Final Girl </em>Core Box. So if you don't have the Series 1 Ultimate Box, you will need to pick up a Core Box separately. This is to avoid duplication, as the Ultimate Boxes are designed for players who want everything. If you want to try out <em>Final Girl</em>, pick up a Core Box and a feature film to test the experience first, and then if you love it, then the Ultimate Boxes are going to be for you.</p>

<h2>What's Your Favorite Scary Movie Sequel?</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box contains a huge amount of content. We'll detail here what each item contains and talk about our favorite products from the Ultimate Box below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=z_KZBf1k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=Bfc8Rn1V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the Core Box, the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box includes a load of upgrades and content add-ons.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em> Box of Props</h4>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Box of Props includes a load of upgraded and extra components for <em>Final Girl</em>. It includes deluxe tokens for the horror track, bloodlust, and time, and solid plastic tokens for final health. It also includes a desperation dice, which you can choose to roll once per game instead of a red die for a 5 in 6 chance of an extra success, but a 1 in 6 chance of immediately losing. If you lose because of the desperation die, you can look up how you died in the included book of desperate deaths.</p>

<p>4 promo final girls are also included in the box, Layla, Agnes, and 2 tie-in characters from the upcoming <em>The Dark Quarter</em> game, Julia and Constance. They don't get special envelopes or miniatures in this box though, they come in the Series 3 Ultimate Box (I would have liked to see it all packaged up in this box together). Some new rules are also added for the characters, with signature action cards, which can be added to the game and function like normal action cards, and a choice of ultimate dice, which can be taken instead of unlocking your final girl's ultimate ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=Crh8IQoX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=k6dbWSHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box includes 5 new feature film boxes, with new locations, killers and final girls.</figcaption></figure><h4>Final Girl Feature Films Boxes</h4>

<p>The Series 2 Ultimate Box, like the first one, contains 5 feature film boxes, for a total of 5 locations, 5 killers, and 10 final girls (with 5 additional final girls and another killer we detail above and below) that can all be mixed and matched between sets. Each box also contains miniatures for the killer, to upgrade from the token in the core box and vehicles (that you can access with cards in the item and event decks), to upgrade from the tokens included in each feature film box. We'll discuss each feature film box below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Into the Void</strong></p>

<p>Into The Void is <em>Final Girl's</em> take on Alien, with the USS Konrad as the location, which has key card required access cards to move between parts of the ship, and the Evomorph as a killer that evolves over the course of the game. Ellen and Jenette are the final girls in this film box, with Ellen's ultimate always letting her find what she needs, and Jenette getting extra uses out of limited items. I love that this set includes the Super Loader (and miniature in the Ultimate Box) for enhanced combat damage when looking to take the fight to the Evomorph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Panic at Station 2891</strong></p>

<p>Panic at Station 2891 includes Station 2891 as a remote location that has a helicopter on a timer as the only way to save victims. It also includes indoor and outdoor spaces that use the rule for frostbite, should you or the victims stay in the elements too long. The Organism is the killer in this set, and it has 3 different variations. 3 victims may have been assimilated, and as many as all 3 could be an Organism. The final girls are Uki and Kate. Uki's ultimate is to always be considered to have the Guard card that can reduce damage, and Kate jumps back to full health when revealing her ultimate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: A Knock at the Door</strong></p>

<p>A Knock at the Door has the Wingard Cottage as its location, which gives you access to crafting mechanics to combine items into more powerful weapons. The Intruders are the killers here, with 3 killers on the board, with only the active killer performing actions, until an All Killers card is drawn. Ava and Ginny are the final girls here, with Ava's ultimate letting you reroll a blank (1) horror roll, and Ginny's ultimate boosting her actions for the rest of the game.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Once Upon a Full Moon</strong></p>

<p>Once Upon a Full Moon takes a fantasy turn with the Storybook Woods as the location, which is much smaller than other locations, and requires you to cross poorly built bridges or find the raft. The Big Bad Wolf is the killer, and has 2 different modes, track and slay, with actions depending on which mode they are in. The fantastically thematic Red and Gretel are the final girls in this set, with Red's ultimate letting her move if an enemy is within 2 spaces, and Gretel's ultimate converting a blank (2) horror roll to a star by discarding action cards.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Madness in the Dark</strong></p>

<p>Madness in the Dark takes place at the Wolfe Asylum location, which has risk-reward medicine and drugs that can help you against the killer. The killer in this set is the Ratchet Lady, who can turn victims into maniacs to help her hunt you down. Veronica and Heather are the final girls, with Veronica's ultimate resetting the time to 7 at the end of the planning phase, and Heather's ultimate letting her reroll 5 or 6 on the horror roll, and boosting her attacks for each success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=wpi3bB19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=OMMZBI5P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box game mats are different from those in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, with extra spaces for feature film rules.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Game Mat bundle</h4>

<p>The game mat bundle includes 2 neoprene game mats that have space for all the game areas, including the killer and location boards, horror and time track, and card deck areas, and comes in a thematic VCR-style box. These mats are slightly different from the Series 1 mats, and have more spaces for cards and components, but at the cost of things being a little more cramped together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=gA5Owel1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=1pricLq8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Following the same format as the&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box, the Series 2 Ultimate Box includes a whole host of extras to add more depth to your games.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Bonus Features Box</h4>

<p>Along with the Feature and Core boxes, the Ultimate Box includes 2 other sets, the first is the Bonus Features Box, which includes several books:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl</em>: S2&nbsp;Feature Films Rulebook&nbsp;- This handy book features all the killer and location looseleaf rules inserts from each of the Series 2&nbsp;feature films, along with some achievement sheets for each, and works the same way as the Series 1 book.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: S2&nbsp;Gruesome Death Books - These 5&nbsp;books for each location contain gruesome details of kills for each terror card and some general death details, for each of the Series 2&nbsp;killers across the Series 2&nbsp;locations.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Lore Book Series 2 - The lore book contains background details for all of the Series 2&nbsp;killers and final girls, along with some detailed setup for some linked scenario games</li>
</ul><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Cast and Crew Box</h4>

<p>The other bonus set in the Ultimate Box is the The Series 2 Cast and Crew, which is a handy storage box for some additional components, and to gather up all the final girl stat cards and their secret envelopes (which you can open for a bonus card once you complete a game with that final girl). The box also contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl </em>Miniatures - All of the killer miniatures are housed in their respective feature film boxes, but all of the final girl miniatures are here.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Terror from the Grave (vignette) - This fantastic little box contains a killer (zombies) but doesn't include a specific location (and as with all killers, can be used with any location you wish). It also includes a new final girl (who also has a miniature in this box), Patsy, whose ultimate allows her to spend 2 time to deal 2 damage.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Zombies Miniatures Pack - These miniatures replace the tokens in the Terror from the Grave vignette pack.</li>
</ul><h2>A Bloody Combination</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box further adds an insane amount of variety in locations and killers, if added to the Series 1 Ultimate Box, but still stands alone and can simply be added to a Core Set if you just want to play the Feature Films in this box. Having to pick up the Core Set separately makes sense, as does the miniatures for the 2 tie-in final girls from <em>The Dark Quarter </em>(which I love, as the final girls are powerful and the tie in is handled well), but not having the miniatures and secret envelopes for the other 2 extra final girls who's promo cards are included feels off, and having to buy the Series 3 Ultimate Box to get them doesn't sit well. If you're a huge fan of <em>Final Girl</em>, you're probably picking it up anyway, but for something called the Ultimate Box, it doesn't feel very ultimate.</p>

<p>Aside from that, some of the content here is fantastic. Into the Void and Panic at Station 2891 are incredible, with thematic locations and killers, and the zombies from Terror from the Grave are fun. But it's Once Upon a Full Moon that's my favorite part of the content. The fairy tale horror includes my favorite location, killer and final girls so far.</p>



<p>If you've read the above and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review" rel="nofollow">Final Girl Ultimate Box Series 1 review</a>, you'll know that I'm a fan of the <em>Final Girl</em> mechanics and the sheer depth of variety that a single Ultimate Box can give you. Having 2 Ultimate Boxes just increases that, but will also stand on its own (with the addition of a Core Box with the Series 2 Ultimate Box).</p>

<p>I love the originality of the core horror feature films in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, but the Series 2 Ultimate Box is easily my pick of the 2, with Into the Void and Panic a Station 2891 being great experiences, but Once Upon a Full Moon being my favorite. The missing miniatures and sealed envelopes for 2 promo final girls sours it a little (they're in the Series 3 Ultimate Box), but the 2 tie in characters from A Dark Quarter are fantastic (but you will have to pick up a copy of that game for the miniatures - which we'll review when released).&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-three-more-old-school-worms-games.1229001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>on consoles, bringing three more retro&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>titles to the collection, as well as a new cheat code that will be familiar if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the "Backworms Compatible Update" adds the SNES and Genesis (or Mega Drive for some regions) ports of&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, as well as the Game Boy Advance game&nbsp;<em>Worms World Party</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, this update brings the legendary "Boggy B" cheat code for&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, which will unlock all of the game's content. This one was added by request of the community, and you can toggle it within the collection's options menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-new-games-castle.jpg?itok=Ok-hYrk8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-new-games-castle.jpg?itok=no_y-84N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>now has new&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>games for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, since this is an update specifically for&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, this extra stuff isn't coming to the PC version of the game, which is still just the old-fashioned classic&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon&nbsp;</em>release from the mists of 1999.</p>

<p>It's nice to see Team17 still working on updating&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</em>, but it does feel like a shame that the PC version isn't getting the same love. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if the community's voice becomes loud enough to change that.</p>

<p>If you've never played&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon</em>&nbsp;(or its console re-release), it's a classic 1999 strategy game that sees teams of worms battling it out for supremacy using a variety of comically dangerous weapons, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worms-rumble-release-date-playstation-pc-crossplay-beta-announced-" rel="nofollow">many</a> of its franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/worms-wmd-review-worm-has-returned" rel="nofollow">stablemates</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>re-release packs in not only the original game (plus modern hardware improvements, natch), but also a digital&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>museum and documentary, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the game.</p>




<p><em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009765" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition/9nh5hhr5w9wx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Worms-Armageddon-Anniversary-Edition-2655288.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

There's a reason Diablo Immortal's version of the Druid uses wildfire-inducing fire magic and earthquake-creating earth magic, two elements that can spiral out of control and wreak havoc on the surrounding environment.</p><p dir="ltr">"At Blizzard generally, not even just on this team, we talk a lot about what is the right time for this class, what is the right time for this zone?" Diablo Immortal senior narrative designer Ryan Quinn said in an interview with GameSpot. "Knowing that we're going to this densely wooded place where Druids and witches fight over how to share the land…not to channel too much of the fact that I live in southern California, but a wildfire seems very, very poised to create tension and conflict in that environment."</p><p dir="ltr">While the class maintains many of the familiar aspects of the Druid that fans of the class from previous installments will be familiar with--elemental spellcasting, shapeshifting abilities, and animal companions--how Diablo Immortal's Druid actually looks and plays will be quite different. The class puts an emphasis on constantly transitioning between forms, whether it's diving into the fray as a werebear, repositioning and crowd-controlling enemies as the new stag form, or dissolving into a swarm of dive-bombing ravens.</p><p dir="ltr">Quinn said Blizzard knew this new version of the Druid needed to feel different. Part of realizing that goal came in the form of the Druid's new shapeshifting abilities, going beyond the usual werebear and werewolf forms.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to do stuff that's a little more diverse, we didn't want to just do predator forms," Quinn said. "And we wanted it to look and feel more chaotic."</p><p dir="ltr">Quinn used an example of how earlier in development, the Druid simply transformed into a single raven. But that didn't feel powerful enough, so the team instead opted for the Druid to transform into an entire flock of ravens. That line of thinking can be seen throughout the Druid's toolkit, where each ability feels like it's ready to spiral out of control.</p><p dir="ltr">It also translates to the Druid's gameplay. Blizzard's goal was to make Diablo Immortal's Druid more agile than previous versions, lead systems engineer John Yoo said, with an emphasis on constantly shapeshifting.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to encourage people to have dynamic play by swapping in and out of forms, using abilities," Yoo said. "We wanted it to feel very, very active."</p><p dir="ltr">Players don't have to always be swapping in and out of forms and can be successful just playing as more of a straight spellcaster or sticking to one form, Yoo said. While sticking to one playstyle will be "viable," Yoo said those who want to push the class to its limits and maximize their damage will likely want to change forms depending on the situation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521861"></a><figcaption>In addition to shapeshifting, Diablo Immortal's Druid can wield primal earth and fire magic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For fans of older versions of Diablo's Druid, there are still some throwbacks to what fans already know. Diablo Immortal's Druid can use fire magic, like in Diablo 2, and has similar summonable companions, like direwolves (although Yoo said the team did experiment with summonable direboars instead). Quinn said since Diablo Immortal takes place between Diablo 2 and 3, the team is always aware of the legacy preceding the mobile ARPG. With that in mind, Blizzard looks to strike a balance when it comes honoring what came before while also making room for new ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">"Occasionally it is take the familiar thing [in] a very familiar direction," Quinn said. "Sometimes, it's just add. Take the familiar thing, but bolt something new and cool onto it that doesn't contradict it. And sometimes it's whole cloth invention."</p><p dir="ltr">One example of that philosophy in action is the return of the Druid's Oak Sage ability. Previously seen in Diablo 2, Oak Sage is back in Diablo Immortal. Instead of a more passive aura like in Diablo 2, the Oak Sage in Diablo Immortal is instead punched up and depicted as a friendly forest fae that boosts players' health and defense but also attacks enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to push the boundaries, make our Druid feel different from other Druids," Yoo said. "While we wanted to keep the inherent theme and nature of the Druid, no pun intended, we still wanted to make it unique, fresh, and distinctly our own in Diablo Immortal."</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of the Druid is just the latest in a series of updates outlined in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-2025-roadmap-reveals-another-new-class-is-on-the-way/1100-6530052/" data-ref-id="1100-6530052">Diablo Immortal's 2025 roadmap</a> Blizzard has dubbed the Epoch of Madness, all of which continue to explore the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-biggest-boss-battle-yet-is-fittingly-against-diablo-himself/1100-6528355/" data-ref-id="1100-6528355">defeat of Diablo last year</a> and the power vacuum left in his wake. A fourth major update currently shrouded in mystery, titled The First &amp; Last King, is slated to arrive later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4, meanwhile, continues to evolve, as Blizzard looks to update the ARPG's endgame. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Season 8 overhauled Diablo 4's endgame bosses</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">Season 9 brings permanent changes to Nightmare dungeons</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sega is now the official gaming partner of McLaren Racing, in a multi-year collaboration with Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with Eurogamer, the partnership promises to "fuse the worlds of motorsport and gaming and engage audiences of all ages both on the grid and screen". It's unknown exactly what this will entail, but it's all part of Sonic Team's 2025 "<a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a>" campaign.</p>
<p>The partnership will continue into 2026, Sonic's 35th anniversary year, as well as the McLaren Formula 1 team's 1,000th Grand Prix race.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time the two companies have joined forces. Back in 1993, the European Grand Prix was held in Donington Park in the UK and was known as the Sonic Grand Prix. McLaren F1 driver Ayrton Senna won the race and received a Sonic the Hedgehog trophy.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to welcome Sonic the Hedgehog to the McLaren Racing family," said Louise McEwen, chief marketing officer of McLaren Racing. "This partnership brings together two iconic names in speed, and opens up our team to a wider, younger global audience. Sonic is a character with incredible heritage and a passionate fanbase, and we are very excited to celebrate our partnership at McLaren Racing Live: London."</p>
<p>The McLaren Racing Live event will take place in Trafalgar Square from 2nd - 3rd July.</p>
<p>The collaboration underlines Sega's key release for the year, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The next in the racing series, it features mid-race portals to other worlds to shake up gameplay, as well as including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Hatsune Miku, Persona's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve in its roster of racers</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a Sega Arcade racer, with the mechanical depth and tightened controls you'd expect from that lineage," wrote Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. "It's also a mad party game to boot."</p>
<p>The partnership also proves the brand power of Sonic and Sega, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">blue blur's star has risen over the past decade</a> through well-received games and films.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sega has partnered with an F1 team, either. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarrely-atlus-will-sponsor-haas-for-this-weeks-f1-singapore-grand-prix-in-honour-of-metaphor-refantazio">Atlus sponsored F1 team Haas last year</a> to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. Why? Both the team and the game share a Hulkenberg.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 8.0 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> today for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, adding several features and new content. The main addition is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siege Mode</a>, a new PvE mode that expands on the existing Operations mode to include endless enemy waves that can challenge even the strongest teams. When players are overwhelmed, they can call for reinforcements. They'll engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring a different strategy. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing the resources needed to summon either elite Space Marines or the formidable Dreadnought, which can drastically shift the balance of power on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Compared to the build previously available for testing on the Public Test Server, Saber Interactive has reworked the wave timer limit so that, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can become very short on higher waves, there is now a timer for the entire session. Each time players beat a wave, the timer increases.</p>
<p>The developers of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 have also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves, meaning that enemies will become stronger more quickly after the 15th wave. These changes will ensure players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Additionally, the timer may be entirely removed in the future. Moreover, an option has been introduced to disable bot spawning in Private Mode.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 also received some major technical improvements for the PC version. There's now an experimental ray traced ambient occlusion feature (RTAO) that can be toggled on in the graphics settings, and NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is now fully supported, delivering better visuals with the latest transformer model and faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

<p>There are also many other balance tweaks and additions in the patch. Last but not least, Saber said they are preparing a significant update to the customization system, which will let players reuse chapter champion armor parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping, and technical restrictions). This will be in a future update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 7 million units sold, and the developers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Umami Tiger and publisher Deck13 have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the upcoming story expansion DLC for the JRPG-inspired throwback&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will launch across all platforms on August 7th, and that's also when you'll be able to purchase the soundtrack for the DLC if you're musically inclined.</p>

<p>As Umami Tiger (which is essentially just a moniker for solo dev Matthias Linda) says,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled to arrive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025" rel="nofollow">in the second quarter of the year</a>, but "game development is complicated".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=PzOgomru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=vvQzRXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Echoes</em>'&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is arriving in August.</figcaption></figure><p>Linda says that while the DLC itself was ready for release at the end of Q2, "translations were not", and more testing was additionally needed in order to "iron out the last small issues" with&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;you'll get for your money (since&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>isn't a free DLC), it'll add "more of what you enjoyed so much" the first time around.</p>

<p>You'll be getting a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf, a vicious fighter with plenty of damaging moves to test out. Additionally, you can look forward to new areas to visit, as well as "over 40 new enemies and bosses" to battle.</p>

<p>More music will, of course, be added to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC, and you can also expect new gear to collect and new minigames to try out. All in all, if you liked&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, you'll probably want to give this a look.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a throwback JRPG inspired by classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>and SNES-era&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>games. Developed by solo creator Matthias Linda, the game takes you to a "fantasy world where dragons are as common as piloted mechanical suits".</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003362" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can take a look at our very own Isaac's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/chained-echoes-review" rel="nofollow">review from back in 2022 right here</a>.</p>

            <p>Ok, so you remember how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> arrived on PC and immediately there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">more smutty mods</a> than you could shake a fleshy stick at?</p>
<p>Well, the new Zone Kit modding tools <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> got as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">yesterday's big patch</a> have done something similar, but with memey jank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd expect given the Zone Kit takes up a very small 700GB of your hard drive and only came out the other day, there aren't too many mods out there that make use of it. However, taking a glance at how its <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2?date_live=Last+year">Mod.IO</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1643320/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a> pages are building up at this early stage, there are still a number of works that'll, er, transform your zoning experience.</p>
<p>Homing in on Mod.IO specifically, 19 of the 61 mods currently up on there are by the same author, Sanekum, whom <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-artist-kickstarts-the-zone-kit-modding-scene-with-a-flood-of-glorious-nonsense-mods-featuring-shrek-cj-and-you-guessed-it-thomas-the-tank-engine/">PC Gamer</a> note looks like they could be GSC 3D Artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/sanekum">Aleksandr Silantev</a>.</p>
<p>That 31.15% (I have double checked the maths) of the total Stalker mods on the platform include the likes of <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/swampboss2#description">Shrek</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/cj-bloodsucker#description">CJ</a> from San Andreas cameos, but as a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-i-saw-her">serious</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">journalist</a> I'm interested in keeping things <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>. To that end, Sanekum offers the chance to pick up an <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/rpg-melee-combat#description">RPG grenade</a>, or an even deadlier <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/melee-nettle-branch#description">nettle branch</a>, and attempt to beat to death some <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sherman-boar#description">Sherman tanks</a> that've been drafted in to replace boars.</p>
<p>What do you mean that's not <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>? Clearly the Sherman tanks are being operated by the boars, who've just been magicked inside of them and given the sort of army training required to operate an armoured fighting vehicle with their little hooves. In the same way that <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sidorovich-handgun#description">this mod</a> which turns a mini-Sidorovich into a handgun makes perfect anatomical sense.
</p>
<p>Aside from those, a fair few of these early Mod.IO works for Stalker look to be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1312">existing</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/634">things</a> from places like Nexus Mods being <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/weapon-reposition-project-tacticool#description">ported</a> <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/main-menu-animated-ferris-wheel-4k60fps#description">across</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be cool to see what Stalker's notoriously enthusiastic modding community can get up to once they've had time to buy an entire new PC just to ensure they've got the space needed to install the Zone Kit and a chance to play around with it properly. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-some-nettles-defeat-wild-pigs-in-sherman-tanks-thanks-to-stalker-2s-new-modding-tools-you-can-find-out]]></content:encoded>
