			<p>Right at the end of 2025, as <strong>Amazon's</strong> second season of its successful <strong>Fallout TV show </strong>adaptation was airing, a report appeared to identify the next TV show adaptation Amazon would be pulling out of the Fallout franchise: <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show/">a reality TV show competition based on <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong></a>. Well, that report has been proven true, as Amazon confirmed today that it is developing a reality TV competition show based on Fallout Shelter, where contestants will test their nuclear apocalypse survival skills for a cash prize.</p>



<p>The news was revealed in a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a>, which confirmed that the series will begin with <strong>10 episodes</strong> and that <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting for the series has officially opened</a>. According to the show's logline, this new reality TV competition show is "<em>Set inside Vault-Tec’s bomb-proof vaults, ‘Fallout Shelter’ drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games’ signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling. Across a series of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral crossroads, contestants must prove their ingenuity, teamwork, and resilience as they compete for safety, power, and ultimately a huge cash prize</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society.

</div></figure>



<p>The casting page for the show adds that contestants will be tested on challenges all to do with seven core attributes players can upgrade in the games: Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L). </p>



<p>"<em>The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances</em>," the casting page reads. "<em>It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L?</em>"</p>



<p>The report adds that the show will feature "<em>deeply social, psychological, and narrative-driven gameplay</em>," to match the "<em>choice-driven ethos</em>" of the games. Bethesda's <strong>James Altman</strong> and <strong>Todd Howard</strong> are both signed on as executive producers on the show, alongside Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, Jack Burgess, Toni Ireland, Stephen Yemoh, Stephen Lovelock and Amina Badresingh from Studio Lambert.</p>



<p>If you think you have what it takes to survive the nuclear apocalypse in this reality show, then you can send in your <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting form at the link here</a>. If you're looking for something Fallout-related to keep you in the Fallout mindset for the show, then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">beyond checking out the second season </a>of the original TV show adaptation and diving back into<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/"> Fallout 4 with the Anniversary Edition</a>, you can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">rumoured remasters of <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong></a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sequel to Subway Surfers, Subway Surfer City, releases on February 26, 2026; interested players can pre-register now. </p>



<p>Subway Surfers is undoubtedly not only one of the most popular endless runners out there, but also one of the most-played mobile games. I know I have spent hours on end trying achieve the highest score and beat all my friends. Fans of this game can now look forward to a brand new sequel, which introduces a lot of new stuff. </p>







<h2 id="h-subway-surfers-city-release-date-revealed">Subway Surfers City Release Date Revealed </h2>



<p>Revealed through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/subwaysurfers/status/2011831031184138243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Subway Surfers City arrives next month with new gameplay mechanics, game modes, challenges, and improved visuals. A new press release on <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115285583/en/SYBO-Announces-Subway-Surfers-City-The-Long-Awaited-Next-Chapter-to-Subway-Surfers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Wire</a> by the developer SYBO reveals some of the new mechanics players will be able to try out. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Time to gear up. 🏙️</p><p>Join the crew. Be part of the movement.</p><p>Subway Surfers City expands the journey into Subway City with new gameplay mechanics and modes, handcrafted challenges, and stunning visuals.</p><p>🎮 Pre-register now: <a href="https://t.co/xCJUIT1hcF">https://t.co/xCJUIT1hcF</a><br>📅 Launching Feb 26… <a href="https://t.co/BhCN8XFZg2">pic.twitter.com/BhCN8XFZg2</a></p></div>— Subway Surfers (@subwaysurfers) <a href="https://twitter.com/subwaysurfers/status/2011831031184138243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The game will introduce a “<strong>stomp move</strong>” that can be used to reveal hidden advantages, a “<strong>bouncy bubblegum shield</strong>” that can enhance your jump abilities, and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, there are three new modes to look forward to once Subway Surfers City is released. <strong>Classic Endless</strong>, the endless runner experience where players chase new high scores. The <strong>City Tour</strong>, which is a finite game mode where players will progress through levels, complete goals and explore districts while completing missions and finding hidden stars. Lastly, there is the <strong>Events</strong> mode, which will feature a rotation of finite runs and trials. </p>



<p>The original Subway Surfers game crossed 4.5 billion lifetime downloads in 2025, making it the most downloaded mobile game of all time, so the sequel has some pretty big shoes to fill. </p>



<p>Interested readers can pre-register for Subway Surfers City prior to its release on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sybogames.subway.surfers.game&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/subway-surfers-city/id6504188939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iOS App Store</a>. </p>

                <p>Another Fallout show is in the works for Prime Video, though it'll be quite different from the popular scripted drama starring Walton Goggins. Amazon is developing a competition series with the working title Fallout Shelter, and the company just put out a casting call online.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">casting call</a>, contestants (or "dwellers") will "live together in a top-secret vault" and compete in games related to "core attributes" from the Fallout universe. Loyalty and alliances between dwellers will also be tested, with an official Fallout X account describing the game as containing "escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums." Casting applications close on February 15.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/2011835665261216027?s=20" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers!

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Steam Hardware Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>Games earn the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-verified-program-expanding-to-other-hardware-running-steamos-like-legion-go-s/1100-6531502/" data-ref-id="1100-6531502">Steam Deck Verified label</a> after testing by Valve. Being verified isn't necessarily an indicator that a game will run flawlessly on the handheld device, but rather that it checks off requirements of full controller compatibility, proper display settings, and middleware support.</p><p>From Valve's perspective, any game that meets those requirements on Steam Deck is good to go on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-machine-has-overlap-with-traditional-consoles-but-its-not-one/1100-6536196/" data-ref-id="1100-6536196">more console-like Steam Machine</a>. Valve hasn't offered any more specific details about technical requirements for Steam Machine Verification.</p><p>Games that lack that marketable green checkmark badge might still be playable on Steam Deck; they just might be missing one of the main requirements. Some games like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 were initially Steam Deck Verified by Valve before being recategorized as "Playable" due to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-deck/spider-man-2-rating-demoted" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">graphical and performance issues</a>.</p><p>In the same interview with Game Developer, Yang mentioned that the verification process for the company's Steam Frame VR headset will be different, but Valve will still "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback." Valve has still yet to announce dates and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-price-valve-may-have-just-given-the-best-clue-yet/1100-6536462/" data-ref-id="1100-6536462">prices for the Steam Machine</a> and Steam Frame, other than a vague 2026 release window.</p>

                <p>The ongoing RAM shortages and the associated increase in RAM prices are starting to affect other pieces of hardware that make use of fast memory. Graphics cards are especially susceptible, which has seemingly forced Nvidia to start discontinuing at least two 50-series cards that ship with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>A report by Hardware Unboxed states that several GPU manufactueres have designated both the RTX 5070Ti and the 16GB version of the RTX 5060Ti as "end of life," meaning that no new stock is being produced. At CES 2026, Asus, one of the largest AIB partners Nvidia works with, confirmed stock of the two cards was difficult to acquire from Nvidia and that current stock of both cards would be the last until further notice.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yteN21aJEvE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The report mentions that Asus is not alone in this decision, and that several other manufacturers and retailers (specifically across Australia) have noted the same for existing stock of both SKUs. The RTX 5070, which features 12GB of VRAM, seems unaffected for now, while cheaper cards with 8GB of VRAM, such as the regular RTX 5060, will continue to be produced. That leaves the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 as the only cards part of this generation of Nvidia GPUs that ship with 16GB or more VRAM, with both still only available at inflated prices.</p><p>Hardware Unboxed notes that Nvidia was expected to announce a 50-series refresh at CES 2026, but opted to delay the launch of these newer 50-series Super cards to an unspecified date. It's suggested in the report that if RAM pricing doesn't stabilize in the near future that this launch could be cancelled altogether, leaving few options for those looking to either build or upgrade a gaming PC that is well-equipped for most modern and demanding titles.</p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake has been in the pipeline for years from Ubisoft, but reports suggest that the sands of time could be running out on its release date—courtesy of a shadow drop.</p>



<p>A shadow drop never goes amiss. Last year’s Oblivion Remastered shadow drop drama was absolute cinema. When the moment came for Bethesda to drop one of the greatest RPGs ever onto all of our laps at a moment’s notice, the world lost its mind. The long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-rated-by-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> isn’t <em>quite </em>on that level, but it would be incredible if Ubisoft dropped a late Christmas present.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Mystery. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming cannot confirm or deny the existence of a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake shadow drop happening imminently, but it would line up with the reported belief of a <strong>mid-January 2026</strong> release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re an Insider Gaming regular, you know the site’s coverage of Ubisoft titles is exceptional. If you’re new here, IG has followed The Sands of Time Remake’s journey since the beginning. An exclusive story even revealed everything about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sands of Time Remake</a> and its shaky development.</p>







<p>On May 14, 2025, it was confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Would Release by April 2026</a>. Suddenly, we’re not too far from the end of the window.</p>



<p>After that, Insider Gaming dropped another exclusive, featuring an update on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sands of Time Remake update</a>. Sources revealed that the Sands of Time Remake was targeting a ‘<strong>mid-January 2026′</strong> launch. It’s believed that Ubisoft wanted to release the POP: The Sands of Time Remake before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a>, and this could be the case.</p>



<p>But drama unfolded on January 15, when a report from the <a href="https://x.com/popuniverseX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@popuniverseX</a> account (which has been suspended as a result) revealed that a ton of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time images and files were uploaded between December 31, 2025, and January 13, 2026.</p>



<p>The most intriguing file was one that had “game-release-tomorrow” in it! </p>



<p>Make of this what you will. Can Insider Gaming say for certain that a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake is happening for certain? No. But don’t be surprised if Ubisoft suddenly drops the announcement in the coming days.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/online-mod-for-rockstars-classic-bully-is-abruptly-taken-down-after-one-month/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>A PC mod that added online gameplay to Rockstar’s 2006 school-exploration title <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/10/bully/"><em>Bully</em></a> was abruptly taken down on Wednesday, roughly a month after it was first made available. While the specific reason for the “Bully Online” takedown hasn’t been publicly discussed, a <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964">message posted by the developers</a> to the project’s now-defunct Discord server clarifies that “this was not something we wanted.”</p>
<p>The Bully Online mod was spearheaded by Swegta, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SWEGTA/videos">Rockstar-focused YouTuber</a> who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-may-not-have-bully-2-but-this-fan-made-bully-online-mod-may-be-the-next-best-thing">formally announced the project in October</a> as a mod that “allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more.”</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Swegta said the mod was “a project me and my team have been working on for a very long time” and that early access in December would be limited to those who contributed at least $8 to a Ko-Fi account. When December actually rolled around, though, a message on Swegta.com (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260113025609/https://swegta.com/">archived</a>) suggested that the mod was being released freely as an open source project, with a registration page (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260114160805/https://swegta.com/online/">archived</a>) offering new accounts to anyone.</p>
<p>That source code has now been completely removed from Swegta.com, along with any webpages referencing the project or offering downloads for the mod’s custom launcher. On Discord, the team said that development of any Bully Online scripts would stop and that any account data created by users would be deleted.</p>

            <guid>1407286</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Star Trek has always been my church. I recognize how offensive this might sound to some people of faith, but it’s the honest truth. My parents, who came from different religious backgrounds, agreed to raise me and my sister in a secular household, and growing up, episodes of <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> became my Bible stories. Star Trek instilled in me many of the same values that are taught in houses of worship across the world, but in my faith, there is no God to judge or punish me—I learned how to rely on my own moral compass and inner strength. Last year, Skydance Media bought my church.</p><p>The ideals espoused in its text may be lofty and anti-capitalist, but Star Trek is a product, and has been since Lucille Ball bought the first pilot from creator Gene Roddenberry in 1965. It’s been in the hands of soulless business machines since at least 1968, when the Desilu library was purchased by industrial conglomerate Gulf+Western, who had recently gobbled up the storied Paramount Pictures. During the 1970s, Roddenberry parlayed his canceled TV show into a second career on the college lecture circuit, stoking the show’s passionate audience into the first modern pop culture fandom, a social club with conventions around the world and an insatiable appetite for branded merchandise. That movement gave birth to one of the seminal franchise reboots, as Trek returned not just to television but the big screen, eventually becoming one of the “crown jewels” of the Paramount portfolio.</p><blockquote>As easy as it was to divest financially from Star Trek, divesting emotionally is proving much more difficult.</blockquote><p>The asset that is Star Trek is now in the hands of Paramount Skydance, a merger of the century-old studio and the relatively young media corporation founded by born billionaire Larry Ellison, who have been co-producing projects since 2016, including two Trek features. Since the merger was finalized last year, Ellison has been utterly transparent in his pandering to US President Donald Trump, an old friend of Larry’s father, Oracle co-founder David Ellison. The new Paramount’s first act of fealty was <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/paramount-will-pay-16-million-in-settlement-with-trump-over-60-minutes-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>granting Trump a $16 million settlement</u></a> in his frivolous lawsuit against CBS news magazine <em>60 Minutes</em>, in which he claimed the program deliberately defamed him in favor of opposing presidential candidate Kamala Harris, causing him “mental anguish.” Just days later, CBS cancelled <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, whose host is a tireless Trump critic. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/stephen-colbert-late-show-skydance?ref=aftermath.site"><u>It’s been speculated</u></a> that both of these acts were done in exchange for easier merger approval from the FCC. Just weeks ago, CBS’s new embarrassingly Trump-friendly new director <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/controversial-60-minutes-segment-on-trump-immigration-policy-leaks-online?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bari Weiss shelved a <em>60 Minutes</em> segment</u></a> that interviewed victims of brutal abuse at the US prison in El Salvador where Trump has been deporting — well, whoever he wants — despite the story having been fact-checked and cleared with the network’s attorneys.</p><p>This is the company that, for the foreseeable future, stands to profit from the massive library of Star Trek stories about tolerance, curiosity, honor, and social justice, as well as from any forthcoming entries. Canceling my Paramount+ subscription was not a tough decision. But as easy as it was to divest financially from Star Trek, divesting emotionally is proving much more difficult.</p><p>Being a Trekkie has been a crucial part of my identity for my entire life. It’s one of the lenses through which I view the world and, even since childhood, it’s been one of the ways I invite people to get to know me. My love of Star Trek is deeply tied to my love of<em> sharing</em> Star Trek, of curating episode guides for specific friends, of writing columns or reviews with the aim of demystifying this dense mythology for curious newcomers. I was lucky enough to do this professionally for a few years, writing regularly about Star Trek for websites like Fanbyte, Looper, and Polygon. Between 2020 and 2025 I wrote dozens of reviews, interviews, and retrospectives praising its glories and dissecting its many, many failures. 2026, being Trek’s 60th anniversary, offered ample opportunity to get back into Trekkie missionary work again, if not for money then at least for the joy of it.</p><p>Now, by the very standards of the fictional heroes I wish to celebrate, I don’t feel that I can do that.</p><blockquote>As a fan, you are at best a stockholder — at worst, a tenant.</blockquote><p>There’s an ugly truth that you learn when you get into the modern economy of media journalism or criticism. As far as the corporations you cover are concerned, you are an extension of marketing. You keep the conversation going around a product. You draw eyes to it, and you engage its audience between releases. Even if your feedback about the product is negative — and mine frequently is — you are helping to sustain the brand. That’s why you’re granted access to screeners and talent interviews, even, for example, after <a href="https://observer.com/2023/04/star-trek-picard-finale-review-to-not-so-boldly-go-backwards/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>your scathing and spoiler-filled review</u></a> of the series finale to <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> is accidentally published early. You’re part of the team.</p><p>In hindsight, this reads as ridiculous, self-aggrandizing, stooge-like behavior. As if artists and entertainers don’t already have an inflated idea of the social value of their work, the idea that a critic or commentator should feel proud of his tertiary involvement <em>after the fact</em> is ludicrous. But this is a symptom of the way I – and to an extent, <em>all of us </em>— have been taught to relate to media. Art compels us to invest part of ourselves into it, and under capitalism, artists <em>need</em> us to do so. Entertainers curate fanbases not only out of the joy of building community or the desire to boost their egos, but to ensure their continued employment. They are incentivized to involve us. And when art becomes the property and concern of massive corporations, it’s now the corporations who profit from that loyalty.&nbsp;</p><p>The people discussing the teaser trailers for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> aren’t fans of actor Chris Evans or screenwriters Chris Markus &amp; Steve McFeely or (god forbid) directors Anthony &amp; Joe Russo, they are fans of <em>Marvel</em>. Your cousin with the Stitch tattoo isn’t a fan of writer/artist Chris Sanders, they’re a fan of <em>Disney</em>. And in the above paragraphs, despite expounding on my love for television shows called <em>Star Trek</em>, I have failed to mention showrunners Gene Coon, Michael Piller, Ira Steven Behr, Michelle Paradise, or Mike McMahan. These are some of the most prominent of the literal thousands of creative professionals who have shaped the fantasy world around which I’ve built myself. They are writers who have enriched my life, but rather than being a fan of theirs, I am a fan of<em> Star Trek</em>.</p><p>This is a <em>disease</em>, and if you’re reading this, you’ve probably got it. If not for a media franchise or a fictional character, then perhaps for a sports team. At some point in your youth, you imprinted on this amorphous thing, a ship of Theseus that you’ve continued to love even after its every component has been replaced. Everything about it has changed, except that it’s <em>yours</em>.</p><p>Nevermind that it isn’t yours, and it never was. You are at best a stockholder — at worst, a tenant. The modern media economy dictates that you are, most likely, paying a subscription to access or license whatever it is you love to watch, play, or listen to, and only a sliver of the proceeds will find their way to the artists who move you to do so. Instead, that value is passed up the chain to the financiers and executives, to whom the art you love is just another asset to be exploited. The people who produce it do so with love and care, but it’s our devotion to the brand that makes it an inexhaustible resource to be consumed forever by a class of corporate Doomsday Machines.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>No one is a hero for not watching a television show, nor are they a villain for continuing to watch.</blockquote><p>Star Trek has given me a sense of purpose towards a better future, and a strong sense of responsibility towards myself. I cannot take back the countless hours or dollars I have invested in Star Trek for the past thirty-six years of my life. I have, however, seen a bountiful return on that investment. So much of what I love about myself has been instilled or nurtured in me by these characters, their stories, and their storytellers. Chief among these qualities — tolerance and curiosity, the kind of values that compel me to resist the impulse to reject the unfamiliar.</p><p>My first tattoo, which I had inked shortly after Donald Trump’s first election in 2016, is of the Vulcan symbol for IDIC — Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. It’s a shorthand for a philosophy codified by Leonard Nimoy’s Spock in the 1968 episode “Is There In Truth No Beauty?” that’s come to define Star Trek as a whole, one that celebrates the differences between people and cultures. I got this tattoo to remind me, when I’m an old man who’s alarmed by the amount of change around me, not to rally around whatever figure rises to validate my worldview at the expense of someone else’s. Instead of reflexively shunning new ideas and the people who believe in them, I will try to remember that the world is more beautiful because it’s not all about me, or like me, or for me. That’s the return I’m walking away with.</p><p>No one is a hero for not watching a television show, nor are they a villain for continuing to watch. Certainly, the large majority of creative professionals who are directly responsible for the brand have nothing to do with Skydance’s politics and lack the leverage to do anything about them. But in the years ahead, as more and more of what makes us who we are is gobbled up by fewer and fewer ghoulish robber barons, we’re all going to have to decide how much of ourselves we’re willing to keep renting from people who hurt us. We’re all going to make moral compromises, we’re all going to be subject to whataboutism, and we’re all going to make hypocrites of ourselves here and there. But sometimes, it will be shockingly easy. One to beam out.</p>

<p>The Mario-themed park will be getting a celebratory birthday makeover from <strong>18th March</strong>, featuring a giant superstar cake at the entrance and a special 'Star Hunt' activity within. Yoshi will also be joining the meet-and-greet circuit in the park itself, marking the first time that the beloved dino has been available for photo ops with the public.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The <a href="https://www.usj.co.jp/web/ja/jp/areas/super-nintendo-world">Universal Studios Japan website</a> also notes that the park will be stocking exclusive birthday food and merch options throughout the celebrations, because nothing screams 'happy birthday!' quite like consumerism.</p>
<p>The anniversary extras will be sticking around until 11th January 2027, so if you happen to be heading to Japan in the next year, you'll <em>have</em> to make a point to swing by.</p>

<p>Back in 2024, the park opened its first expansion in the shape of the Donkey Kong Country zone. Despite other parks popping up in the US in the five years since the Japan one started it all, it remains the only place that you can meet DK... not that we're at all envious, of course.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>1407274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>2024's <strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong> was one of the best games to release that year, despite it being a <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/">VR Meta Quest 3 exclusive and not arriving until December</a>. A sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">accidentally confirmed by one of its voice actors, <strong>Mark Rolston</strong></a>, who was set to play Commissioner Gordon in the coming sequel. But a new report from <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-canceled-as-camouflaj-sees-significant-layoffs/">UploadVR</a> reveals that <strong>Meta's</strong> recent 10% layoff to its Reality Labs division hit developer <strong>Camouflaj</strong> with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs, cancelling the sequel, and <strong>marking the end of Camouflaj developing VR games entirely</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong>Sanzaru Games</strong> were both shuttered by Meta</a> as part of the recent layoffs, which saw <strong>1,000</strong> people get laid off across the Reality Labs branch of Meta. While Camouflaj was one of the few that didn't get entirely shut down, according to the report, the studio "<em>has seen significant layoffs, and will no longer be developing VR games</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that Sanzaru Games was working on the Arkham Shadow sequel alongside Camouflaj, though that work ended once Sanzaru was shuttered, which also contributed to the sequel project getting cancelled. </p>



<p>With the teams behind two of the best VR games to release in recent years either shut down or pushed out of making VR games entirely, it's a clear sign from Meta that it is no longer invested in making VR games. It's also a sign of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones">Meta stepping away from its Metaverse focus</a> and instead investing in AI.</p>



<p>VR hasn't grown to be the next frontier of gaming in the way that many touted it would for years, as it remains a niche part of tech and the gaming industry, but it's still upsetting to see the teams that were making genuine strides in pushing the medium forward have been pushed out of it. Sanzaru Games' Asgard's Wrath 2 was regarded as one of the best VR games ever made when it arrived in 2023. Arkham Shadow was a new step forward for what combat could look like in VR.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this isn't the end for Camouflaj entirely, and we still see them move on to make their own games, rather than becoming a support studio for the few remaining teams under Meta's Reality Labs division still making VR games.</p>

            <p>
Alas and alack for Lickity Split, knight hero of The Fortress, prisoner of a villainous Sorceror King. ‘Twas I who named him (I wanted a pun on “Lich” and I’m fairly sure we’ve done “Lich My Balls” several times before) and ‘twas I who led him to his death a whole six rooms away from his cell... and ‘twas I who then resurrected him as a wizard and got him killed again, a mere five minutes later. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s not my fault, though. Lickity Split appears to have terrible luck, if not an actual Luck stat, and The Fortress is a dungeon crawler with a murderous fixation on dice. As regards the opening stretch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459150/The_Fortress/">the Steam demo</a>, at least, each fight sees you rolling dice of three different colours, then spending their pips to attack enemies with health points of the same colour. If the colours don’t match up, you’ll have to end the turn and take damage. 
</p>
<p>
The get-out clause is that any unused dice fill up a Super Mega Ultra AOE Attack gauge when you end the turn. This dishes out punishment without regard for niceties of coloration. That’s not much consolation if you get hacked to death before the gauge fills completely, though. Woe unto Lickity Split! I thought he was doing pretty well until he ran into that ghost dog.
</p>
<p>
There are nine character classes in The Fortress, each of which favours a different dice hue, or combination of hues. There are also three slots for equipment pieces that modify the dice, or confer shorter-lived benefits. A rusty shield will cancel one incoming attack before disintegrating; an enchanted scroll will add a pip to your blue magic die. There are also potential allies, or at least beings who are not initially enemies: “vampire merchants, fallen abbots, and other sinister figures, each hiding secrets and ulterior motives”.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Somewhere in the citadel above lurks your jailor. After dying twice to a ghost dog in room 6, I do not want to know how many different shapes and colours of dice it takes to kill the Sorceror King. Perhaps I can persuade him to play checkers instead.
</p><p>
I flailingly compared The Fortress to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legend-of-grimrock">Legend of Grimrock</a> and Eye Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beholder">Beholder</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-hytale-quarantine-zone-a-weird-batman-sim-and-a-fresh-batch-of-rpgs-and-shooters">this week’s Maw</a>, but it seems a lot simpler so far – a steady, linear onslaught of fights with the occasional treasure room, and precious little to distract you from the throwing of the bones. The retro presentation is lovely: heaving, gaping, pixelated enemies and walls of bruised and abraded shadow. I’d say it’s worth a pop at the demo, at least, if you like the screens. The full game launches on Steam tomorrow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The next Life is Strange game will launch this year and be fully revealed next week, publisher Square Enix has confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An official announcement of the project, widely expected to be titled Life is Strange: Reunion and feature the return of fan-favorite character Chloe, will take place next Tuesday, January 20 at 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern, or 6pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2eHeCKYHJc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> stream link is already available for the announcement, which is accompanied by the description: "Separate the real from the rumor... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/screenshot-2026-01-15-164656-1768495661681.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Life is Strange has teased the return of Chloe Price.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On Facebook, a brief teaser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2eHeCKYHJc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> shows what looks two characters walking by, their faces largely obscured. The second figure then turns their back fully to the camera, showing what looks to be a crow embroidered onto the back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, fans suspect these are the Life is Strange franchise's original duo Max Caulfield and Chloe Price. Caulfield returned after a long hiatus as the protagonist of the franchise's previous game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which received a mixed reception from fans for its treatment of the pair's relationship. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Max's return in a subsequent sequel was promised at the end of Double Exposure, so it would be no surprise to see her back again here. Exactly how this new game handles Chloe (and explains her presence, depending on players' past choices) remains to be seen, however. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-life-is-strange-game-spotted-and-yes-this-one-will-finally-bring-back-chloe">last week's early spilling of the game's likely title and plot</a> via the European ratings board, and a string of disgruntled leaks from developers pointing to a troubled development for the franchise behind the scenes, Square Enix's suggestion that fans should tune in to "separate the real from the rumor" feels like an acknowledgement of the series' current situation — but also, hopefully, that it has something promising for fans to move the franchise forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The retailer has quite a few discounts worth checking out right now, including a particularly solid deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of Best Buy’s Winter Sale, Ninja Gaiden 4 has dropped to $39.99 for both <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8NvZ?object_uuid=154d7934-05b6-4394-b879-28398def16bb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1JYn?object_uuid=154d7934-05b6-4394-b879-28398def16bb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>.

Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review">review</a> from IGN’s Mitchell Saltzman said, “Despite its disappointing story and bland level design, Ninja Gaiden 4's excellent combat still make it one of the best 3D action games in recent memory.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It even earned a runner-up nomination for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-game-of-2025">Best Action Game of 2025</a>, as it’s a “pure action fan’s action game, featuring some of the best melee combat we've seen in years, bolstered by aggressive enemy AI, excellent weapon design, and the ability to let your creativity run wild by giving you the freedom to hotswap between all of your weapons on the fly.” If that’s sold you, why wait to grab it? No better time than when it’s $30 off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, January has seen quite a few video game deals catch our eye alongside this one. Also in Best Buy’s Winter Sale that’s worth a look is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-miss-out-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds-down-to-45-as-part-of-best-buys-winter-sale">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, which has dropped to $45</a>, but that’s not all. Our breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-winter-sale-video-game-deals-january-2026">Best Buy’s Winter Sale</a> highlights even more gaming goodies worth grabbing while they’re still discounted.
