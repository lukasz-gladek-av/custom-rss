            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rumors have swirled for weeks now that the next <em>Fortnite</em> season would be a mini-season themed around Fox’s long-running animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em> Now we have new info from reliable leakers that claims the popular battle royale’s next big update will replace the game’s map with a virtual Springfield from the show.</p> <p>In September, reliable <em>Fortnite</em> insiders like HypeX and Shiina began reporting that the next season of Fortnite would be a <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season. Then, earlier this month, dataminers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706">discovered Kang and Kodos inside <em>Fortnite’s</em> files</a>. The two characters mention not being included in the battle pass, seemingly confirming that the rumors of a Simpsons-themed mini-season, complete with a battle pass, were true. Now those same insiders are reporting that the mini-season will replace Fortnite’s current battle royale map with a Springfield-inspired battlefield.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SIMPSONS x FORTNITE MAP IS FULLY SPRINGFIELD</p> <p>Also a Nuclear Plant POI — VIA <a href="https://twitter.com/NotPaloleaks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NotPaloleaks</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpushFNBR</a> <a href="https://t.co/s6H40GbEyK">pic.twitter.com/s6H40GbEyK</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1979986181413622240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On October 19, multiple <em>Fortnite</em> leakers, including Hypex, <span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks">NotPaloleaks</a>, and </span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR">SpushFNBR,</a> began reporting that the mini-season’s map will arrive in November and will be “fully Springfield.” Previously, some had theorized that part of Springfield would be added to the current battle royale map, but it sounds like that’s not the case. Instead, it’s claimed that the entire <em>Fortnite</em> map will be replaced with Springfield for the reportedly month-long event. <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Battle">That’s similar to how past mini-seasons have worked</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks/status/1980303035936165911">Paloleaks further reported that the map will be cel-shaded</a>, matching the look of the animated series. It’s also claimed that the new <em>Simpsons</em> season will include mash-up skins, likely mixing and matching <em>Simpsons</em> characters with <em>Fortnite</em> characters. I can’t wait to see what Epic does with Peely. Perhaps a Moleman x Peely skin that will make everyone question their sanity?&nbsp;</span></p> <p>As a giant <em>Simpsons</em> fan, I’m both excited about this <em>Fortnite</em> news and scared that I’m going to end up spending far too much money on a bunch of silly digital skins. <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">Yes, I know, I’m part of the problem and I’m sorry</a>. Epic hasn’t confirmed the new <em>Simpsons</em> season yet, and likely won’t until we get closer to November. Until then, I’ll just rewatch Treehouse of Horror episodes and mourn the loss of <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Simpsons Tapped Out,</em> the last new Simpsons game released in over a decade</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When The Outer Worlds launched back in 2019, it features humorous but often sharp writing highlighting the pitfalls of capitalistic ideals and the way markets interact with leaders in power. The Outer Worlds 2 promises even more of that, with a new governing trio fighting for control of the colony of Arcadia, and your Earth Directorate hero somehow in the center of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>With The Outer Worlds 2 launching on October 29 (or as early as Thursday if you buy the more expensive Premium Edition), we spoke to developer Obsidian Entertainment to learn more about how the team tackled its second bout with space-faring capitalism and whether or not real life plays a role in how it crafts its messages.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Unfortunately, those things haven't fixed [themselves]. I'm shocked," creative director Leonard Boyarsky sarcastically tells <em>Game Informer </em>when asked about capitalism's role in The Outer Worlds 2. "These are kind of unfortunately timeless themes that we have to deal with, and we kind of always deal with it in our games. We've always been involved in themes of power and balance, and it has to do with people having power and what they're going to do with that power, and it's generally not good for the people who don't have power, whether it's the Protectorate, who is full authoritarian and makes no bones about being a complete dictatorship [or] it's Auntie's Choice, which is trying to find this better way of spinning things so you feel like you're working for yourself [...] but you're still basically just helping them out."</p><p>When asked whether The Outer Worlds 2 reflects changes in capitalistic thought in the six years since the launch of the first game, Boyarsky says Obsidian doesn't try to be that timely. "These are universal themes, and if we time it too close to something going on in the world at a specific time, it gets very dated quickly," he adds. "And again, unfortunately, the bigger themes don't seem to change all that much from recorded history to now. People who have power tend to abuse the people who don't."&nbsp;</p><p>Though Obsidian says the real-world acquisition it went through – joining Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios – had no effect on the messaging within The Outer Worlds 2, curiously, Moon Man-fronted Spacer's Choice and Auntie Cleo's have merged in this sequel to create Auntie's Choice. This new organization represents the merchants of the game's trio of power, which consists of the aforementioned Auntie's Choice, the monarchy (Protectorate), and the church (Order of the Ascendant).&nbsp;</p><p>Boyarsky says the idea of this merger actually happened relatively early in the sequel's development. Two narrative designers who worked on the first game &nbsp;– Boyarsky notes they aren't "at the company anymore unfortunately" – came up with the idea of merging Spacer's Choice and Auntie Cleo's.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was the natural way to go," he says. "To put them together, it made the most sense. They were the ones out of everybody in all of the corporations in the colony; they were the ones who seemed to have the most presence. Putting them together was a no-brainer."&nbsp;</p><p>He and game director Brandon Adler tease that players will have to see how Auntie's Choice handles its role in this trio of power in The Outer Worlds 2 when it launches this month.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).

			<p>Following the launch of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally handhelds, not to mention the rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft's own handheld projects are dead in the water</a>, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Variety</a> that the company is absolutely still looking at making new hardware in the future: </p>



<p><em>We are 100% looking at making things in the future. We have our next-gen hardware in development. We’ve been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership we’ve announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, we’re going to build it.</em></p>



<p>Specifically with regards to the Xbox/Windows handheld experience, Bond said Microsoft is already looking at many software improvements:</p>



<p><em>There’s a ton more innovation to come, including things like further optimizing the experience here, scaling out the handheld compatibility program, offering more benefits and improvements to the experience and other features and adds that we’re going to give to people and more choices and more games.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally X got a 7.5 out of 10 score. Reviewer David Carcasole pointed the high price and lack of support for actual Xbox games as negatives:</p>



<p><em>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful, capable, and comfortable PC handheld device, with a smooth user experience thanks to the new Xbox UI. It's really like taking your computer on the go, with all of your PC games in your hands. For its mix of improved hardware, user experience, and battery efficiency, it's arguably the best PC handheld device to buy on the market. It's not an entirely smooth experience though, with plenty of PC gaming hiccups interrupting the 'console-like' experience the device is supposed to provide, the fact that it actually doesn't let you play all your Xbox games, and what I still believe to be an exorbitant price tag, when cheaper devices can provide comparable experiences.</em></p>

            <p>
Though I deeply wish for it to not be the case, unfortunately the reality you and I find ourselves in is one where AI is being forced into every single crevice the worst corporations you know can fit it in to. It hasn't completely dominated any of the arts just yet, but its usage is becoming more and more common. If you're one such developer considering doing so, voluntarily, I would normally offer you some potentially unkind words, but instead I'll point you towards the one and only Nobuo Uematsu, whose stance on AI is one I'm quite fond of.
</p>
<p>
The iconic Final Fantasy composer recently spoke to <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html">JARSAC Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-says-hes-never-used-generative-ai-and-never-will-hardship-is-what-makes-the-creative-process-rewarding/">Automaton</a>), talking about his time in the games industry, and notably how he feels about AI. "I’ve never used AI and probably never will," Uematsu explained. "I think it still feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself. When you listen to music, the fun is also in discovering the background of the person who created it, right? AI does not have that kind of background though. 
</p>
<p>
"Even when it comes to live performances, music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections."
</p>
<p>
This, my friends, is the only reasonable response to AI. There really is an inherent value in the process of making something, it lets you discover something unexpected in the thing you're making that putting in a short prompt could never let you experience. Have a bad time making things once in a while! This is Uematsu we're talking about here, he knows a thing or two about this art thing.
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that the composer announced last year that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasys-legendary-composer-nobuo-uematsu-doesnt-have-the-strength-to-score-a-full-video-game-again">likely won't be producing a full video game score again</a>, even if he does plan to keep making music in general (including writing the Final Fantasy games' main themes). I bring this up as he specifically mentioned not having the physical or mental strength to do so anymore. Accessibility is often touted as a reason why AI is good, but even here Uematsu shows that it's still possible to make things even when there are limitations to what and how much you can produce.

              <p>A demo for a free <a href="https://kotaku.com/impressive-simpsons-hit-run-remake-was-made-by-one-f-1847530115"><em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> mod that turns the beloved game into a <em>Futurama</em> adventure is finally here, around four years after the project was first revealed.</p> <p><em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is a still-in-development total conversion mod of 2003’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run">Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a>,</em> a fan-favorite semi-open-world game based on the long-running animated TV show and featuring most of the original voice cast and writers. <em>Hit &amp; Run</em> is one of those PS2-era games that has a large fanbase of older fans who desperately want a sequel. But what’s even better than a sequel? A whole new game based on a different animated comedy created by Matt Groening.</p>  <p>On October 19, Slurm Team (a collection of fan modders and devs) released the <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">first playable demo for<em> Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em></a><em>.</em> The free demo features the mod’s first level and is a small slice of the planned full project, <a href="https://youtu.be/5vhFwQmTD5c">which was first announced back in 2021</a>. Still, what is here is impressive and could easily be mistaken for a game that was released back on the PS2 in the early 00s. It should be noted that the devs behind the mod confirm that the demo contains AI-generated voices, but those will be replaced with real voice actor performances in the full release.&nbsp; Honestly, calling this a mod doesn’t feel accurate, as <em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is more like a new game built using the engine and tech of the OG <em>Simpsons</em> version. Here’s some gameplay of the demo:</p>

  <p>Considering how few <em>Futurama</em> games we got back in the day, and how we’re currently in the middle of a <em>Simpsons</em> video game drought (with <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Tapped Ou</em>t being shut down</a> in 2024), projects like this are the closest things fans of either animated show can hope for in 2025. Well, besides <em>Fortnite</em> skins and events, like a rumored <em>Simpsons</em> event coming to Epic’s battle royale juggernaut later this year. That might be fun, but I’ll still be over here longing for a new<em> Hit &amp; Run</em> starring Homer and the family. <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958">There were plans to make a sequel back in the day, but it never happened.</a></p> <p>Until then, I can play this new&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Futurama</i>&nbsp;mod using&nbsp;<a href="https://donutteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://donutteam.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Donut Team’s fan-developed modern PC port of Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a><i data-stringify-type="italic">,</i>&nbsp;available here. Note that you’ll also need an official copy of the original game to play the port and this new&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Futurama</i>&nbsp;mod.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for 2019's The Outer Worlds.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With The Outer Worlds 2 imminently about to drop, we think it's a good time to brush up on the fundamentals of Obsidian's high-concept sci-ifi universe and recount the events of the first game. The next 2,000 words or so will work nicely as a refresher for people who finished The Outer Worlds ages ago, and also as a primer for those of you diving into the sequel without any prior knowledge. It goes without saying, then, that what follows contains <strong>spoilers </strong>for The Outer Worlds 1. If you don't want anything spoiled... well, the long and short of it is that unregulated capitalism is bad. That's enough to get you going with The Outer Worlds 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you didn't come here for tl;dr. You clicked on an article to read it, so here's everything that happened in The Outer Worlds. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-parvati-1760711875065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Divergence</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds' story arguably starts in 1901 with a non-event. That is, President William McKinley not getting assassinated by an anarchist for failing to regulate the corporations, and subsequently, uh, leaving the corporations unregulated for the rest of his term and apparently for the rest of time, putting humanity on course to colonise the stars, but as an entrenched, hyper-capitalist society in which workers rights are not remotely a concept. So this is like a nightmare version of Star Trek where everything sucks unless you’re absurdly rich. Thank god this is just fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward a few hundred years, and The Earth Directorate, a one-world government established after a devastating war, is granting licenses to various conglomerates to go off and colonise distant planets, the titular Outer Worlds. We don’t know exactly how many galaxies have been colonised, but multiple systems are mentioned through the course of the game, including Septerra, Tyrannus, Draconis, and from the upcoming Outer Worlds 2, Arcadia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 isn't a direct sequel to its predecessor, so that's <em>technically </em>everything you need to know. But there's every chance that some<em>one</em> or some<em>thing</em> from the original game will make an appearance, be that as a side character, easter egg, or even an important event in the story. So read on to brush up on everything that happens prior to your adventure in game two. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lost Hope</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Our story occurs in the troubled system of Halcyon, and that trouble starts before the colonisation effort even reaches the system. Of the two vast colony ships sent there, only one arrives on time - The Groundbreaker. After seeding all the inhabitable planets with colonists, it becomes an independent freeport space station and floating strip mall, an essential hub for trade at the intersection between small time private enterprise and the rest of the corporation-controlled system. The second ship, the Hope, carrying tens of thousands of scientists and thinkers in suspended animation, has a skip drive malfunction enroute from Earth and ends up limping to Halcyon at sublight speeds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presumed lost, it is then discovered by The Board, Halcyon’s corporate overlords, and instead of being allowed to complete its journey, it is tethered to a remote ice moon and hidden from view. The Board don’t have the tech or the will to revive the Hope colonists, and they don’t want to have to deal with a public outcry about it, either. And so they are content to let it remain frozen and forgotten in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, however, irks one of their scientists, one Phineas Welles, who is so incensed by The Board’s inaction that he takes matters into his own hands and starts experimenting, in secret, on the Hope’s colonists in order to find a viable method of resurrecting them after all this time. He succeeds, but not before becoming a disgraced outlaw and the most wanted man in the entire system.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-phinneas-welles-1760711674865.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the resurrection process requires lots of rare material that’s difficult to gather when you’re on the run, and so Phineas decides to use his one and only test batch of revival serum on a single Hope colonist. In a last-ditch raid on the abandoned starship, he selects someone to revive at random in the hopes that they will become a loyal ally and help him finish his grand scheme: to revive every Hope colonist, seed the Halcyon system with smart people who aren’t idiots, and free the colonies from corporate control. He successfully does so, but not without his own ship sustaining significant damage, grounding it permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who he revives depends on <em>you</em>, the player, and their skills and character traits depend on your choices in both the character creator and the game’s narrative. And so begins a grand choice and consequence story in which the optimum outcomes are locked behind gates of competency – that is, if this heroic Stranger wants to achieve the most free and least bloody outcome for the people of Halcyon, they’re gonna need to pass some lofty speech checks. And we’re assuming that’s what they did, because covering every possible permutation of The Outer Worlds' story would take far more time than any of us reasonably has.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Unplanned Variable</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the player character arrives – almost forty years late – to the Halcyon system, The Board is content to preside over a system of shocking inequality, maintaining control through stifling bureaucracy and manufactured scarcity. But not every worker is a mindless drone, as we find out in Emerald Vale: the first major test of The Stranger’s resourcefulness, charisma, and political savvy - an opening chapter that sets the blueprint for all the conflicts to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, The Stranger needs a ride, and a guide. Welles arranges with a known privateer and general Han Solo archetype, Captain Hawthorn, to meet The Stranger on the planet Terra 2. Unfortunately what Hawthorn actually meets is the Stranger's drop pod, violently, with the top of his head. This leads The Stranger to commandeer Hawthorn's now captainless ship, The Unreliable - a sort of chubby Millennium Falcon with a feisty onboard computer - and take off on a grand interplanetary adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uh, except, not yet: it turns out that The Unreliable needs a replacement power regulator before it can go, which is annoying, but the pursuit of a new one does give The Stranger an opportunity to recruit two immensely useful companions: engineer Parvati and philosophical space-priest Vicar Max, both of whom provide boosts to The Stranger’s crucial Persuade and Intimidate skills, vital for the wheeling and dealing that lies ahead.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-emerald-vale-1760711576596.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After checking in with the boss of Emerald Vale’s biggest corporate town and Spacer’s Choice Saltuna cannery, Reed Tobson, it turns out that there are two power regulators in the area: one in his factory, which he is understandably reluctant to give up, and one at an abandoned Botanical Lab, now home to a set of deserters who, disillusioned with the systemic mistreatment they experienced as lifelong, sometimes multi-generational indentured employees of Spacer’s Choice, have decided to found a new cooperative society free from company oversight. Unfortunately, this means that the Saltuna Cannery is chronically understaffed, and so Reed asks you to cut off their power at the local plant in order to force his workers back into the fold, which will make it safe for you to nab their power regulator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a solid plan, but it does come with the downside of propping up an odious bootlicking toad like Reed at the expense of people whose only crime is wanting to be free of a system that is hostile to them. The obvious alternative is to screw him over and divert power to the Botanical Lab, but effectively killing the town of Edgewater at the same time – not only is Edgewater a safe walled city where people live, it is also the home of companion Parvati, so destroying it comes with a significant personal cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, however, an optimal solution: The Stranger decides to shut down the Botanical Labs and take its power regulator, initially making an enemy of the deserter leader Adelaide, but convinces Reed Tobson to step down as leader of Edgewater, cleverly using his own company loyalty against him by pointing out that he’s remarkably crap at his job, and that the best outcome for Spacer’s Choice is for him to just disappear. Morbid, sure, but they could have just shot him, so this really is the best outcome for all concerned. The Deserters return to the town, Adelaide takes over as administrator from Reed, and sets about making the colony more sustainable by growing food in soil enriched by, uh, corpses. Which is fine. Look, however you slice it, life is cheap here. There is, as it turns out, no perfect solution to any of Halcyon’s problems – but this way, the people of Edgewater get a little more health and happiness without having to give up the corporate infrastructure they so rely on.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Groundbreaker</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With a freshly installed power regulator and an eager new crew, The Stranger sets off to Groundbreaker Station, Halcyon’s premiere shopping destination and hive of scum and villainy. Most of it of the white collar variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There, they recruit two more companions: Felix, a canny dockworker with a high Persuade boost, and Ellie, a roving sawbones loyal only to her next pay packet who comes complete with a boost to the party’s lying skills.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-ellie-1760711774908.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stranger’s next task involves visiting the moon of Monarch, but this is tricky because the planet has been deemed off-limits by The Board as it is subject to an entrenched civil war and a communications blackout. Having been cut off from board oversight, it’s generally assumed that the place is bad news. Bad News, however, is The Stranger’s middle name. Or names. It’s not really. But look, nothing will deter The Stranger from going there, not even a corporate embargo or risk of certain death. They demonstrate this determination by doing a bunch of busywork in another semi-abandoned corporate settlement just to get enough bits to buy an illicit black market navkey to the town of Stellar Bay in the Cascadia region of Monarch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clearing the Air</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Phineas needs to procure a rare substance called Dimethyl Sulfoxide in large quantities to revive all the colonists still frozen on The Hope. To track some down, he’s made a deal with an information broker on Monarch with the help of Nyoka, The Unreliable’s final recruitable companion, but has yet to receive the intel for reasons unknown. So he sends The Stranger there in his stead to find and retrieve this vital piece of the puzzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon arriving on Monarch, The Stranger makes contact with Nyoka and sets off to Devil’s Peak, the ominous horned mountain that hosts a large communications station where the Information Broker is currently holed up, and learns (after doing lots of murder, like, loads and loads of it) that the reason Phineas hasn’t received the intel is that the region’s communications are being drowned out by pervasive broadcasts by Monarch Stellar Industries, the corporate remnant still holding onto power on Monarch, and The Iconoclasts, a group of anarchists determined to free the colony of Board control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is like the Edgewater vs Deserters situation on steroids, and confirms what Phineas has told you about Halcyon: the system is falling apart, and The Board are content to let it, rather than relinquish its stranglehold on the workers. But The Stranger is remarkably good at brokering impossible deals – getting people from opposing factions to see reason, and work together toward a common goal. They work this magic on Monarch, first to end the broadcasts and free up the comms tower to send Phineas his intel, and then – just as an encore, you understand – put an end to the conflict entirely with a little deposing here, a bit of finessing there. Turns out diplomacy's a piece of piss.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/tow-rizzos-1760712004193.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Byzantium</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorting out the mess on Monarch provided a strong foundation for the health of the Halcyon system going forward, but there still remained the issue of The Board and their sheer indifference to the horrific conditions that people are having to live with outside of their glittering capital city of Byzantium – which is exactly where the intel sends The Stranger in order to retrieve those vital chemicals, which are being used by The Board to run experiments on human test subjects in suspended animation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that The Board’s answer to the Halcyon system’s collapsing economy and total lack of food security is the Lifetime Employment Program – a scheme where all of Halcyon’s workers will be placed in indefinite suspended animation, revived only when needed, in order to reserve the colony’s dwindling food supplies for the societal elite in Byzantium. And, y’know, their scientists will totally get onto fixing the whole food shortage thing in the meantime. Definitely. Yep. Oh, and this involves killing everyone left on board The Hope to make space in the fridge for this planned batch of worker popsicles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This being unconscionable, The Stranger shuts down the board’s research and retrieves the Dimethyl Sulfoxide, the second to last piece of the puzzle needed to revive the Hope colonists. The final piece being the ship itself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Endgame</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Phineas sends The Stranger back to where it all started, the Hope, with a plan to restart its skip drive and bring it to Terra 2, so the work of reviving its colonists – said to be Halcyon’s best and brightest – can get underway. It is Phineas’s belief that they will be able to solve the colony’s food shortages and systemic conflicts with science, technology, and pragmatism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the ship is retrieved, though, it is discovered that Phineas’s secret lab has been ransacked, and he himself imprisoned on Tartarus, Halcyon’s infamous penal colony. The fight that ensues involves almost everyone The Stranger helped out on their travels up to that point – with both the MSI and the Iconoclasts showing up as allies to assist in this cosmic prison break, along with the crew of The Groundbreaker itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite a certain acceptable level of bloodshed being inevitable, The Stranger’s progressive reputation, history of even-handed pragmatism, and relative lack of a murderous streak puts them in a position to negotiate peacefully for Phineas’s release, locking in his vision for reviving the Hope colonists, and setting its brilliant thinkers on the path to fixing the colonies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halcyon system was not saved by violent action, but by negotiation, compromise, and calculated political manoeuvring. And also a bit of violence. A smidge. A necessary pinch of shooting and battering. Also petty theft and the odd swindle. But mostly the whole diplomacy thing. And via these actions, a ragtag group of colonists from all walks of life managed to deliver true, lasting systemic change to Halcyon before going their separate ways and their ship, The Unreliable, falling into legend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also at some point they lost contact with Earth and nobody knows what happened to it. I guess we’ll find out in The Outer Worlds 2 – a game on which, as far as we know, almost none of this has any bearing whatsoever. Still, saves you having to play it again, right?</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-story-recap]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Friends, you might not know it by scrolling through my author page here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but there were a few years where I was really disillusioned with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>. For a few generations, I played the games, but I wasn’t living and breathing Game Freak’s monster-catching RPGs like I am now and did as a kid. This wasn’t because the games weren’t resonating with me, but because I’d been kind of annoyed by the types of competitive-focused fans I suddenly found myself surrounded by in my high school years. All these years later, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has you encountering a group of similarly snobby, pretentious, gatekeeping </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>battlers, and putting the smack down on them was one of the most karmically satisfying moments in the game for me.</span></p> <p><span>As the kids around me grew up in my small Georgia hometown, it seemed like their relationship to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>changed. They stopped caring about who their favorite little guys were and started crunching numbers and making spreadsheets, suddenly becoming very concerned about the competitive viability of these monsters above all else. I tell a guy Beautifly is one of my favorite Pokémon and he starts preaching to me about how she’s a weak point in my team because she’s a frail bug. Bro, I don’t give a fuck, look how pretty she is. Eventually, the constant competitive-focused conversational detours those people insisted upon became so obnoxious, they pushed me out of the space. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>was always a social outlet for me, so to feel like I couldn’t really connect with other people through our mutual love of the world and its mysterious creatures soured me on it almost entirely.</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, I found my way back. The </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>game was the first step back in the door, as its mystery adventure mechanics and hopeful view of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe struck a chord with me in 2018. Then the movie came out, the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games and </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span> had me tethered to my Switch, and I could not have been more back. I watch competitive play at arm’s length, but I’m still hankering to go to the World Championships some day. By and large, though, I play these games for the worldbuilding, the story, and to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>hang out with Raichu</span></a><span>. Don’t tell me how to make my Pokémon better for a hypothetical tournament I’ll never compete in. I do not wish to know.</span></p>

  <p><span>I’m not the only one who feels this way, either, as evidenced by a group of kids in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> who call in Lumiose City’s mob equivalent to, with your help, get some competitive snobs to leave them alone. Lumiose City has a group called the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, which is led by the fairy-type trainer Jacinthe, a rich socialite who has a large amount of influence in the Paris-inspired metropolis. She is also, as you will come to find out, someone who insists upon herself, shows up uninvited, and puts literal barriers up to trap people into doing what she wants, and she seems to be involved in some kind of odd, fetishistic relationship in which she makes Lebanne dress up as a maid as some kind of humiliation ritual. That insistence seems to trickle down to the rest of the SBC members, as our first encounter with them is during a quest in which the player is running errands for the Rust Syndicate. A pair of these elites has started hounding a group of children, probably aged between five and eight, about how to make their Pokémon the Very Best Like No One Ever Was. Are you feeding your Pokémon the right supplements to ensure they’re competitively viable? If not, the SBC will come find you and pester you in broad daylight.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637287">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>So these poor kids call in for backup, and because I am indebted to the Rust Syndicate, that backup is me. The kids run up to me with distressed looks on their faces, and say they were just having battles on their own before the two people dressed way too well to be hanging out on a battle court started “lecturing” them about the importance of competitive viability. “I bet they’re just trying to show off to us because nobody their own age will put up with them,” one says. And despite all their insistence upon their own competitive superiority, my team wipes them out, and they go running off to their homebase with their Slowpoke tails between their legs. It was cathartic.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is such an expansive franchise that it can mean different things to different people. Some fans only engage with the games, others with the anime or card game, and some may just like having plushes on their desk. A series this big and broad is never just one thing to everybody, and trying to insist that it should be is the kind of toxicity that pushes people out. There will always be bad apples in the community that want everyone to conform to their vision of things, but at least I got to send my own personal </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>snobs packing.</span></p>

<figure data-uuid="b51b6ca716c9a"><a title="3DS Virtual Console" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b51b6ca716c9a/3ds-virtual-console.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time to talk trademarks again, as Nintendo of America has had a new filing for 'Virtual Console' bumped up to the pending phase. But let's be clear right from the jump, it <em>probably</em> doesn't mean what you're thinking.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT" tabindex="-1">@MikeOdysseyYT</a> on X, the <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=79425775&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademark</a> was initially submitted on 21st April 2025, and got boosted up to the pending phase last week on 17th October. The application pertains to two different goods and services classes: IC 009 for "Recorded electronic game programs; downloadable electronic game programs; recorded video game programs" and the like, and IC 041 for "Providing non-downloadable online electronic publications, namely online journals and interactive online blogs featuring user generated or specified content in the field of video games and online publications in the nature of e-books in the field of video games" amongst other things.</p>
<p>NOA currently has two other trademarks for Virtual Console (one renewed in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77975875&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2018</a> and one in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77014121&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2020</a>), each of which is only linked to one of the two 'Goods and Services' classes outlined above.</p>

<p>But does this mean that Virtual Console will be making a comeback? Probably not, honestly. Trademarking is a long-running game of protection, and Nintendo is <em>always</em> on top of it. The company issues renewals all the time, ensuring that its wording, names and IP all remain under the same legal umbrella — some of them turn into something, but most of them are just to keep everything on lock.</p>
<p>That said, this <em>isn't</em> a renewal. The application in question is for a new trademark, with the two pre-existing Virtual Console ones staying where they are. The fact that the newbie compiles the Goods and Services classes of the two others makes us think that this is just a pre-emptive way to move everything into one neat TM, but excited speculation is bound to lean in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Even putting the typical behaviour of trademarks to one side, we can't imagine that Nintendo would be considering bringing back the Virtual Console program while it continues to put Nintendo Switch Online front and centre. Sure, it would be lovely to get the chance to buy some of these classics on modern hardware, but why risk NSO subs in the process?</p>
<p>So yes, there may soon be a new trademark in town, but let's not get those hopes up, eh?</p>

			<p>EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile on January 20, 2026, with the game set to receive a final update today (October 20) followed by a series of limited-time events from now until just before the shutdown on January 20.</p>



<p>The Sims Mobile first launched on March 6, 2018, and by January 21, 2026, after seven years of updates and content that players paid for, the game will be rendered entirely unplayable. A post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/515222130291376715?l=english">official X (formerly Twitter) account announced the news</a> of the game's shutdown, but <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">a blog post on the official EA website</a> further dug into what this shutdown means.</p>



<p>Unlike previous examples of games being shut down where they will available to players who still have the game downloaded and on their device, not only will The Sims Mobile be unavailable for players to redownload from their library after January 20, it won't be playable for those who have it downloaded. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey Simmers,</p><p>We have some sad news today. After seven years and more than 50 updates, The Sims Mobile is releasing its final update. From January 20, 2026, at 1:59 PM UTC, TSM will no longer be accessible to play and will be sunset.</p><p>From today, all in-app purchases have been… <a href="https://t.co/quUA1UcPzF">pic.twitter.com/quUA1UcPzF</a></p></div>— The Sims Mobile (@TheSimsMobile) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSimsMobile/status/1980122238981665180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The game's servers are shutting down as of 1:59pm UTC, making the game entirely unplayable and players saved data inaccessible. The game will be delisted from digital stores tomorrow, October 21, and as of today, players can no longer make in-game purchases for The Sims Mobile. On January 6, 2026, the entire content library for the game will be unlocked for players, giving anyone still around free reign with all of the game's content for two weeks, before it disappears forever.</p>



<p>There's no explanation or even a suggestion as to why The Sims Mobile is shutting down after seven years. The blog post concludes with the development team writing, "<em>On behalf of the entir</em><em>e Sims Mobile</em> team, thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us. We hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims."</p>



<p>What might be a reason for its departure, however, is the coming of a new Sims mobile game to take its place. Last year, per a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/ea-only-plans-to-make-concentrated-bets-in-mobile-following-a-flurry-of-cancellations/">MobileGamer.Biz</a>, EA briefly spoke about a new Sims mobile game in the works codenamed "<em>Project Stories</em>." A release window was not shared, but it could be the case that we'll see a full reveal for this new title in 2026, hence the shutdown of The Sims Mobile at the start of next year.</p>



<p>Or, it could also be that this is the first of what could be multiple project shutdowns as EA finds a way to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">pay the $20 billion in debt from its $55 billion buyout</a>, and in fact the aforementioned unrevealed Sims mobile game is also set to be cancelled, with development teams waiting to learn if they've been laid off or not.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-simpsons-hit-and-run-futurama-mod</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/theres-a-simpsons-hit-run-futurama-mod-and-you-can-play-a-demo-right-now.1329601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of modders calling itself Slurm Team has created a mod for the classic 2003 open-world game&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Futurama</em>, and you can check out a demo right now.</p>

<p>As spotted by the good folks at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-simpsons-hit-run-modders-have-made-their-own-futurama-total-conversion-with-future-and-ramas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>,&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s demo is available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">download now</a> from Mod Bakery, and it's got a pretty significant slice of the final mod for you to take a look at as well.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>requires you to have a copy of the original game on PC, and you'll also need the Lucas'&nbsp;<em>Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>Mod Launcher program, which, as the name suggests, allows you to launch mods for the game (as well as adding various other improvements).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=-t_qDKBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=qrOBjT7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>has a demo for you to check out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The demo comes complete with four story missions and a bonus mission, as well as a wager race and three street races by way of side activities. It's also got four costumes and six vehicles for you to drive.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to nine "gags" and one "secret gag", as well as 25 wasps that serve as the mod's collectibles.&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>even comes with a custom version of&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s map based on New New York, as well as custom music.</p>

<p>There is one caveat, though. Slurm Team says&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>comes with generative AI-based voice acting for now; the team already has "professional voice artists" lined up for the full mod release, but for now, you'll hear AI voices. If that's a deal-breaker, you may want to wait for the mod's full release.</p>




<p>This is probably the closest thing you're going to get to an actual&nbsp;<em>Futurama&nbsp;</em>video game in the near future (assuming you're not content with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skins</a>, that is), so if you're a fan of the futuristic animated comedy series, I'd recommend giving the mod a look.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims Mobile to Shut Down in January]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-mobile-shutdown-january</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-mobile-to-shut-down-in-january.1329598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down early next year, and that the update being made available today will serve as the game's final patch before shutdown.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>website, EA says the game's servers will be closing down on January 20th next year. Since this is an online-only game, that means you won't be able to play it anymore, and it doesn't sound like there will be any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a> either.</p>

<p><em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s final update will offer the chance to experience several seasonal events between now and January, including today's Eerie Autumn event, Season's Greetings in December, and the New Year's Dock and Roll treasure hunt towards the end of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=OhGJm3Rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=efPDojjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>isn't sticking around for much longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's update also marks the end of the ability to purchase in-game currency for real cash in&nbsp;<em>The Sims Online</em>. Any SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets you still have in the game can be used until the date of the game's shutdown.</p>

<p>Additionally, EA is awarding all players unlimited energy to "complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play", and on January 6th, all of&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s in-game content will unlock for all players, which EA says will help you to "experience everything&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>has to offer" before it disappears.</p>

<p>If you've already downloaded&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>but you've deleted it from your device, you can download and play it again until January 20th, but after that date, both the game and any save data you might have will be deleted for good.</p>

<p>EA doesn't clarify a reason for&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>being delisted, but it's pretty easy to guess that the game isn't pulling the kind of player numbers the publisher wants in order to keep the experience alive.</p>

The game will be delisted from those storefronts tomorrow, so you've got until then to download it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New MindsEye Report Alleges "No Coherent Direction" and Heavy Crunch During Development]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-failure-new-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mindseye-report-alleges-no-coherent-direction-and-heavy-crunch-during-development.1329595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which may shed some light on why ill-fated third-person shooter&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>flopped so disastrously when it launched earlier this year, and the reasons are probably going to sound pretty familiar to you.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> for the BBC, reporter Tom Richardson spoke to former staff who worked for developer Build a Rocket Boy (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">underwent a hefty round of layoffs</a> earlier this year following&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s release).</p>

<p>An ex-developer known as "Jamie" (which isn't their real name) told Richardson that <i>Everywhere</i>, the user-generated content sandbox which was BARB's initial focus, was "quite special", but that once the studio's focus shifted to&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, boss Leslie Benzies "never decided what game he wanted to make".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=CVb_3x0x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=uUDg0txO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A former Build a Rocket Boy developer described sandbox project&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>as "quite special".</figcaption></figure><p>Jamie says there was "no coherent direction" on&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s development, and that Benzies would routinely request huge changes to features or missions in the game. Jamie says the team referred to these bug and feature requests as "Leslies", and that they "had to be taken care of" immediately.</p>

<p>Additionally, former staff at Build a Rocket Boy allege that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was developed under crunch conditions, with staff routinely working additional unpaid overtime hours during the week in order to finish the game.</p>

<p>Former employee Margherita Peloso, known as Marg, says they attempted to raise concerns regarding the state of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, but that they were "laughed at" by management. Marg says staff felt they were "commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return".</p>

<p>According to Richardson, ex-Build a Rocket Boy workers are "pessimistic" about whether&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>can be turned around, despite assurances from BARB that this is the studio's intention.</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to a decidedly negative reception from both players and critics alike (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye" rel="nofollow">ourselves very much included</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">game's launch</a> resulted in players requesting refunds over what they perceived to be unacceptable bugs and performance issues, as well as a sponsorship for streamer CohhCarnage being pulled at the last minute as reports of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s many problems poured in.</p>

<p><em>MindsEye</em>'s launch was so bad, in fact, that it appears to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">reconsider its entire relationship</a> with third-party publishing, although that didn't stop UKIE boss Nick Poole from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ukie-nick-poole-mindseye-scottish-gaming" rel="nofollow">seemingly citing the game</a> as an example of the strength of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why you'd want to, but if you're so inclined, you can check out&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mindseye/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mindseye/9PJ9WXK3V9FN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>One of the actors starring in the rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-zero">Resident Evil 0</a> Remake has seemingly been unearthed, via a codename listed on his resume. In case you're wondering who it is, he played various characters, possibly including a mine-dwelling cultist, in FarCry 5.</p>
<p>As a refresher, this is the Resident Evil 0 remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">Twitterer Dusk Golem claimed to be in development</a> alongside a Code Veronica remake last year. Those claims were corroborated by VGC. Dusk Golem's <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362">since asserted</a> that the "broad goal we're roughly looking at" for the two projects are early 2027 for Code Veronica and 2028 for Resi 0.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to today and the CV of Canadian actorman Jon McLaren. <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">MP1st</a> report that the codename for the Resi 0 remake is 'Chamber' and the <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren">version of McLaren's online resume</a> listed on casting profile site Actors Access cites him as having nabbed a lead role in an "upcoming AAA video game" with that same codename.</p>
<p>His work on Project Chamber's also listed as having taken place at <a href="https://www.beyond-capture.com/beyond-projects">Beyond Capture Studios</a>, a casting and capture studio who've previously worked on Capcom's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> and its Separate Ways add-on. It's hardly the only game they've worked on though, with credits on stuff ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a>.</p><p>So, who is this actorman? Well, he's previously provided the voice of Star Lord in Marvel's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, as well as the voices of "various" FarCry 5 characters. I decided to do a bit of digging into the latter, and found that his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_McLaren">Wikipedia</a> only lists him as having voiced the Ubisoft shooter's Catamount Mines Cultist. An attempt to put the matter to bed by scanning the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6967966/fullcredits/">credits on IMBD</a> has only yielded an error message, so I'm choosing to believe McLaren voiced every single living thing in Montana, including all of the animals.</p>
<p>Outside of that, McLaren earns maximum Canada points for having starred in a TV movie called '<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweet_as_maple_syrup">Sweet as Maple Syrup</a>' and lists "SAXOPHONE, DRIVERS LICENSE" among his special skills. Whether the latter means he has a special drivers' license which allows him to play the riff from Baker Street while motoring along at 70 miles an hour remains a mystery.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-870-evo-ssd-is-now-practically-free-storage-at-0-10-per-gb-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-month%E2%80%99s-end.1329580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your beloved older laptop’s biggest problem might not be that balky spacebar you’ve already replaced twice, or the big scratch on the lid. If it’s been sort of gasping and wheezing along, it could just be an issue of storage, or lack thereof. An overstuffed hard drive in a PC laptop or desktop is an unhappy hard drive, and an unhappy hard drive can bring everything to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>You could replace the whole thing, obviously, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/">you could give the old fella a new lease on life for as little as $55 by hitting Amazon for their deals on the Samsung 870 EVO 2.5-inch SSDs</a>, ranging in size from 500GB all the way up to a monstrous 4TB. It’s like a brain transplant, but far less expensive, and with no bonesaws needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Faster, Better</h2>
<p>We’ve established that replacing an older, smaller internal SSD with a Samsung 870 EVO doesn’t require a pile of money, but it also doesn’t require a mastery of IT skills. Once you back up your old drive to a reliable external storage device, swapping it out for the Samsung 870 EVO is a fast, easy procedure. Restore your files to the new drive, and the difference in performance will be immediately obvious. That’s due in part to the vastly superior speed of the 870 EVO — sequential speeds of up to 560/530 MB/s.</p>
<p>Unlike your old drive, the 870 EVO is up to the heaviest of tasks, including 8K video processing, and it’s built with durability and length of life in mind — the 4TB model is guaranteed by Samsung for up to 2,400 TBW (terabytes written). And, while it is absolutely recommended that you do a little research beforehand to ensure the Samsung 870 EVO is compatible with your laptop or desktop PC, it’s been compatibility-tested for a massive array of host systems and applications, including chipsets, motherboards, NAS, and video recording devices.</p>



<h2>Who Knew?</h2>
<p>Samsung has been renowned for so many high-quality tech products over the years, from TVs to smartphones, home appliances to tablets, laptops to wireless earbuds, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Samsung has also been the world’s leading brand for flash memory for over two decades, all the way back to 2003. Whether you’re opting for the 500GB model of the 870 EVO for just $55, going all the way up to the 4TB for $260, or somewhere in between, you’re getting an internal drive from the world’s leading brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/">The current Amazon deal is for the 500GB model of the Samsung 870 EVO — it’s 27% off right now, bringing its price down from $75 to $55</a>. The 1TB ($95), 2TB ($180), and 4TB ($260) models are currently listed at full price. But even if you’re looking to replace a 500GB hard drive, the Amazon deal for just $55 delivers a far faster, more advanced drive than your current one.</p>

<p>A reliable insider has revealed that the announcement for Starfield’s PS5 port will not arrive until 2026. </p>



<p>Starfield’s PS5 port is something players have been hearing about since the first lot Xbox titles made it over. We have already heard rumours about the space-adventure title releasing for PS5 in 2026, and now new rumours about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 port</a> have surfaced as well. However, it seems none of this will be officially announced this year. </p>



<h2 id="h-starfield-s-ps5-port-will-be-announced-in-2026">Starfield’s PS5 Port Will be Announced in 2026</h2>



<p>NateTheHate was recently asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), whether he had any new information to share about Starfield’s PS5 launch. The insider replied stating “believe the announcement will be in 2026 unless plans change.” The insider had previously confirmed that the game is indeed releasing for the PlayStation 5, and the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-its-once-again-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intent</a>” of releasing the port should be announced in 2025. However, now it seems that players won’t see an announcement until next year. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/">report</a> from another source had stated earlier this year that Starfield and it’s new expansion should release for PS5 by Spring 2026. Moreover, a Starfield port for PS5 has never been ruled out by Microsoft. When Phil Spencer was asked about this specific topic, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “here’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda teased Starfield ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post. Additionaly, the developers have mentioned the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next DLC three times</a>, but haven’t confirmed any details.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fallout: New Vegas celebrated its 15-year anniversary on October 19, 2025. Below, we take a fond look back at the flexibility and humor that helped define it as one of the best Fallout games, and an enduring classic RPG.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Fallout: New Vegas released back in 2010, there was an air of confusion. Fallout 3 had released in 2008 and Bethesda had successfully resurrected the somewhat-dormant series from a quirky isometric role-playing game to a first-person exploration game akin to its success with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. After a successful run of downloadable content, Bethesda Game Studios moved on to work on its next Elder Scrolls project. But like a deathclaw to radiation, the wasteland started calling players once again.</p><p dir="ltr">Enter Obsidian Entertainment, a studio formed from the ashes of Black Isle Entertainment. Filled with industry veterans who had a hand in creating acclaimed role-playing titles such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Baldur’s Gate, the prestigious studio was recruited by Bethesda parent company ZeniMax to craft a new experience in the post-nuclear wasteland separate from what Bethesda Game Studios had done with Fallout 3.</p><p dir="ltr">The result was Fallout: New Vegas, a wholly original experience that used Bethesda’s engine and framework from Fallout 3 but tapped into the quirkiness and deep role-playing elements that were found in the original two games. So while on the surface, many could mistake New Vegas for a glorified expansion of 3, under the hood was an RPG experience that was far deeper and more complex than anything presented in its predecessor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586938-ss_ac7dbb6b5d1353ec1e66110fe652883b957a70e3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586938-ss_ac7dbb6b5d1353ec1e66110fe652883b957a70e3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586938"></a><figcaption>Fallout: New Vegas</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586938-ss_ac7dbb6b5d1353ec1e66110fe652883b957a70e3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Fallout: New Vegas follows The Courier, a delivery person trudging through the Mojave wasteland of Eastern California, Northern Arizona, and Southern Nevada. When they get an order to deliver the mysterious Platinum Chip, they’re ambushed by Benny (played by the late Matthew Perry) and left for dead in a shallow grave. When they’re rescued and resuscitated by local townsfolk, they set out through the wasteland to figure out what happened to them.</p><p dir="ltr">While Bethesda’s take on open-world RPGs encourages exploration in any direction, Obsidian decided to curate the player’s experience. Unlike in Fallout 3 where the player’s story and memories were made out in a virtual field, New Vegas guides players along a set story path, peppering in vignettes where their actions and decisions will affect more than their personal outcomes. Sure, one could make a beeline straight for the bright lights of New Vegas, but they would miss the stories in the surrounding Mojave and be forced to face over-leveled enemies. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas isn’t afraid to get brutal and unforgiving with its RNG-based combat system, where every pull of the trigger is a roll of the dice. Every combat encounter was a fight for survival, though silver-tongued players could use the dialogue system to get out of sticky situations too.</p><p dir="ltr">This helps hammer home perhaps Fallout New Vegas’ most interesting quality: The Courier is not the main character. While The Lone Wanderer and their story to find their father was the main focus in Fallout 3, The Courier is but a small piece of the Mojave pie. The Mojave Wasteland is under siege from numerous factions such as the New California Republic, Caesar’s Legion, and Mr House: the leader of New Vegas himself. There are also numerous smaller factions such as the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel that have stories in the Mojave that the player can influence.</p><p dir="ltr">These major factions also were unique in their aesthetics and beliefs. The NCR believed in a governing system much like our modern "democratic" system featuring soldiers decked out in military fatigues and with a standard arsenal to match. The Legion dressed as ancient Romans and believed in the supremacy of their monarch Caesar, no matter how flawed he was. Mr. House well … Mr. House wanted full control of everyone, resulting in ultimate power. Players could choose which of these factions to help out or pit against each other, and there was never a right or wrong answer. Always murky shades of gray (or in New Vegas’ case, murky shades of brown). The faction system made players have a small but influential role in a larger world and governing system that helped decide the fate of the Mojave. Helping one faction would lower your standing with another and sometimes players would even need to wear disguises through certain territories if their standing was too low. The faction system has never quite returned in the series though Fallout 4 attempted to recreate the system to little success that was riddled with less complex choices and consequences.</p><p dir="ltr">That’s not to say New Vegas was all serious business as the game reintroduced a healthy amount of quirky humor evocative of early entries in the series, even dedicating a perk called “Wild Wasteland” that when chosen would introduce more humor events into its world. Whether it be an Indiana Jones reference with a fedora stored in a derelict refrigerator or the presence of a UFO, or a gang of grannies that rob you the moment you hit the strip, there was no shortage of humor in New Vegas’ world.</p><p dir="ltr">There has never been quite an entry in the Fallout series such as New Vegas. It was a melding of new ideas from Bethesda with the old philosophy of role-playing from the classic early entries. It wasn’t a game where the player was the hero but one where the player was an active participant, helping shape it with very small decisions made. New Vegas, even 15 years later remains influential today, inspiring countless RPGs from Bethesda’s own Fallout 4, to Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds, and you can even see influence from the faction system in games such as Star Wars: Outlaws. New Vegas is even inspiring television, as Amazon Prime’s Fallout series is set to have New Vegas as its central setting and even feature Mr. House as a major character. Fifteen years later, Fallout: New Vegas remains one of the most captivating role-playing experiences in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forming the perfect mix of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, puppies, and supporting a worthy cause, we got to sit down this week to discuss Puppy Roll 2, an upcoming charity livestream being hosted by Anjali Bhimani with special guests that fans of the actual play world will be more than familiar with.</p>

<p>"The Puppy Roll is a livestream charity that I started last year along with the good folks at Petco Love," Bhimani launched into an explanation of the event, "This charity is all about helping other animal shelters and adoption initiatives across the country."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//JcU7yj99uxY"></iframe></p>

<h2>Players And Their Pets</h2>

<p>"The conceit of the event itself is that you will see familiar faces from your screen, whether that be TV and film, or the TTRPG Actual Play spaces playing D&amp;D as our pets. It is delightful chaos, I will be the DM - the Doggie Master - and I can't wait to do it again.</p>

<p>The full cast of The Puppy Roll is as follows:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Anjali Bhimani &amp; Charley as The DM</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Matthew Mercer &amp; Omar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Aabria Iyengar &amp; Suvi</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashley Johnson &amp; Sully</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Maggie Robertson &amp; Cricket</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Jonathan Graziano &amp; MIlton</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ginny Di &amp; Pablo</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Emily Axford &amp; Bruce</li>
</ul><p>Hearing that Axford would be joining the table I did want to see how Bhimani was feeling knowing that who that AP scene has coined as a chaotic player would be at her table. "The thing that I find remarkable about her, and remarkable about so many players is that despite the fact that what we see as viewers is chaos there is also this virtuosic ability to understand that what the story might need at that moment"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-some-players.jpg?itok=6hmK62DO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-some-players.jpg?itok=ZCxs_vcr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bhimani complimented the ability that a lot of the players at this table have to funnel the chaos not to be disruptive but that it supports it. "I never feel like Emily is taking out DM in the wrong direction, it might surprise your DM and any time she can surprise Brennan Lee Mulligan I support it because that's one of the smartest men aline, I don't even know how you can surprise him."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They may seem like they're taking crazy choices, but they're choices that are supporting the story"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to the mention of cats in this year's title there are cats getting brought into the picture. Ginny Di and Emily Axford will be joining the table of dogs as their pet cats.</p>

<p>Focusing on the idea of the Puppy Roll starting as dogs, before expanding Bhimani spoke a bit about the relationship she had with her own dog Charley. "I had such an incredible relationship with our dog Charley, he was so much of who I am and many of the parts of myself that I like came from loving him and learning how to love him better."</p>

<p>"That connection that we have with animals, whether they're our animals or other people's animals, but there are so many relationships that are extraordinary between humans and animals"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They give us so much healing so with them giving us so much it means so much to be able to return that to them."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Em-BARK-ing On An Adventure</h2>

<p>The Puppy Roll is going to be a direct sequel to the original adventure, picking up with the same heroes as they continue to adventure. Talking more about the plotline Bhimani explained "We will be in the land of Doggo and some of the locations within Doggo, but we will also be exploring outside of Doggo." That's where Bhimani cut me off for fear of spoilers…</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-dm-anjali.jpg?itok=mLKfZ1e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-dm-anjali.jpg?itok=V86oFLka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To create an adventure of dogs means that the world also has to be filled with dogs. Discussing the ways roleplaying people and pooches differ Bhimani was able to shed some light on the situation "It's so much fun, the Puppy Roll last year was the second time I've DM'd and I think there's some freedom to 'I don't know what I don't know'." One thing that she did want to make clear was that these dogs aren't anthropomorphic dogs, but instead the pets as they are in real life.</p>

<p>Bhimani shared a fascinating anecdote about sitting on a plane shifting between writing her published adventure, The Malady of Minarrh, while also working off the different Dungeons &amp; Dragons source books to find what spells and magical items would fit into a world of puppy puns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I had two windows and one of them was like demon possession, and the other one was about puppy puns and I was like 'this is the extraordinary thing that is my life'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing to discuss the idea of translating your own pet into a D&amp;D character Bhimani was firm on the idea of creating characters that were accurate to the real life counterparts. "Cricket, the cleric, worships Maggie Robinson, that is her deity. What these players have been able to do is think 'if I'm still here what is it about my pet that makes them a particular class.'"</p>

<p>Honing in on one example she talked about Omar, Matthew Mercer and Marisha Ray's corgi. "He's such a perfect Paladin/Barbarian. He is so noble, he is such a protector, he also kinda has this crazy energy. When you see Matt playing it you totally will understand it."</p>

There are donation incentives and wars that will allow you to gift the players or DM ins-paw-ation or advantage.</p>

<p>For those who aren't able to catch the stream live there will be additional waves of giveaways and chances to donate too. Bhimani jokes that the only reason they even took down the tiltify for last year's Puppy Roll is because they wanted to put up the one from this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can check out The Puppy Roll II live on October 20, 2025, at 6 pm PST on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgOvCVQ5U3nNeoka-GroeQ" rel="nofollow">Anjali Bhimani's YouTube channel</a> where the VOD will stay available to watch at any time.

            <p>A number of former staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developers Build A Rocket Boy have offered some more details on alleged mismanagement at the company. They claim that director Leslie Benzies "never decided what game he wanted to make" during development of both dodgy action-adventure MindsEye and the umbrella game creation tool Everywhere. The former developers also paint a picture of disruptive micro-management, with issues Benzies spotted being named after him and forced to the top of the priority list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo">the BBC</a>, which follows 93 current and former staff at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-devs-accuse-studio-execs-of-disastrously-mishandling-redundancies-and-enforcing-unbearable-crunch">signing an open letter</a> accusing the studio's senior leadership of having "consistently mishandled the redundancy process" when laying off between 250 and 300 staff. The letter signees also claim BARB mandated "unbearable levels of overtime" around the game's launch.</p>
<p>These developers have also filed legal claims against the studio, with help from the Independent Workers of Great Britain union. Build a Rocket Boy have said they handled the redundancies "with care and transparency, meeting all our obligations", adding that they're "listening closely to feedback from former employees and are committed to learning and growing from it".</p>
<p>"Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make," said 'Jamie', an anonymous former Build a Rocket Boy developer who left the company in 2022. They described the studio's initial pitch for Everywhere - an online game creation tool organised around a city hub, which BARB have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/">shelved</a> while they work on fixing MindsEye - as "something quite special". The studio managed to pull in a lot of cash in those early days, accruing more than £233 million of investment by 2024, but were still posting losses.</p><p>Mismanagement was rife at BARB, former employees say, with former associate producer Margherita 'Marg' Peloso alleging their attempts to raise concerns about issues were "laughed off". Benzies in particular is singled out as having made things worse with his approach to highlighting problems in the game, with the devs citing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ztKumy2bpk">YouTube video</a> on Build a Rocket Boy's channel that shows the director playing the game while instructing folks to pen down issues with the likes of fire extinguishers and raindrops.</p>
<p>The ex-staff say these fix requests were known as "Leslie tickets", with Jamie saying they were also dubbed "Leslie bugs" or just "Leslies". The issue, they claim, is that such bugs or sometimes requests to scrap entire missions were all expected to be shunted straight to the front of the queue. "It didn't matter what else you were doing, what else was being worked on," said former lead data analyst Ben Newbon. "The Leslie ticket had to be taken care of."</p>
<p>Further in, Newbon cites the studio's quality assurance team as having been particularly badly affected by crunch in the run-up to MindsEye's release from mid-February to May.
