It quickly became the biggest hit of the year so far, turning into both a sales juggernaut and a cultural phenomenon. And in an era of hyper consolidation, it made Arrowhead Studios an obvious target for acquisition by the game’s publisher, Sony. Months later, co-founder Johan Pilestedt maintains the Sweden-based team of over 100 has no plans of becoming another cog in the first-party PlayStation machine. </p><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196406,192516" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p> “We pride ourselves on being an independent studio,” he told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new interview today</a></span>. “We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s massive May update--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-massive-may-update-is-finally-here-check-out-the-patch-notes/1100-6523488/">the biggest to hit the game</a> since its September 2023 launch--arrived last week, introducing tons of new quality-of-life features (like improved scanner function and surface maps) and long-awaited bug-fixes for some of the game's most important quests. The May update ostensibly has it all, from options to tweak combat difficulty to increased inventory space and even improved ship-decorating mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">As a fan of Bethesda's previous games (and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/" data-ref-id="1900-6418098">huge space nerd</a>), I was excited to get my hands on the update and take it for a spin. Disappointed by the state of the game at launch, I'd awaited this update with bated breath, hoping Starfield would finally get the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> treatment and rise like a phoenix from its buggy, underwhelming ashes. Unfortunately, upon firing up the game, I discovered something incredibly disheartening: Rather than drastically improving Starfield's gameplay, the May update instead makes the game's flaws even more evident and introduces new bugs. Later, I stumbled into an even more painful truth: Although the update itself is available free of charge, some of the update's best quality-of-life improvements come with a surprising price--one that players might not be willing to pay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306709"></a><figcaption>Players who take advantage of Starfield's new settings may be unhappy to learn that some quality-of-life improvements come at a surprising price.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Playing on Xbox, I fired up an old save and immediately proceeded to test out the new surface maps and scanner functions. Functionally, the new three-dimensional surface maps do a fantastic job of helping players get their bearings and allow them to survey a planet's topography without having to physically run around to see if there's anything worth finding on it. The new maps don't exactly scream, "Hey, there's a really cool point of interest over there!" but the 3D details that now appear on a planet's surface map mean players can spot buildings, unusual rock formations, and other details that may indicate the presence of an interesting locale they might wish to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 3D maps for major buildings, as well, which make getting from point A to point B significantly easier when exploring large enclosed areas with multiple floors. Prior to the update, players could only rely on a trail of arrows that would appear on the ground while using the scanner, pointing them in the direction of their current objective. Those guide arrows are still there, and still have a tendency to disappear at random, but players now have more options than simply putting the scanner away and taking it back out again to get them to reappear. The new update's 3D building maps make it much easier to figure out which floor certain destinations are located on, but appear to be available only for large or unique buildings, like the fully enclosed city of Cydonia on Mars. If a player finds themselves struggling to navigate oft-reused structures, like the Robotics Science Facility on Volii Chi, they'll still have to rely on the guide arrows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306704" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306704"></a><figcaption>Starfield's new surface maps make navigating easier, but also demonstrate how empty the galaxy feels, even on major planets like Mars.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The new 3D surface maps work well but also demonstrate exactly how empty many of the game's 1,000+ planets truly are. POIs are still extremely sparse on most planets (even those with large settlements, like Mars), and players are still going to find themselves running for several minutes straight--with nothing but rocks to look at on the way--to get from their landing zone to the undiscovered POIs on their maps. Even with a fully tricked-out Boost Pack and a dose of Amp (which temporarily increases movement speed by 35%), getting around in Starfield remains an exercise in frustration. Traveling from one POI to another on-foot still takes far too long, but on the bright side, Bethesda has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">announced that ground vehicles are finally in development</a>. In the meantime, Starfield's scanner has been updated with a useful new feature: When activated, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-biggest-update-since-launch-arrives-on-may-15/1100-6523100/">POIs now pop up on the scanner</a>, allowing players to select them and fast-travel instantly, without having to waste time navigating through multiple menus to do so.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's a downside. Naturally, players cannot fast-travel to undiscovered POIs until the player has unlocked them by first reaching the location on foot. But returning players will likely be displeased to discover that even POIs they've <em>already</em> discovered must be re-unlocked if they want to fast-travel there with the new scanner function. I've already explored every inch of New Atlantis, for example, and while I can still fast-travel to The Lodge and various other locations via the menus on the starmap, those locations are not unlocked for me on the scanner. This also means returning players will be repeatedly bombarded with "New Location Discovered" notifications when arriving at POIs they haven't visited since before the May update, and will obviously not be earning any XP for re-discovering these locations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306705"></a><figcaption>Returning players must re-unlock visited POIs to use the scanner's new fast-travel function.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg"></figure><p>Speaking of XP, one incredibly important detail Bethesda left out of its marketing for the May update is the fact that making use of certain new features can affect how much XP a player earns. One of the best features in the update is the ability for players to tweak things like the difficulty of ground combat vs. space combat from the game's settings menu. Players can even increase the amount of credits that vendors have on them (making repeated trips to sell off stolen goods a thing of the past) and tweak how much weight their character can carry. But there's a price: Increasing your character's carry weight will decrease the amount of XP you gain. Increasing the distance from which you can access items in your ship's cargo hold will have the same effect. Changing your character's carrying capacity from Normal to Increased will decrease the amount of XP you earn by 6%. Upping your carrying capacity to Greatly Increased will cost you 8% of your earned XP. Allowing yourself to access your ship's cargo hold from anywhere will knock off another 6%. Increasing vendor credits from Normal to Greatly Increased decreases your earned XP by a further 4%.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306706"></a><figcaption>The new settings are great, but the price players pay for using them is rather steep.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With my character's carrying capacity set to Increased, vendor credits set to Greatly Increased, and my ship's cargo accessible from anywhere, I was earning a total of 16% less XP per activity than I otherwise would. But even stranger than that, tweaking combat damage (in space or on the ground) has zero effect on the XP you earn. It seems odd that Bethesda is set on punishing players who want to avoid repeatedly fast-traveling back and forth to access their ship's cargo hold, making multiple trips to multiple Trade Authority locations to sell their goods, or listening to their companions repeatedly complain out loud that they're carrying too much because the game's woefully inadequate default carry capacity means they're constantly finding themselves overencumbered. Why give players the option to play the game their way and then punish them for it?</p><p dir="ltr">Players looking for a challenge will be rewarded, however, as decreasing vendor credits, ship cargo accessibility, and carry weight will increase the amount of XP players earn. But this makes the fact that there's absolutely zero XP penalty for increasing the damage one does in combat (or decreasing the damage enemies can do) even stranger. I tested this by running the "Eyewitness" quest with max player damage and minimal enemy damage--reducing the difficulty so severely came with no XP penalty but did make the battle laughably easy, reducing one of the game's most formidable monsters into a creature roughly as dangerous as a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radroach" rel="nofollow ">Radroach</a>. One wonders what Bethesda's goal is with regard to XP penalties and bonuses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306725"></a><figcaption>Many of Starfield's persistent bugs are harmless and hilarious, but others can prove quite frustrating.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the topic of Radroaches, replaying the Terrormorph questline also revealed that there's still quite a lot of work to be done in terms of squashing the game's many bugs. I encountered naked miners on Cydonia, saw my companions walk around without a spacesuit on planets with no atmosphere while brandishing invisible guns, and had an entire conversation with the back of an NPC's head (it seems the issue with the game's camera glitching out during dialogue sequences is still alive and well). After disposing of the comically feeble Terrormorphs that attacked New Atlantis, I turned around to discover that a vital NPC companion appeared to have been downed or killed in the fight. The option to speak with her was still appearing, but selecting it didn't wake her up, so I made my way back to the UC Vanguard soldiers who I'd left to hold the line behind me.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon striking up a conversation with the soldier who was meant to debrief me, the game entered a dialogue scene, but presented no dialogue options for me to choose from. Unable to exit the dialogue or access the game's menu, I was forced to restart, and upon doing so, discovered the automatic save created when I exited the game had been corrupted, renaming my character to "Dude Mack" and changing her level from 31 to "##." I went back to a previous save, made in the moments after I put down my last Terrormorph, and loaded in to find that the entirety of New Atlantis had become a game-breaking shade of yellow that made it almost impossible to see anything. After restarting the game once again, the save finally loaded correctly, and the mysteriously downed NPC was alive and well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306708"></a><figcaption>Bugs are still alive and well in some of Starfield's most prominent quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Starfield's May update is certainly a step in the right direction, and features like the ability to decorate one's ship in the same manner as an outpost or player home are fantastic. Updates to Photo Mode now allow players to choose from a variety of facial expressions for their character, and they can also change the pose and expression of whichever NPC the player has accompanying them, making photo ops more appealing. The 3D surface and building maps are extremely helpful, as is the new ability to fast-travel from the scanner. But ultimately, Starfield still suffers from the same issues that plagued it at launch, from frustrating bugs to empty planets with little of interest to discover. By far, the biggest issue with the new update is that some of its most useful features--like the ability to access ship cargo more easily, carry more items, and make fewer trips to Trade Authority vendors--come with a built-in punishment for players who dare to make use of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Bethesda hasn't shared when players can expect to gain access to ground vehicles for planetside exploration, their addition will hopefully improve the core experience of the game, and one hopes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">the Shattered Space expansion coming this fall</a> will also add a bit more depth to a game that currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/">feels a mile wide and an inch deep</a>. I'm still hopeful for the future of Starfield and am looking forward to the new expansion. But after experiencing the game's biggest update yet, I fear that Bethesda's decision to penalize players for making use of sorely needed quality-of-life improvements and persistent bugs in some of the Starfield's biggest quests will continue to negatively impact the game, and I find myself wondering if other features planned for the game might also come with a hidden price. Vehicles are all well and good, but not if I'll have to synthesize my own gasoline to use them, or suffer an XP penalty for daring to cram a few too many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-made-the-sandwich-from-the-starfield-trailer-and-you-can-too/1100-6493196/">space sandwiches</a> in the trunk when I embark on an interstellar picnic.</p>

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Semi-automatic weapons often get overlooked by their fully automatic counterparts, yet the M16A4 deserves plenty of attention. </p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">The M16A4 requires an abundance of skill and patience to perfect. Instead of firing and forgetting like other assault rifles, the M16A4’s three-round-burst firing type eliminates any margin for error and forces players to be accurate with their shots. When perfected, it will become second nature to take down enemies in two bursts, but in the beginning, there will be plenty of instances where you get punished for missing a shot by fully automatic weapons. That persistence will eventually payoff, as the M16A4 is arguably one of the best weapons in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-m16a4-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best M16A4 loadout in <em>XDefiant </em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Rapid Fire </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Superlight Grip </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>Reflex Sight </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Grip Tape </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Padded Stock </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">Every second matters while using a burst weapon. The quicker you can aim down sight with the M16A4, the more effective it will be. With that in mind, our loadout focuses on improving ADS speed, rate of fire, sprint speed, and recoil recovery. This set of attachments slightly hinders vertical and horizontal recoil, but not enough to be worth worrying about.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;faction for the <em>M16A4</em></h2> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="false">Choosing a faction comes down to personal preference. Still, the Cleaners provide the best set of abilities to make the M16A4 flourish. To start, the Incendiary Rounds kill enemies faster in short to medium-range engagements, which is perfect for the burst rifle, and the Firebomb ability is perfect for trying to clear off an objective on offense, or weaken an enemy to make them killable with one burst.</p>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League might not have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">done the numbers Warner Bros was expecting</a>, but developer Rocksteady continues onward with its post-launch plans, with its imminent Season 1 - Episode 2 update introducing new enemies, new gears, and more.
</p>
<p>
Season 1 - Episode 2 is a mid-season update for Kill the Justice League, and follows the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-first-season-kicks-off-with-the-joker-this-month"> arrival of The Joker as a playable character</a> at the end of March. As such, it's light on major headline features, but it does bring a few gameplay additions while players wait for the next big update.
</p>
<p>
For starters, The Joker's Elseworld map - introduced alongside the character - is "opening up further". This expanded version adds "tricky" Green Lantern infused enemies - immune to all direct damage until their Constructs have been destroyed - and the new Promotinaut enemy, capable of promoting its allies to their next, more powerful level of mutation.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Season 1 - Episode 2 introduces the new Out of Orbit mission. Here, players must topple corrupted Justice League Watchtowers, which have only partially phased into the world and are invulnerable to attack, by locking their control points so Task Force X can get stuck in. There's an added complication in that enemies can exist in one of two dimensions during the mission and players will need to keep switching dimensions to take them out.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there a "villain's banquet of all-new gear". Players can access three tiers of the Two-Face Infamy Set, alongside new gear from the likes of Black Manta, Reverse-Flash, and Firefly. Full patch notes - which include changes to the way Mastery Level progression is calculated and an increase for the base number of rewards earned from Metropolis missions - can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/315210/view/4166471135946509586">found on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Season 1 - Episode 2 update launches tomorrow, 23rd May, with three more seasons to follow according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">Rocksteady's road map</a>. Additionally, there's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/315210/Suicide_Squad_Kill_the_Justice_League/">60 percent off the Steam version</a> until 3rd June, bringing the price down to £23.99 for the standard edition if your interest is piqued.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell gave Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">three stars out of five in his review</a> back in February, saying "Rocksteady's talent is so evident in the game, it almost overcomes the terrible decision to try and make it."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/diana-jones-award-emerging-designer-winners-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming is coveted in the tabletop industry. Founded in 2001, the award is gifted to people, products, concepts, or groups that have demonstrated spectacular quality within the industry. Now we have Diana Jones Award 2024 Emerging Designer winners, highlighting new talent in the industry.</p>



<p>According to a post on their <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>, the Diana Jones Award for Emerging Designer went to four deserving winners. These winners were decided via an anonymous committee of 50 industry professionals, including designers, creatives, consultants, and publishers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rebuilding-seattle-game-pieces.jpg?itok=U_quI7Nt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rebuilding-seattle-game-pieces.jpg?itok=64vKYwgr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Elegance of design is recognized here.</figcaption></figure><p>The first of these winners is Quinn Brander. Brander was the creative voice behind 2023's <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368463/rebuilding-seattle" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Rebuilding Seattle</em></a>, an economic city-building game with a simple ruleset. He is working on a 2025 follow-up, <em>Rebuilding Chicago</em>, and an ambitious co-op roguelike campaign game.</p>

<p>Winner number two is Puerto-Rican British TTRPG designer and project manager Taylor Navarro. Navarro is a Big Bad Con Scholar whose work includes <em>Tales of Sina Una</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>D&amp;D 5e</em></a>, <em>The Seeker's Guide to Enchanting Emporiums</em>, and her own indie project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/taylornavarro/not-yet-a-romantic-ttrpg-duet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Not Yet: A Romantic Duet TTRPG</em></a>.</p>

<p>Notably, Taylor is recognized for her commitment to raising up fellow creators. She co-organized the Dragonmeet 2023 POC Lounge and Networking Mixer and regular contributor to the UK Tabletop Industry Network.</p>

Simpson's career began in videogame development but dove into board game development in 2019. Since then, he has been the co-designer on the award-winning board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368058/the-wolves" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Wolves</em></a> and designed <em>A Message From The Stars</em>, <em>Chomp</em>, and <em>Merchants of Magick</em>.</p>

<p>The fourth and final winner is Basil Wright. Wright's design philosophy is to make games that promote community, have a low barrier to entry, and draw magic from the mundane. Their body of work are notably weird entries like <em>Pelogos</em>, <em>You're Naked, Run!</em>, and <em>You Can (Not) Pet The Cat</em>.</p>

<p>All four winners will receive a prize package worth over $6500. The package includes a one-year voting membership in GAMA and an expenses-paid trip to Gen Con 2024.</p>

<p>Past winners of the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming have been venerable names in the industry. Those winners include Erlc Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>), the board game <em>Ticket To Rid</em>e, and the very concept of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-gauntlet-at-garden-rolls-dice-at-madison-square-garden"><em>Dimension20</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced"><em>Critical Role</em></a>.</p>

WB Games’ crossover platform fighter dropped in Open Beta in 2022, and the plan at the time seemed to be a smooth transition to a full launch. Instead the game was temporarily shut down, despite having run multiple Battle Passes and taking real money for skins and other cosmetics. Several months later, a relaunch is right around the corner with 1.0 scheduled for May 28, 2024. So, what happens to all that purchased content, and would there be any compensation for those founding players when <em>MultiVersus</em> returned? The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest wave of info</a></span> from developer Player First Games has laid it all out, and we’re here with the condensed version.</p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><h2 id="h7629"><a id=""></a>Will old purchases be retained?</h2><figure id="" data-id="c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-recommend-id="image://c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A MultiVersus graphic breaks down details about Perks, Fighters, Prestige, an Gleamium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A MultiVersus graphic breaks down details about Perks, Fighters, Prestige, an Gleamium." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-recommend-id="image://c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A MultiVersus graphic breaks down details about Perks, Fighters, Prestige, an Gleamium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So when it comes to rewards previously earned in Open Beta Battle Passes, as well as purchased characters, skins, and other cosmetics, the answer is yes. You’ll have all your stuff. One exception is Perks since that system is being overhauled, but real money wasn’t involved there. A new currency called Prestige was announced, which is earned through acquiring cosmetics and leads to more specialized cosmetics. Returning Open Beta players will get a chunk of Prestige currency upfront, based on their standing unlock collection.</p><h2 id="h7630"><a id=""></a>What about gold?</h2><p>Gold, which was the only in-game currency (aside from Gleamium, the real money currency) in the before times, is being removed entirely. Any unspent gold will be converted to “commemorative cosmetics” which are exclusive and, according to PFG, won’t be available otherwise. It’s unclear at the moment if these gold bonuses will then contribute to Prestige.</p><h2 id="h7631"><a id=""></a>Will character and Battle Pass tokens carry over?</h2><p>Yes! Like gold (and unlike Gleamium), tokens offered in the Founder’s Pack will not be a part of <em>MultiVersus</em> when 1.0 launches. However, any tokens players didn’t cash in before Open Beta ended will still be usable. So if you were saving your character tokens or hadn’t cashed in on Battle Passes yet, you’ll still be able to do so in 1.0.</p><h2 id="h7632"><a id=""></a>Will <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0 reward returning players?</h2><figure id="" data-id="a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-recommend-id="image://a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="561" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of MultiVersus' season 1 battle pass is shown, depicting the character of Jason as the first unlock rewarded." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of MultiVersus' season 1 battle pass is shown, depicting the character of Jason as the first unlock rewarded." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-recommend-id="image://a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="561" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of MultiVersus' season 1 battle pass is shown, depicting the character of Jason as the first unlock rewarded." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aside from what’s carrying over in the new <em>MVS</em> economy, Open Beta participants will also be rewarded in a couple of different ways for simply coming back. One of these ways is time-sensitive, while the other currently doesn’t have an expiration date.<br></p><p>If you played <em>MultiVersus</em> before and log into the new version <strong>before June 11, 2024</strong>, you’ll get access to the Season 1 Battle Pass. That comes with immediate access to <em>Friday the 13th</em>’s Jason Voorhees, who will be exclusive to the Battle Pass for the duration of the season. Afterwards he’ll show up for unlocking by other means, of course.</p><figure id="" data-id="61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-recommend-id="image://61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snow Suit Finn is pictured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snow Suit Finn is pictured." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-recommend-id="image://61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snow Suit Finn is pictured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also, Open Beta players coming back to <em>MultiVersus</em> at any time will get some goodies, namely a Snow Suit Finn character variant (<em>MVS</em>’ term for skins), a Rising Stars ringout animation, and a Banana Guard announcer pack.</p><h2 id="h7633"><a id=""></a>Any other freebies?</h2><figure id="" data-id="720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-recommend-id="image://720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Male and female variants of Banana Guard are shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Male and female variants of Banana Guard are shown." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-recommend-id="image://720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Male and female variants of Banana Guard are shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s also a little something for anyone who shows up for <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0. One of the new characters, Banana Guard from <em>Adventure Time</em>, will be a free unlock for everyone who completes the tutorial. The tutorial kicks off a seven-day calendar, which ends with a Lady Banana Guard character variant. Rewards for the other days aren’t specified.<br></p><p>To sum it all up, anything you had leftover from the <em>MultiVersus</em> Open Beta will either still be available, or converted in some way to fit into the game’s overhauled economy. You’ll also get a couple of bonus cosmetics, and full access to the first Battle Pass. Also, for funsies, everyone who shows up gets Banana Guard. On paper, that seems like a lot of stuff!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kr3br-3i8TY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>The Witcher</em> season four teaser.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It has been a tumultuous run for Netflix's popular adaptation of The Witcher novels and games. A series of setbacks and controversies led to a long delay after the show lost its star, Henry Cavill. Now a brief season four teaser gives us our first look at Cavill's replacement in the role of Geralt of Rivia, Liam Hemsworth.</p>
<p>The video above reveals little about the direction for the season beyond establishing that, yes, Hemsworth is now Geralt, and here's what it looks like. He looks the part, though it's hard for some fans to imagine him matching Cavill's pitch-perfect presence and delivery for the character.</p>
<p>See, Cavill is famously a passionate gamer. He's talked at length about his deep fandom of <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, his experiences playing <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and yes, his experiences with 2015's immensely popular open-world RPG <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>. He even has appeared in a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gYUVQrLzQ">building a gaming PC</a>.
</p><p>Rumors abounded when the former Superman actor announced he was departing Netflix's show after season three, including some rumors that he had left over creative differences with the showrunners over staying faithful to the spirit of the source material. We may never know the full story, but it looks like Cavill is on to bigger and better things: He's attached as producer and star of a major Marvel Cinematic Universe-scale effort by Amazon Studios to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/forget-the-witcher-and-superman-henry-cavill-to-lead-warhammer-40k-dream-project/">turn the lore-dense <em>Warhammer 40K</em></a> into a big-budget, live-action phenomenon.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The onboarding of Liam Hemsworth to the role was announced in tandem with Cavill's departure. Here's an excerpt from Cavill's statement at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf. As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men. Liam, good sir, this character has such a wonderful depth to him. Enjoy diving in and seeing what you can find.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been previously announced that the series' last season will be season five, so Hemsworth will portray the character for two seasons. Events in season three suggested that the show will, in the future, focus just as much on Freya Allen's Ciri, though.</p>
<p>Season four is currently in production and is expected to premiere on the streaming service in 2025.</p>

One of the biggest is an overhaul of the Well of Radiance super ability for Warlocks: one that players have relied on in Destiny 2's toughest content for years on end.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie detailed a whole lot of changes to various subclass abilities in an extensive <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/tfs-abilities-tuning-preview">blog post</a>, mirroring another big one it dropped last week <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-divinity-gun-is-getting-nerfed-in-the-final-shape/1100-6523497/">focused on weapon adjustments</a>. Well of Radiance is likely to have the biggest effect on the game, though. It drops a round location that a whole team of up to six players can stand in, boosting their weapons, healing them, and providing major defensive bonuses. That means that at least one Warlock character running Well of Radiance has been essential to basically every team playing high-level content since the super ability's introduction in the Forsaken expansion in 2017.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Final Shape, Bungie is looking to reduce the reliance on Well of Radiance so that it's an option in high-level content, but not a requirement--and therefore, players will have more options for how to approach tough fights, without some players being stuck filling a certain role. But that means that Well of Radiance is getting some adjustments and some nerfs; Bungie is altering the well so you don't have to stand right inside it quite so much, and making it less powerful, so that it doesn't effectively render players invulnerable, the way it does right now. The changes are amplifying Well as an offensive option but downgrading it as a defensive one.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's how Well is changing, as Bungie put it in its blog post:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Well of Radiance</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Now grants radiant for 8 seconds when players exit the Well of Radiance area.</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced player survivability while standing in the Well of Radiance aura.  <ul><li dir="ltr">Reduced healing per second from 100 to 50 health points, matching restoration x2.</li><li dir="ltr">Increased heal on cast from 40 to 300 health points.</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced damage resistance vs. non-boss combatants from 40% to 20%.</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced damage resistance vs. boss combatants from 40% to 10%.  <ul><li dir="ltr">Note: damage resistance vs. enemy players is unchanged.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Increased maximum Orbs of Power from defeating targets while in your Well of Radiance aura from 4 to 5.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, Bungie is also making adjustments to Ward of Dawn, the "Titan bubble" super ability. Right now, Ward doesn't see a ton of action because Well is usually a better option. It provides a ton of protection to anyone inside the bubble, as well as an overshield and a weapon buff called Weapons of Light to anyone who passes through it, but its applications are still a little limited--especially because you can't enjoy Ward's protection and still shoot at enemies, like you can with Well.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is amping up the defensive usefulness of Ward of Dawn to make it a more viable option, but scaling back its offensive side somewhat, according to the blog post. You'll now gain a Void overshield slowly even if you're close to the dome but not inside it, and the caster of Ward of Dawn can create more Orbs of Power for teammates by killing nearby enemies with melee attacks. But Bungie is removing the Weapons of Light buff from the super--to get that, you'll need to use the Helm of Saint-14 Exotic helmet along with your Titan bubble.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the complete rundown on Ward of Dawn changes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Ward of Dawn</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Armor of Light:  <ul><li dir="ltr">Removed Armor of Light overshield. Ward of Dawn now immediately applies a full Void Overshield to the caster and allies that enter its dome.</li><li dir="ltr">Armor of Light now instead grants additional damage resistance to players inside the Ward of Dawn:30% vs. enemy players and 60% vs. enemy combatants.  <ul><li dir="ltr">Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn dome remains roughly the same as it was before vs. PvE combatants.</li><li dir="ltr">Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn is significantly lower than it was before vs other players in PvP, and cannot be further increased by stacking Bastion Barricades inside the Ward to gain additional Overshield layers.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Allies near the Ward of Dawn dome now have Void Overshield trickled on over time, similar to the volume behind a Bastion barricade.</li><li dir="ltr">No longer provides Weapons of Light by default. This behavior has been moved to the benefits of Helm of Saint-14.</li><li dir="ltr">The Ward of Dawn caster can now generate additional Orbs of Power by defeating enemies with melee attacks in or near their Ward of Dawn dome.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Bungie's blog post covers a <em>ton</em> more changes to supers and abilities that go well beyond Well of Radiance and Ward of Dawn, though. Adjustments are being made to make some Arc subclasses a little more viable than they currently are, specifically for Hunters, while Bungie is applying some significant nerfs to others. Some of the most-used Strand abilities, like Titans' Banner of War, are seeing some nerfs, and Bungie is rebalancing other stuff all over the board. Check out the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/tfs-abilities-tuning-preview">full blog post</a> for all the details--just make sure you clear a little time, because you're going to be reading for a while.</p>

As of now, 67 percent of players show less interest in strategic thinking over the last nine years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, no specific cause was determined beyond a "larger, long-term cultural/psychological shift."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with that, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.steamdata.ninja/genre/Strategy">SteamData</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows strategy games have grown since 2015.

For example, player counts for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/281990/charts/#max">Stellaris</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/#max">Civilization 6</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have shot up and down, depending on the launch of a new expansion or mechanic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it's worth noting those are well-established games. Speaking to Game Developer, Quantic Foundry's Nick Yee noted strategy players are putting their time toward well-known games and franchises, just at less intensive difficulties.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The strategy space has gotten simpler, and gradually turned more niche.

A shift in the larger player demographic (old and new alike) means they may "care dramatically less" about the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yee also pointed out the strategy decline isn't gender-specific. This reduction is "remarkably consistent" for men and women, and equally so for US and non-US players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In general, no one demographic or cause appears to be responsible. The pandemic couldn't be blamed, but it was speculated to have "exacerbated or prolonged" the fall-off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, the study hypothesized this be owed to a larger cultural shift toward short attention spans. The rise of shorter videos and computer app usage was noted, along with a greater sense of cognitive overload.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Quantic Foundry notes, this implies players "prefer shorter time horizons to plan for...and less complex decisions that rely on fewer parameters to consider."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The full study from Quantic Foundry can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2024/05/21/strategy-decline/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">The&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>S Tier compiles the best Assault Rifles, SMGs, and LMGs to use. Most of the list showcases ARs, each with their&nbsp;own&nbsp;beneficial usage. For example, the M16A4 excels in both long and close-range attacks. It’s rare to see an Assault Rifle have such a range, but this unique feature will undoubtedly make matches much more accessible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="866" data-injectable="true">Although I’ve always been an SMG enthusiast, I was surprised that an LMG could have enough power to reach S Tier.

The M60 is an excellent choice as an LMG due to its significant ammo size and elite firepower. I’ve gone up the ranks several times using this bad boy, and it always comes in clutch, no matter the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">But if you prefer even more mobility, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP7</a> SMG is your best bet. Everything about this gun feels smooth in movement speed, which could make it easier to run from gunfire.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">Aside from the MP7, the Vector .45 ACP is one of the best-starting weapons in&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>. The only reason it’s at the A Tier is due to its reduced mobility stats. It’s still a good SMG, but if you want more ammo, go for the P90.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">For those who&nbsp;prefer a more strategic, long-range approach, the Marksman SVD and Sniper TAC-50 are your best friends. The SVD, with its one-shot kill potential, and the TAC-50, a superb choice for precision shots, will give you the edge you need in&nbsp;long-range combat.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">The 686 Magnum is a standout among the Secondary Weapons in&nbsp;<em>XDefiant,</em>&nbsp;earning its place in the A Tier.&nbsp;It boasts the highest firepower and superior accuracy for long distances, making it a formidable choice.</p>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, Shotguns aren’t the best weapons&nbsp;to use, so only one made it to B Tier. The Double Barrel offers the highest amount of damage at the cost of accuracy.&nbsp;Others, like the MDR and AA-12,&nbsp;aren’t up&nbsp;to&nbsp;par, but this could change with buff updates.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="false">Depending on your playstyle,&nbsp;the B and C Tiers could&nbsp;still&nbsp;prove valuable.&nbsp;Though,&nbsp;I would steer clear of the C Tier to save you the headache, especially with their lower damage rates and slower movement. </p>

And now, as the second part of the first season finally arrives, some new, ugly skins have confused and angered players. </p><p>On May 22, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1cy3014/opinions_on_these/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1cy3014/opinions_on_these/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Suicide Squad</em> players spotted new cosmetic items</a></span> in the in-game store. The new skins are inspired by how The Joker looks during the end of <em>Arkham Asylum</em> after ingesting the Titan compound and turning into a giant, hideous monster. The new <em>Suicide Squad</em> skins feature exposed bone, blood, and scars and don’t look great! They do remind me that <em>Arkham Ayslum</em>’s ending was bad though...</p><p>Over on Reddit, <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s dwindling playerbase—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/315210/charts/#max&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/315210/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which most days hovers around less than 350 on Steam DB’s charts</a></span>—was unhappy and annoyed about the new “Titan” skins, calling them ugly, terrible, and bad.</p><figure id="" data-id="a0c5f8ac5aafa2ed0db44774fdfa14be" data-recommend-id="image://a0c5f8ac5aafa2ed0db44774fdfa14be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows comments found on Reddit about the new skins.

(Though <em>some </em>Joker mains seemed to like his specific version of the Titan skin.) </p><p>It’s possible that on May 23, when the next part of the current season arrives—bringing with it new gear, missions, and abilities—the playerbase will turn around on <em>Suicide Squad </em>and its numbers will skyrocket on consoles and PC. However, that’s looking more and more doubtful as the few remaining players seem tired of the lack of updates, the bad skins, and grinding endlessly for little reward. I’m not sure even Batman or Superman could save the day at this point. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When people think of<em> X-Men </em>games they mostly think of action titles that let you mow through enemies as iconic characters like Cyclops and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-morph-wolverine-romance-love-gay-non-binary-1851484402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-morph-wolverine-romance-love-gay-non-binary-1851484402">Wolverine</a></span> with reckless abandon. Those are all well and good, but they miss out on the best part of the<em> X-Men</em>: the relationships! Beyond fighting off evil humans, evil mutants, and evil robots, the<em> X-Men</em> have always been about a large cast of loveable outcasts growing and bonding with each other. We need a game that brings that to the forefront. With its heavy emphasis on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540">social links</a></span>, in which players bond with characters to learn new story beats as well as unlock powerful mechanics for combat, <em>Persona</em> is the series to look to for inspiration. </p><p>Furthermore, the next<em> X-Men</em> game should also be set in a school. While both the Fox movies and the recent X-Men ‘97 series feature the school as a location, the school life of the Xavier Institute’s students is never front and center—it takes a backseat to the heroics. The Institute is one of the main settings for the comics, but since the <em> X-Men</em>’s most iconic characters are adults, the actual school aspects of the location never seem all that important. </p><figure id="" data-id="677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-recommend-id="image://677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl with glasses talking to the Persona 3 protagonist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl with glasses talking to the Persona 3 protagonist" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SEGA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-recommend-id="image://677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl with glasses talking to the Persona 3 protagonist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But I’m here to tell you that it’s essential. As demonstrated in comics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472">Grant Morrison’s <em>New X-Men</em></a></span><em> </em>and Jason Aaron’s <em>Wolverine and the X-Men</em>, a major part of the mutant story is about how the new generation of mutants is taught by the old guard. Putting players in the shoes of a new student is a way to acclimate them to the complex world of the <em>X-Men</em> and introduce them to fascinating characters and a myriad of activities to pursue. Teaching them about what’s going on in this strange world is literally the point of a school!<br></p><p>Oh, and this <em>Persona</em>-esque <em>X-Men</em> game should not put you in the boots of the most iconic, characters. At this point, playing as Wolverine or Cyclops is tired and boring—these are are characters that have been done to death. Instead, those characters should be NPCs taking on roles as professors at the Institute. That gives them a key role without forcing the game to be entirely about them. There are so many interesting young mutants that deserve their chance in the limelight. Be it the New Mutants, Generation X, or Morrison’s unique cast of newbies (like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Herman_(Earth-616)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Herman_(Earth-616)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glob Herman</a></span>), fresh faces are the best way to go for a new<em> X-Men</em> game. </p><p>Mechanically, the school then operates as it does in a <em>Persona</em> title. Players can spend their days in the progressing in-game calendar choosing to boost certain skills: Combat could be improved by going to the Danger Room, you could increase your intelligence by studying with Beast, and more. All of this would then be supported by social links with different professors and fellow students.</p><figure id="" data-id="9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-recommend-id="image://9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A class of mutants sitting in desks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A class of mutants sitting in desks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-recommend-id="image://9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A class of mutants sitting in desks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The social sim aspects would be balanced with combat, like sending players out on missions that function similarly to <em>Persona</em>’s dungeons. Picking and choosing your party of X-Men and fighting off iconic enemies satisfies the need to live the power fantasy of a superhero with some customization options to boot. A varied list of party members could shine the spotlight on some beloved but lesser-known characters. It also gels with the way the team is represented in the comics: part strike force, and part student body.

While that’s exciting, it means my pipe dream of a <em>Persona</em>-like <em>X-Men</em> title is even further from reality, as Insomniac sits pretty squarely in the traditional third-person action space. But that won’t stop me from hoping that one day I’ll get that perfect<em> X-Men</em> game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But like any long-running franchise, the series has had its high points and low points. With a bunch of new players and old fans alike about to jump into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123">Disney</a></span> x <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-sephiroth-boss-olympus-coliseum-ff7-1851367491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-sephiroth-boss-olympus-coliseum-ff7-1851367491"><em>Final Fantasy </em>crossover</a></span>, we thought we’d pit 11 bad bitches against each other and rank the series from worst to best. Grab your keyblades and your closest anthropomorphic animal friend, it’s time to start a keyblade war.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts χ</em> is one of the most divisive things Square Enix has ever done with the Disney RPG series, as it presents one of the most pivotal, foundational pieces of storytelling the franchise has had up to this point in a mobile gacha game. The events of <em>χ </em>are hinted at throughout the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>franchise, but you’re mostly operating in the aftermath of what is set in motion by this game. It has some neat ideas, such as letting you create your own character within the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>universe, and while getting to it is a time sink, the story is pretty compelling for long-time fans. But it’s a baffling example of how cumbersome Square’s handling of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ worldbuilding has been over the past 20 years.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts Coded</em>, while mostly fine to play, is one of the more contrived entries in the series. The mobile game and its DS remake ooze “made just to put a <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game on the platform,” and its place in the series’ ongoing plot is so flimsy that it doesn’t have much reason to exist. It largely was made to reuse old Disney worlds by digitizing records of Sora’s past adventures into a virtual world as a roundabout way of explaining a message Sora receives from Mickey at the end of <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>, though there are some more substantial scenes at the end of the <em>Re:coded </em>DS remake. Ultimately, it’s the definition of a filler game in a series that doesn’t usually have those.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> had a whole lot of storylines and character arcs to wrap up by the time it was finally released in 2019, including the story of Aqua, one of the heroes of <em>Birth by Sleep</em>. Rather than bloat the game further with those details, Square Enix cut a slice of <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> out to release it in the <em>2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> package and call it <em>Birth by Sleep: A Fragmentary Passage</em>. The prelude is a short, sweet taste of what would come in <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, and gave fans a chance to reacquaint themselves with Aqua, who had been hidden away in the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>equivalent of purgatory since the events of <em>Birth by Sleep</em>. The most important thing it does, though, is explain why Mickey wasn’t wearing a shirt at the end of the original <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>. Priorities.<br></p></div><div><p>Perhaps the most universally adored part of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is composer Yoko Shimomura’s incredible score. It perfectly marries tributes to the Disney source material with an emotional earnestness that has perfectly punctuated every world and moment. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-might-be-enough-to-sav-1845725522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-might-be-enough-to-sav-1845725522"><em>Melody of Memory</em></a></span>, the latest game in the series, is a rhythm game that pays tribute to Shimomura’s work. Because this is a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> game, it still has to tie into the story and have some big narrative reveal at the eleventh hour, but even with the contrived framing of searching through Kairi’s memories to facilitate a rhythm track, <em>Melody of Memory </em>is a delight to play and a reminder that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ soundtrack is a stunning collection of compositions.<br></p></div><div><p>Part of me wants to be sympathetic to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-3-5th-anniversary-ending-1851209676&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-3-5th-anniversary-ending-1851209676"><em>Kingdom Hearts III</em></a></span> because after over a decade of fans waiting for another numbered entry, there was no game that could have reasonably met the lofty expectations Square Enix set itself up for by releasing spin-off after spin-off, building up both the series’ lore and the anticipation for a climactic conclusion. Sora, Donald, and Goofy’s latest Disney world-trotting adventure has some really standout moments. The <em>Toy Story </em>and <em>Monsters Inc.</em> worlds made great use of Pixar stories, and the <em>Tangled</em> chapter is a pretty lovingly crafted retelling of a modern classic. But there are some duds here, too. The <em>Frozen</em> world feels especially beholden to corporate chains that likely prevented the studio from riffing on the original story, and the <em>Big Hero 6</em> world starts out strong but ends up completely contradicting core themes of the source material. Meanwhile, some of the returning worlds like Olympus and the Caribbean squander the opportunity to offer more exciting detours.</p><p>But overall, it feels like <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>falls victim to the unmanageable weight of expectations. Its attempts to wrap up every storyline the series had been setting up for nearly 20 years feel rushed in the eleventh hour; the floaty, button-mashy gameplay feels like it hadn’t learned much from the last decade of action RPGs; and its inclusion of the reliance on theme-park-based ride attacks becomes a burdensome bore. When <em>Kingdom Hearts III </em>hits, it <em>really fucking hits</em>. But too often, it can’t seem to get out of its own way.</p></div><div><p>Looking back, it’s kind of wild how well <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> manages to introduce characters like Roxas and Axel without giving you the full rundown on their whole deal. But luckily, fans wouldn’t have to wait very long for them to get their own prequel game in 2009’s <em>358/2 Days</em>. The DS game tells the story of Roxas coming up in the villainous Organization XIII, and introduces another fan favorite in Xion. Even for a DS game, <em>358/2 Days </em>does a pretty solid job at recreating the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series’ action, and lets you play as multiple characters from across the series, each with distinct playstyles. It’s sadly not playable in modern remasters, as the <em>1.5 Remix </em>compilation only includes its cutscenes so newcomers can familiarize themselves with its story. But at the time, it was a solid effort to bring the series to the DS, and proved, like <em>Chain of Memories </em>before it, that the non-numbered <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games could have substance and be vital pieces of the overarching puzzle.<br></p></div><div><p>2012’s <em>Dream Drop Distance</em> was the final setup game before <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, and it manages to spin a lot of meaningful character development into weighty lore dumps, though the latter sure takes some time to show up. Unlike a lot of other spin-offs, <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>isn’t as reliant on old worlds, is one of the best versions of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ combat on a handheld, and properly sets Sora on a path to personal growth in <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>. It took several years for Square Enix to follow up on its world-shattering cliffhangers buried after a lot of filler, but <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>was a reminder that when <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>has intention, the team can cook. It also gave us the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_az9H864IA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_az9H864IA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic scene of Mickey getting choked out by Xemnas</a></span>. Your fave could never.<br></p></div><div><p>This will probably be one of the more controversial placements on this list, but this is my party and I’ll stan <em>Chain of Memories </em>if I want to. <em>Chain of Memories</em>, the Game Boy Advance deck-building game, set the standard for what <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>would become. Sora’s trek through Castle Oblivion is the first spin-off and establishes that every <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game would matter in the long run. <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>’s opening hours make zero sense if you haven’t played <em>Chain of Memories</em>, and even after it’s made its own introductions, so much of the sequel (and the franchise at large) is building off of it nearly 20 years later. The Riku route you unlock after beating the game? A cultural reset.<br></p><p>On top of setting the tone for the rest of the franchise, <em>Chain of Memories </em>is an incredibly underrated deck builder. The cards you have inform your combos, abilities, and strategies within an action game framework that was pretty impressive for the GBA. Its sprite work is still gorgeous to this day, and god, I wish the original was more readily available. <em>Chain of Memories </em>was remade for the PlayStation 2 as <em>Re: Chain of Memories</em>, which does away with the 2D style for something that resembles the original game on console. That’s the version that has been ported to every system under the sun, and it is, in my opinion, far inferior. Sure, it’s got voice acting and some mechanical tweaks, but it’s not the same, dammit.</p></div><div><p>I don’t believe the “<em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is too complicated” meme, but looking back at the series’ twists, turns, and retcons, there’s something refreshing about how straightforward that original <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-ps2-23rd-anniversary-legacy-1850966714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-ps2-23rd-anniversary-legacy-1850966714">PlayStation 2</a></span> game was. Sora’s debut has issues. It’s a poster child for finicky cameras of the era and the Gummi Ship mini-game is dreadfully dull, but man, remember what it felt like hearing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-utada-hikaru-simple-clean-re-recording-1851490877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-utada-hikaru-simple-clean-re-recording-1851490877">“Simple and Clean”</a></span> for the first time? That ending was the first time a video game made me cry, and the waterworks have not stopped since.</p><p>The original <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is still one of the best deliveries on the Disney crossover concept. As the series has gone on, the Disney worlds have started to feel like an afterthought as Square Enix has prioritized the series’ own lore. But Sora and concepts like the Heartless and Keyblade were so well integrated into those stories that seeing the childlike wonder of that first game fall to the background makes the original game feel like the calm before the storm. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> </a></span>seems to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-sora-graphics-tetsuya-nomura-q-1848793366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-sora-graphics-tetsuya-nomura-q-1848793366">expanding this universe even further</a></span>, so it’s unlikely we’ll ever see something this pure out of the series again.</p></div><div><p><em>Birth by Sleep </em>on the PlayStation Portable was a paradigm shift for the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>franchise. The prequel completely recontextualizes everything we know about the universe, all while introducing three new, beloved heroes in Terra, Aqua, and Ventus. <em>Birth by Sleep </em>is a dense, tragic setup for what would come in the years between it and <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, and somehow managed to introduce characters fans have come to love as much as its original trio.</p><p>Even on the PlayStation Portable, <em>Birth by Sleep </em>is a solid recreation of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ spectacle with some interesting accommodations for the handheld’s lack of buttons. It’s also home to some of the best mini-games in the series, which has been fraught territory for <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>over the years. The best parts of it shine even brighter on consoles in the <em>2.5 HD Remix</em> collection.</p></div><div><p>You ever feel like you’re still in search of a high a game made you feel as a child? <em>Kingdom Hearts II </em>is one of those games. To this day, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is the full package of the best parts of the franchise. Soundtrack? 10/10. The action-based combat’s blend of style and substance? Unmatched. The compelling melodrama mixing <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Disney</em>, and the original characters? Imprinted on my soul.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> remains the series’ highest high. It successfully knocks down every pin the first game and <em>Chain of Memories</em> sets up, has memorable Disney worlds like <em>Mulan</em>, <em>Tron</em>, and <em>The Lion King</em> (Sora’s lion transformation is iconic), and also features some incredible action set pieces like the final boss run in which Sora and Riku take down Xemnas. If you grew up with this game like I did, tell me you weren’t thinking of that fight as you were playing the final fight of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. That shit was unforgettable. But also unforgettable was the debrief between Sora and Riku that follows, in which the series’ two leads finally reach an understanding after three games of being rivals. God, it’s perfect, and leads into a similarly perfect ending.</p><p>There’s probably a universe in which <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>ended after <em>II</em> and was largely remembered as a near-universally beloved action RPG series that escalated into darker, more complex territory in the sequel. Even as it introduces new concepts and characters, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is pretty reasonable as a sequel before every spin-off that followed built <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> into an <em>Avengers</em>-level crossover event. <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is the pinnacle of what the series could have been, and while I’m not mad that it’s continued, I do feel like as the series has gone on, it has gotten less succinct in its themes, mechanics, and the worlds it’s explored. Now that <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> has concluded one story, I guess we’ll see if the series can peel back those layers and scale back to something this pure. But even if it doesn’t, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is a summation of the best things the franchise has ever done.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Choosing to go free-to-play in a gacha game like <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a great option. While the very top-tier content might be rough, you can still play every adventure, mission, and quest without issue.</p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">The truth is that free-to-play games are designed to get some kind of investment out of many of the folks who play them. If you are happy to go on a slow grind and take advantage of all the free resources and items, you can enjoy everything that is available, for free. Will you get your parties to the same overpowered level as those who are willing to pay? It seems unlikely, but you can still have a lot of fun.</p>
 <h2 id="h-all-free-wuthering-waves-characters" data-injectable="false">All free Wuthering Waves characters</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">The main way to get free characters in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is to play through the story. Certain story beats will introduce new characters, and they may end up joining your party for free, giving you your first instance of the character. You can still earn them from pulls, getting additional Resonance Chains or special currencies to spend on other things.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rover (Spectro)</h3> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Rover is the main protagonist of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and at the start of the game, you will need to pick between a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-pick-the-male-or-female-rover-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male or female version</a> of the character. The Rover is a pretty solid starting character overall who can dish out some good damage but also has solid defense due to strong parrying ability. They are effectively designed to fill in gaps in your party without needing to be the main focus at all. They are someone that you can replace if a better character comes along, but they can definitely get the job done for you. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Chixia (Fusion)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">Chixia is a Fusion character that you will get extremely early in the game. She is ranged and uses her guns to pump out plenty of single-target damage, but will struggle to find quick clears against large groups. I really feel her potential single-target damage will make up for this, giving players a very reliable source of damage to their party. Her parry game is weak, but you can abuse certain Echoes to take advantage of i-frames, and she does come with a dash if you need a get-out-of-jail-free card. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Yangyang (Aero)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">Yangyang is a Support character that you meet in the Prologue, giving you your first taste of someone who will live off-field. The point of Yangyang is to perform her full combo and then allow you to switch back to your main or sub-DPS, depending on what you need to do. She is actually a very strong character, and effort and resources invested in a Support is rarely wasted. Unless you plan on aiming for Vernia, Yangyang can really act as a solid Support option. The bad news is that she can’t do much to help with damage, so you either take advantage of her ability to group or get little additional benefit out of her rotation.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Baizhi (Glacio)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="574" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Another Support, Baizhi offers a very solid alternative to Yangyang. Truthfully, you will be very happy you have both of them when it comes to Tower runs. Which one you use will depend a lot on your other characters, but Baizhi can offer a fantastic damage buff to the next character you switch to, so keep that in mind. Baizhi slots in very well almost everywhere, so it is a superb gap filler for any awkward Support needs. I would actually recommend you level her before Yangyang, frankly, because she will hold up really well even after you get stronger support options.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Sanhua (Glacio)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="865" data-injectable="true">Sanhua is an excellent sub-DPS because you can drop a load of damage and then switch to a main DPS that has more demanding on-field time. I’d really suggest leaning heavily into her burst damage over worrying too much about basic attacking, as there will be better options available to you for that. You absolutely need to work in some attacks to your rotation, but the real focus with her should be dropping as much nuke as you can, as quickly as you can. She is definitely worth investing in and will pay dividends when those damage numbers start to climb. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Yuanwu (Electro)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">Yuanwu is a default beginner character. He is basic attack-focused, and his damage scales with defense, so he is somewhat low-risk. He uses Gauntlets and will basically punch everything around him. Unfortunately, I feel that I’m going to spend way too much time with Yuanwu, as I think he is a bit weak, but I love his kit and feel. At the end of the day, the game is about having fun, not just making the numbers get bigger.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Those are all the free characters for now, but we will keep this updated as more arrive, hopefully with further story expansion. You will also be able to earn the currency you need to unlock other characters from the Banners, so don’t worry about struggling to build up your teams.</p>

<p data-characters="362" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The final week of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s The Pantheon has arrived, featuring a whopping eight bosses and one mean Power disadvantage. Whether Guardians just want a clear for that sweet Emblem, or they’re pushing to hit a Platinum score on each encounter for the Godslayer Title, they’ll want to know what to expect from The Pantheon: Nezarec Sublime.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">The Pantheon is a limited-time boss rush mode in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, featuring encounters tuned to inch up the difficulty. Alongside encounter reworks, players also go against a Power disadvantage, starting at -5 in The Pantheon’s first bout and going up to -20 for Nezarec Sublime. While regular Raids can already be challenging, The Pantheon demands mastery, quick thinking, and coordination.</p> <h2 id="h-modifiers-matter" data-injectable="false">Modifiers matter</h2> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">For The Pantheon: Nezarec Sublime, players have a few helpful modifiers to regain control in the encounters. First up is the return of Shot Caller from The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted. This modifier offers increased Special and Heavy weapon damage on top of damage resistance. Players can trigger the modifier by landing three precision shots in rapid succession.</p> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">Alongside Shot Caller are the Solar and Strand Surges. Each Surge empowers matching elemental weapons, meaning players will want an arsenal of Solar and Strand weapons for Nezarec Sublime. Of particular note, The Parasite, Whisper of the Worm, Apex Predator, Sleeper Stimulant, Sunshot, and Scatter Signal all work marvelously, depending on the specific encounter.</p>

 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Some of these encounters can feel very different with the Power disadvantage and different Surges active. If players are struggling to overcome a boss, just remember to play to the strengths of the Surges and Shot Caller and to equip relevant Resistance mods on armor.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Riven</h2> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Riven mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">Most players are used to passing over Riven with a bit of cheese, but that’s not going to work anymore. Guardians will have to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-how-to-defeat-riven-legit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn how to defeat Riven legit</a>&nbsp;if they want a chance at toppling Nezarec. That said, once you know what to do, the fight is easier than it’s been made out to be.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Riven changes</h3> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Of course, the most significant change is that you can’t cheese Riven anymore. This used to be done by having the whole Fireteam go into one room together and then use a glitch to respawn back at the start if Riven didn’t appear. For The Pantheon, that method is defunct, and Guardians must do all of the mechanics in the encounter.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">Outside of doing Riven as intended, there are more enemies, and naturally, at a -20 Power disadvantage, they can hit like a truck. Doing the encounter’s mechanics safely will be the real challenge, with the only other notable change being that Riven sports additional resistance on the lower floors.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Nezarec</h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Nezarec mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Nezarec is the final boss in the Root of Nightmares Raid and the last encounter in The Pantheon. Like other encounters with several mechanics happening simultaneously, it’s easiest to approach the fight with pre-assigned roles and an understanding of how everything comes together. The Fireteam will want to assign two players as runners and another one or two for tanking/kiting. The remaining players will focus on clearing the arena of enemies. The arena itself is separated into three lanes, with platforms dotted around the left and right lanes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">At the edge of the left and right lanes closest to the Rally flag, players will notice a plate with either a Light or Dark node (Dark on the right, Light on the left). This is the starting point for each runner. The tank team/player should stay far back in the middle lane, by the rally flag, and the ad clear players are free to move about so long as they don’t put themselves in danger.</p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="859" data-injectable="true">To start the encounter, each runner can shoot their respective node to gain a buff, either Flux of Darkness or Flux of Light. The runners then want to look at the platforms closest to their plate and head to the one with a small black orb floating above it. Standing on the plate and damaging the orb transfers the buff, activating that platform. Players must activate all platforms on both sides to push into a damage phase. However, there are a couple of catches.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">After runners expend their buff, they can return to the starting plate to get another. That said, the buff-giving plate will move after players have activated it a few times. This means runners must keep an eye out after activating a plate to ensure they’re running the right way toward a rebuff. The other consideration in this relay race is Nezarec himself.</p>
 <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">Soon after starting the encounter (usually when runners are heading to their second plate), Nezarec will raise a hand in the air, which starts bouncing random players around. This will make it almost impossible for runners to do their job, so this is where the tank comes into play. Using a sniper, the tank must shoot the crit spot on both of the boss’ shoulders. This will elicit a flash of color (either white for Light or orange for Darkness), which should be communicated to the rest of the team.</p>
 <p data-characters="667" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">Shortly after the flash of color, Nezarec’s chest will light up so the tank can take a precision shot. Popping his chest debuffs the tank with Nezarec’s Hatred, which makes the boss jump down and chase the player for as long as they have the debuff. This will buy the runners additional time to activate plates until Nezarec starts to glow. When this happens, the runner of the opposite color called out must reacquire their Flux buff and use it on an activated platform matching the color Nezarec flashed. For example, if Nezarec flashed white after popping his shoulders, the Darkness runner would rebuff and use the buff on an activated Light platform.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">If done correctly, the platform in question will provide any player that passes over it with a shield buff called Light or Darkness Refuge that prevents Nezarec’s wipe mechanic. It’s important to note that the shield doesn’t last very long, so players will want to ensure they rebuff if it expires before Nezarec erupts. With the wipe avoided, Nezarec will return to his balcony, and players can finish activating any lingering platforms.</p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Once all platforms on the left and right are activated, they’ll emit a beam of light to signal the phase switch. The Fireteam should all gather at one predetermined platform and play it safe until a beam pierces through Nezarec. Once that happens, Guardians can unload everything they have on the boss. Nezarec won’t just sit there and take the damage, though. The boss will attack players from the ground and the air, sometimes even teleporting around.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">At the end of the damage phase, if Guardians don’t do enough to push the boss, Nezarec will teleport back up to the balcony, and the whole cycle will start again. If players can push the boss, he’ll enter a final stand where the team has one last chance to finish Nezarec off.&nbsp;</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Nezarec changes</h3> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Alongside the Power disadvantage, a few changes to Nezarec will make the fight more difficult. The most notable thing is that if players stand on a plate for too long, it explodes. This means that Guardians must be especially careful when trying to get their Refuge buff.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">It also makes it more challenging to plan a safe locale for damage. Fireteams can try avoiding stationary damage altogether and follow the boss with a couple Well of Radiance Supers and The Lament sword, or they can try to lure the boss towards the starting Darkness node before damage starts to make use of the safe root jutting out from the side of the arena.</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="false">In addition to exploding plates, Tormentors and Cabal Colossus will be running rampant, but thankfully, their defeat is not required for groups to get a Platinum score. The Colossus, however, are shielded with Light or Darkness.&nbsp;The Fireteam can have an&nbsp;add clear&nbsp;player stand on the buff-giving plate with a runner so they get the buff&nbsp;as well and can then&nbsp;eliminate the Colossus, or players can stun or blind the foes.</p>

			<p>It's been just a day since the official launch of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, and PC gamers can already improve their experience with the first few mods.</p>
<p>First, the Flat2VR community showed off a Virtual Reality mod for the single player cinematic game released by Ninja Theory. Thanks to Praydog's <a href="https://wccftech.com/uevr-public-beta-makes-dozens-of-thousands-of-unreal-engine-games-vr-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEVR tool</a>, Hellblade II already works with full 6DOF VR and can be played in first-person or third-person view.</p>
<p>You will need to grab the profile from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ZFSCSDe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flat2VR Discord</a> to get it properly set up. Also, make sure you're using a powerful PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hellblade 2 VR Mod Out Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YLX6B-9nRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is full of postprocessing effects like depth of field, motion blur, chromatic aberration, lens distortion, film grain, and forced letterboxing (black bars). While most of those are essential to the artistic vision devised by Ninja Theory, they may also be distasteful or even sickening (in the case of motion blur especially) to some gamers.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's already an easy-to-use mod to remove them all available for download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. These are the simple steps required for installation:</p>
<p><em><span>1. Download the zip file and extract it.<br>
2. Copy/cut the files to this location:<br>
</span></em></p>
<figure>
<blockquote><p><em>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hellblade2\Saved\Config\Windows\</em></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p><em><span>3. Replace the file.</span></em></p>
<p>However, for players interested in disabling only specific effects, here's how to do it manually. You will have to open the Engine.ini file located in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Hellblade2\Saved\Config\Windows\ folder.</p>
<p>Then, add the following text at the bottom of the file, depending on which effects you want to disable.</p>
<pre>[SystemSettings]
r.FilmGrain=0
r.NT.Lens.Distortion.Intensity=0
r.NT.Lens.Distortion.Stretch=0
r.NT.Lens.ChromaticAberration.Intensity=0
r.NT.DOF.RotationalBokeh=0
r.NT.DOF.NTBokehTransform=0
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.NT.AllowAspectRatioHorizontalExtension=0
r.NT.EnableConstrainAspectRatio=0
r.AntiAliasingMethod=0
</pre>
<p>Do note that removing the forced letterboxing (the black bars) has two side effects. The first and most obvious one is a decrease in performance since those pixels will have to be rendered after the tweak. The second is a zoomed-in camera effect due to the lack of a proper field of view slider.</p>
<p>You can find my Senua's Saga: Hellblade II review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Earlier today, Ninja Theory <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-price-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent out a thank you message</a> to the community for the 'incredible response' to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162032/evil-does-not-exists-ending-explained-by-director-ryusuke-hamaguchi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="u8wN8S">You don’t even have to watch <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24153139/evil-does-not-exist-review-ryusuke-hamaguchi">Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em></a> to consider it a conversation-starter: The debate begins with that title, a bold, unlikely statement that may feel at odds with most experiences of the world. Watching the movie complicates that response even further, given some of the choices its characters make, and the harm they bring to others. And then there’s that abrupt, surprising ending, the kind that will leave viewers arguing over what they actually saw on screen almost as much as they’re arguing about what it means. </p>
<p id="yqpj2e">Hamaguchi is no stranger to elliptical, unpackable, or discussable endings: His Best Picture Oscar nominee <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22947711/drive-my-car-deserves-best-picture-oscar"><em>Drive My Car</em></a> wraps with a long sequence where the audience is just watching the protagonist perform onstage in a multilingual production of Anton Chekhov’s <em>Uncle Vanya</em>, followed by a wordless sequence of another character going about mundane tasks. There’s a great deal of meaning there, but it takes thought, time, and attention to the film’s 179-minute length to access. <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> is shorter and tighter, but it still <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/05/evil-does-not-exist-ryusuke-hamaguchi-movie-drive-my-car.html">centers on a 20-minute scene</a> where residents of a small community politely raise objections about a planned luxury development in the area.</p>
<p id="vWEAOU">What is Hamaguchi getting at with <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em>? From its title to its mysterious opening tracking shot to that what’s-going-on-here? ending, Polygon had a lot of questions about the movie. Speaking through a translator, we sat down with Hamaguchi to unpack the film.  </p>
<p id="AXiwvH">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> End spoilers ahead for <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em>.]</p>
<h2 id="cqx7yV"><strong>First: on the ending Evil Does Not Exist</strong></h2>
<div id="HA3KxF"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVY4lWfrbME?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="A6aUWS"><em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> centers on a small rural village, Mizubiki, that’s about to be disrupted by developers building a site for luxury camping, or “glamping.” At a town-hall meeting, the locals object, and their thoughtful, thorough analysis of the project’s flaws impresses the presenters, Takahashi (Ryuji Kosaka) and Mayuzumi (Ayaka Shibutani). But when they share the objections with their boss, they learn he doesn’t actually care about making the project sustainable or even profitable. He just cares about the pandemic-era development grants he’ll earn if he gets the proposal in ahead of a deadline.</p>
<p id="F3VX5s">Takahashi and Mayuzumi connect with Takumi (Hitoshi Omika), a widower and odd-job man in Mizubiki, who’s raising a young daughter, Hana (Ryo Nishikawa), on his own. Takumi is a quiet man who’s closely connected with nature, and Takahashi envies him and wants to move out to Mizubiki and live in nature himself. But then Hana goes missing, and the town rallies to find her. Takahashi and Takumi are together when they find her lying in a field, where she’s been attacked by a wounded deer. Takumi suddenly turns on Takahashi and brutally strangles him, then grabs Hana’s body and runs. Takahashi gets up and stumbles across the field, then falls again and lies still.</p>
<p id="foTe67">Is Takahashi dead? Is Hana dead? Hamaguchi says he wants to leave those things up to interpretation, to invite people to discuss the ending and what it means. “In order to be able to make this happen, I think two things are necessary,” he told Polygon. “The first part is to end in this abrupt manner, almost leaving the audience behind. But that in itself, I don’t think is enough to create conversations and create different interpretations. It really relies on what the characters do up until that point.”</p>

<p id="40Y8OT">To some degree, the end of the film is foreshadowed in something Takumi tells his city visitors during the film: Deer aren’t ordinarily dangerous to humans, but a gutshot deer will lash out violently, particularly to protect its young. This is what happened to Hana: In what appears to be either a flashback or Takumi’s quick mental reconstruction when he sees her lying in the field, we see that she encountered a pair of deer, one of which had been shot. She attempted to approach them, and the wounded deer attacked her.</p>
<p id="7ZTZy0">In the same way, Takumi is symbolically a “gutshot deer.” He’s metaphorically wounded, both by the imminent destruction of his community and the natural world around him by predatory outsiders, and by the hurt done to his daughter, in part because of his own neglect. As we learn early in the movie, Takumi was sometimes a unreliable father: Hana is only out in the woods alone because she’s taken to walking home from school by herself, since he didn’t always remember to pick her up from school. Like the deer, Takumi lashes out irrationally, not at the source of his pain, but at the nearest available target.</p>
<p id="2n3KyN">“I do think he’s acting out of desperation,” Hamaguchi says. “In that moment, I think he does realize in [seeing Hana’s body] that he’s not able to be the kind of father he maybe wanted to be. And I think there are certain clues within the film where we see that.”</p>
<p id="SgtsXn">While Takumi’s behavior may seem extreme and difficult to understand, Hamaguchi hopes viewers will go back and watch the movie again, and see how his response fits in with other behavior we’ve seen from him.</p>
<p id="ezUQB1">“What I hope I’m achieving is that people feel that each character that appears in the film all have their own individual lives,” he says. “The way they act and what we see in the film are just moments that the cameras happened to capture, of life they each live outside of the film. And once people can feel that these characters actually do exist, then when we see them do something that is not quite understandable, the audience can still feel it’s still possible that they <em>could</em> do these things.”</p>
<p id="mLtjNT">He considers the movie’s ending an invitation to analyze and sit with the story: “When this kind of ending happens, I feel it causes the audience to reflect back on what they experienced before that, to rethink what they just watched, and to reflect upon whether their worldview of what they just saw is in was in fact correct,” he says. “That effect to me is a very interesting way to experience a film, and can result in a lot of interpretations. And so if that’s what it is doing, then I’m very grateful.”</p>
<h2 id="I08gpN"><strong>Why would Takumi respond to grief by trying to murder a near-stranger?</strong></h2>

<p id="SsOU3R">In terms of understanding Takumi’s attack, Hamaguchi suggests looking back at his 2018 movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l7uzLZBXLY"><em>Asako I &amp; II</em></a>, about a woman who falls for two physically identical men (played by the same actor) with radically different personas, and has to decide which one to stay with. “In that, a protagonist also makes choices,” Hamaguchi says. “And I think from the perspective of the wider society in which she lives, perhaps the choice she makes can be viewed as a bad choice. But I think from her perspective, it was the only choice she could make.”</p>
<p id="qk70mP">He says the decision helps Asako see herself more clearly, and learn more about what she values. “It’s my perspective of living and the worldview that I have in some ways,” he says. “I think there are moments in our lives where we suddenly understand something about ourselves through the choices we just made.”</p>
<p id="fR1JXF">Similarly, Hamaguchi says that when Takumi sees Hana lying in the field, he understands where his own choices have led. “I think in that moment, he realizes through the failures he has had,” he says. “That leads him to try to figure out desperately about what to do. That action might be read as absurd from the surroundings, or from people around him. But I think to me, this choice that he makes is something that for this particular character, could happen.”</p>
<p id="EjDraW">Put another way: Takumi has been a passive, quiet character throughout the process of the development plan, to the point where Takahashi and Mayuzumi try to hire him as a liaison with the community, a manager for the site who could also quell local tensions. In attacking Takahashi, he’s violently pushing back against the idea that he could be drawn to take their side against his community’s. He’s also defending his territory from outsiders, as a wild animal might. And like a wild animal, he’s acting without thinking about the consequences, or even about whether that action might plausibly achieve his goals. But that’s just one interpretation. </p>

<p id="A0s1x9"><em>Evil Does Not Exist </em>was <a href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2023/8/1/02j6ly234psb45yl5pyexs8ee9724d">originally planned</a> as a wordless 30-minute short film, a visual accompaniment for new music by Eiko Ishibashi, who also composed the score for <em>Drive My Car</em>. But Hamaguchi says her music and his location scouting inspired the story of the film — and the title came before that story was locked down. </p>
<p id="EuV0hC">“Before writing the script, when I was thinking about what I could shoot, I went out to where Eiko Ishibashi makes her music,” he says. “She makes her music amongst this very rich natural landscape. It was winter when I was there, and when I looked out into the winter landscape, these words popped up. I thought, <em>OK, it’s very cold right now. Standing here, I feel like I’m going to freeze to death. And yet it’s not that I feel any evil intentions here.</em>”</p>
<p id="fox68M">Hamaguchi says part of that insight<em> </em>came from living in an urban environment, where it’s rare to be far away from other people. The isolated community in <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> lives far away from that kind of constant engagement, and the people in that community are often alone in nature — which can be a dangerous environment, but not a purposefully or consciously inimical one. As the film’s story developed, Hamaguchi added characters that do live in urban environments, and do act in deliberately harmful ways, but he kept the title throughout. “Looking back at the film that we had made,” he says, “it made me think that watching this particular film against this title is probably an interesting experience together.”</p>
<p id="DMWlpX">But doesn’t the developer bringing chaos to a community for profit act in an evil way? “I think it’s actually a very difficult question to answer properly,” Hamaguchi says. “Say for now, we say that there is no evil in nature. Then the question becomes, <em>Is human society not natural? </em>I think we can say humans are a part of nature. But I think what’s also true about humans is that there might be more choices available.</p>
<p id="ysEjkc">“We can reflect back on our choices and say, <em>I should have chosen this way</em> or <em>I should have chosen this or that</em>, and sometimes make these decisions of whether those are good or bad choices. As human beings, when we’re living our lives, sometimes we think something is bad, or something was a bad choice. But when you interpret this as desire, I think you can also see that was part of nature as well. This is just how I honestly feel at the current moment.”</p>

<p id="SdzUiF">While the opening of <em>Evil Does Not Exist </em>doesn’t seem like it’d offer much inside on the ending, it actually ties directly into Hamaguchi’s point about perspective, understanding, and the natural world. </p>
<p id="MLjdMN">“That particular perspective that we see at the beginning is a perspective that only a camera can manage to capture,” he says. “Because as human beings, even if you look up and keep looking, it’s not possible to have your point of axis not moving, the way it does within that tracking shot. To be seeing that, with [the camera moving at] a very steady speed […] this vision is not necessarily a vision humans can have. </p>
<p id="kswtsG">“And I think through watching through this perspective, this vision for four minutes, my hope was that the people who are looking can acquire a slightly different way of perceiving, or a different way of thinking. Perhaps it’s closer to how a machine sees, or perhaps how nature sees. This is something that I wouldn’t know. But I think the fact that we, the audience, can acquire a different way of looking, perhaps, can lead the audience into understanding the rest of the film in a deeper level. And that’s why I wanted to start the film in that way.”</p>

The pitch is enticing: in the aftermath of an art heist, players bicker and fight over splitting the loot. This conflict is resolved through card play. You alternate taking turns by playing a single card, with these cards mapping to loot tokens in the center of the table. By playing a card you snatch the corresponding token and place it in front of you. The twist is that you can steal a token from another player instead of taking it from the middle. The second twist is that some of the lower scoring tokens offer alibis. At the end of the game, the player with the fewest amount of alibis is eliminated from play, regardless of their final score. The result is an entertaining back and forth where you gank loot from others yet must balance high scoring options with those that offer protection.</p><h2>Trio</h2><div id="200974"><p><h3>Trio</h3></p></div><p>Everyone is familiar with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classic board games</a> Go Fish and Memory. Trio splices the two, asking players to flip over three cards of the same number. These cards are facedown on the table, but some are also spread among the hands of the players. When flipping a card from a player’s hand, however, you can only ask them to reveal their highest or lowest card. The goal is to claim three of these trios or just the set of sevens. It’s a simple thing, but it’s one that elicits little moments of drama where a player has flipped two of the same number and is trying to remember where the third card is. It features hand management and surprisingly clever play. </p><h2>Love Letter</h2><div id="198214"><p><h3>Love Letter</h3></p></div><p>When Love Letter hit the market in 2012 it created quite the stir. This little 16-card game has players holding and playing only a single card on their turn. It’s maddeningly simple, but it works, capturing a degree of bluffing and risk management. Love Letter is fun and flexible, but it’s particularly noteworthy as it kicked off the microgame movement that spawned dozens and dozens of offspring. Most of those titles have long since faded, while Love Letter remains a clever and engaging experience. There are now a bevy of different versions of this game, including a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdnqm" target="_blank">Batman</a>, and wedding-themed set. They all play similarly, so you can’t go wrong whichever you choose.</p><h2>Radlands</h2><div id="155159"><p><h3>Radlands</h3></p></div><p>Radlands is one of the best head-to-head card games in recent years. Each player draws from a shared deck of mutants, raiders, and weirdos, playing these fighters down into one of three lanes on their side of the table. Each lane corresponds to a base that must be protected. The goal is to vanquish your opponent’s defenders and destroy their bases. The magic is in the multi-use aspect of each card. Beyond using them for the characters depicted, they can also be discarded for a card-specific resource. Performing well requires strong tactical intuition and judicious play you'd use in all the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">best strategy board games</a>. All of the interlocking abilities and effects collide to produce a swift-playing and tense battler.   </p><h2>Friday</h2><div id="200975"><p><h3>Friday: A Solo Adventure</h3></p></div><p>This small box is unique in that it’s for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> play only. This card game is based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. You take on the role of his companion Friday, attempting to help Robinson survive and prepare him for the impending pirate attack. This is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deckbuilding game</a> where you add cards to your deck during play. Each turn you confront a jungle hazard and then play fight cards from your hand in order to overcome the challenge. If you do, the hazard is then added to your deck and may be used in a later fight. You must pick your battles wisely, as you can’t win them all and must be careful in how you shape your deck for the big finale. This is a difficult game that offers a tremendous amount of play and strategic depth. </p><h2>For Sale</h2><div id="165423"><p><h3>For Sale</h3></p></div><p>For Sale crams the buying and selling of real estate into a brief yet satisfying 30 minutes. In the first phase of the game, players bid on a set of buildings by using a limited pool of personal currency. You must bid higher than all previous bids on each of your turns, or bow out of the round and claim the lowest value property available. Determining how long to hang in the auction depends on the value of the property on offer, as well as how stubborn your opponents are. The second portion of the game reverses the process with money cards worth various amounts flipped faceup in the middle of the table. Players secretly select a property they’ve purchased from their hand in an attempt to secure these monetary bids. You all reveal simultaneously and the money is split. It’s an exceedingly easy game to learn, but it’s one full of subtle play that relies on intuition. It’s paramount to squeeze every ounce of value out of your resources, and the player who manages their assets most judiciously will secure victory.  </p><h2>That’s Not a Hat</h2><div id="197491"><p><h3>That's Not a Hat</h3></p></div><p>This is the type of game that is both maddening and hilarious. Each player is dealt a card that sits out in front of them faceup. Cards depict simple objects with black and white line art. These are common things such as a basketball, lava lamp, or a hat. Once play begins, players take turns flipping their card facedown and passing it to an adjacent player. Soon, all cards are hidden and players are trying to track which is which. When you pass a card to a neighbor, you claim what the object is. The receiver of the card may challenge your claim, creating a confrontation of memory. It’s simple but sparks moments of laughter as it’s surprisingly easy to lose track of what card sits in front of you. Eventually someone messes up and the game begins again. This is a wonderful design that consistently delivers joy. </p><h2>Regicide</h2><div id="200976"><p><h3>Regicide: A Challenging Cooperative Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Regicide is a fully <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> where players work together to overthrow the royal line and claim victory. Each of the 12 enemies must be dealt with one at a time. These bosses map to the face cards in a standard set of playing cards. They are shuffled together and one is revealed. Players then take turns placing a single card on the table to attack the enemy and deal damage. The value on the played card is the strength of the attack with the suit triggering a special power. There’s a fairly thoughtful decision point here in weighing the needed attack versus the desired effect that would most help the other players. It’s a fairly intuitive card game where hand management and timing is everything. The strongest trait is that it’s full of tension as the group is constantly on the brink of defeat. Often, it will appear hopeless until another player tosses out the exact card the group needs, allowing everyone to refill their hands and persist. Regicide is an intriguing experience with a distinct feel. It’s a wonderful little pocket game. </p><h2>The Mind</h2><div id="157808"><p><h3>The Mind</h3></p></div><p>The Mind is a special game. Players are dealt a hand from a deck of cards numbered 1 to 100, with a portion of the cards left out and unknown. Play then flows in real-time. The player with the lowest card in hand must play it on the table. Then the next lowest card must be played atop the previous, and so on. The enormous twist is that players cannot communicate. You can’t talk or nod or gesture. You can just look into each other’s eyes and try to divine the proper time to play your card. It sounds ridiculous, but I assure you, there is a game here. It’s about pausing and feeling out the situation, eventually playing the proper card when it feels like enough time has passed. If approached with the right attitude it can brush up against a metaphysical element, achieving a playstate with similar vibes to a Ouija board. This may not have universal appeal, but it’s a game that presents a singular vision that is capable of achieving transcendent entertainment. </p><h2>Werewords</h2><div id="200977"><p><h3>Werewords: The Hidden Identity Word Game</h3></p></div><p>This small box is basically the classic 20 Questions with the inclusion of a traitor. One player receives a word they must get the group to guess, and everyone else is allowed to only throw out “yes or no” questions. At least one person in the group is a werewolf trying to trip up the villagers. They know the word before play begins and can attempt to mislead or stall the group. If everyone fails to figure out the correct word, however, they get to vote as a group to hang a player they suspect to be the werewolf. If they select the villain, the villagers win regardless of failing to land on the proper word. This strongly mimics the structure of social deduction games such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/weAZR" target="_blank">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Od41j" target="_blank">The Resistance: Avalon</a>, but it allows for a more simple and streamlined process with a broadly enjoyable classic game at its core. It’s frankly surprising how effective this concoction is, but it manages to offer inspired play with all kinds of players and tastes. This is one of the most reliably fun pocket-sized games ever designed. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Bile Titan is akin to the general of the Terminid army in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s a massive beast, towering over everything on four tall legs. There are multiple ways to kill the Bile Titan in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, one of which is quick. Sometimes.</p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best way to kill a Bile Titan in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is by turning it to mulch with a powerful Secondary Weapon or Stratagem</strong>. Weapons like the EAT-17 and Quasar Cannon do a ton of damage to the hulking monstrosity, especially if you aim at its head — the Bile Titan’s primary weak point. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-kill-a-bile-titan-in-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">How to kill a Bile Titan in <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">It’s up for debate how much damage a Bile Titan must take before toppling over like a stack of lawn chairs. A couple of shots to the face with an EAT can do it, but the bug may need more before you can convince it to give up the ghost. No, you can’t fire away with the Railgun until its head explodes — not anymore, that is.</p>
 <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">As far as Stratagems go, the Bile Titan isn’t a fan of the Eagle 500kg Bomb or the Orbital Railgun. The latter is a better idea if you want to go for the kill shot, but keep in mind that the Titan may shrug off the first slug. Yes, it’s a bit inconsistent. My favorite methods are the 500kg Bomb and the Orbital Laser. Keep in mind that the bomb beacon must be dropped in the Bile Titan’s path. You can be smart about it, though.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">The best method to kill a Bile Titan with an Eagle 500kg Bomb:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"> <li>Get the Bile Titan’s attention by shooting it or entering its view</li> <li>Allow the Titan to get close and prepare a bile spew</li> <li>As it begins the above, drop the beacon under the Titan and run</li> </ul>

For the Titan, the soft, green belly is a smart target for you and your team to take advantage of, and here’s why. </p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Bile Titan has two attacks based on distance</strong>. When close, the Bile Titan will stomp on you with its massive legs. If you’re out of reach, it spews a jet stream of green bile that can kill you in seconds. That’s why you’ll want to target its belly to stop it from firing acid.</p>
 <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false"><strong>Use medium and heavy weapons to inflict damage to its abdomen</strong>. After a while, you can destroy its belly and the Bile Titan will lose its ability to spew acid.</p> <figure data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

Try it as well as the Quasar Cannon, as they dish out the most damage quickly and reliably.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>The sleeper hit from this list may be the Arc Thrower</strong>. It penetrates armor and can be fired from a considerable distance. The only drawback is that it can result in friendly-fire killings or prioritize smaller fries beneath it. You’d only want to use this weapon if the Bile Titan is by itself.</p> <p data-characters="11" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false"><strong>Do <em>not </em>use:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true"> <li>Flamethrower</li> <li>Incendiary Grenade</li> <li>Stun Grenade</li> </ul>

 <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="141" data-injectable="false">Other Stratagems that aren’t listed here have reportedly worked for other players, but the ones here have been more consistent overall.</p> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false"><strong>You can also take down a Bile Titan using a sentry and some good planning</strong>. A Rocket or Autocannon sentry both do work against the beast, but you’ll need to drop them well outside of its acid range. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">The Exosuit mech is equipped with a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher. <strong>Three to four blasts with its rockets can take down a Bile Titan with ease</strong>.

Body shots don’t seem to faze it, meaning your only shot to take it down during a drop is by clipping it in the head. It’s a lot to ask from a human cannonball.</p> <figure data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/divinity-original-sin-board-game-expansions-showcase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, the sheer volume of content and replayability in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/divinity-original-sin-board-game-review"><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em></a> core set wasn't enough for you? You want more? Well, luckily enough, Larian Studios produced a lot more content out of their Kickstarter, and in this article, we'll take a look at each and see what it adds to your games. We'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, so we won't post full images of the box contents in case it spoils anything from the Core Set for you.</p>

<p>If you want to hear all about the <em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game,</em> you can check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/divinity-original-sin-board-game-review">here</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-2.jpg?itok=z2gQfYGP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-2.jpg?itok=wu4fKdVu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Miniatures Upgrade Set Part 1</h2>

<p>The main box for&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>included miniatures for the 10 available characters for the players, but the bosses and minions you faced were card standees that linked to the stat cards.</p>

<p>With the Miniatures Upgrade Set 1, it brings your boss battles to life by adding in 9 miniatures for the bosses you might meet during your adventures, along with several miniatures for summons and other effects you can put into play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The miniature for the summons and other effects are very handy, and help with the immersion as it makes their location obvious (there can be a lot going on in the Divine Atlas during games), but the other miniatures are only for bosses that you might not meet during your playthrough. When they do hit the table though, the miniatures are a lot more impressive than a card standee and really help with getting into the game. It's a lot scarier being in the same location as a boss when they have a miniature.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-3.jpg?itok=rT-s4CYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-3.jpg?itok=V__vfnXh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Miniatures Upgrade Set Part 2</h2>

<p>The second Miniatures Upgrade Set adds in the final 6 miniatures for the available bosses and a bonus miniature for an NPC that you might meet.</p>

<p>As with the first set, the miniatures are only for bosses that you might not meet during your playthrough, so they won't always be in use, and may not come up during your playthrough. While these boss miniatures are a lot small than those in the Part 1 set, they're no less impressive and really help with the immersion.</p>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>Nightmare Dungeon adds two brand new modes to the game. Dungeon Mode, which takes away the story from the game and turns it into a battler challenge.</p>

<p>The expansion includes a set of cards that tell you which location to use, and a way to generate random enemies at your level (sometimes bosses) that you fight through and gain rewards. Nightmare Mode includes a set of cards that make the minions and bosses you face more challenging (and can also be used in conjunction with Dungeon Mode).</p>

<p>Nightmare Dungeon is a solid way to add an extra dimension to&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game,</em>&nbsp;and also a great way to play a filler game if a member of your gaming group can't make the regular night that you want to progress the story.</p>

<p>I'll always prefer the story mode, trying to find new story paths and secrets in the game, but if you just want to test your character and battle it out against a series of enemies, then Nightmare Dungeon does just that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-5.jpg?itok=BBKW63a4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-5.jpg?itok=NYIap-gn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Nemesis Expansion</h2>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>Nemesis adds new items, a new skill school, and extends the core campaign, along with a new boss and minions to face as part of it.</p>

<p>The new items can be used regardless, and can just be shuffled into the core items, but it order to use the Demonology skill cards, one party member has to sign the Demonic Contract at the start of the game, which then means you can access the expansion and boss at the end of the core game. The set includes the miniature for Nemesis, all the boss components, and 3 new double-sided location boards and cards for it.</p>

<p>Nemesis is my favorite expansion for&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game.</em>&nbsp;The Demonology Skill school would be enough for me, but the extra campaign and boss are also extremely enjoyable to play through.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-6.jpg?itok=QiW4sGsx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-6.jpg?itok=6sVWegSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Haunted Keep Expansion</h2>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>Haunted Keep adds new items and a side quest to the campaign. As with Nemesis, the items can be shuffled into the core items at the start of the game, even if you're not using the Haunted Keep.</p>

<p>The Haunted Keep becomes available as you progress through the main quest, and then returns you to the main quests after it's completion. It contains 3 double-sided location boards and a boss and minions to face and a new environmental effect to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>The Haunted Keep expansion is fun to play through, adding a new dimension from the core set, with some awesome new items, that come at a cost to own them.</p>

<p>The <em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> box is huge, which will make <em>Gloomhaven</em> players feel at home, but may be overwhelming to anyone else. Players shouldn't judge the size of the box to the complexity of the game though and it is simply an indication of the amount of content you get.</p>

<p>Larian has also designed this huge box extremely well, and the components for your first game, the Tutorial - Torture Chamber, are cleverly placed at the top of the box, all players need to do is gather the components listed on the first game leaflet, and read the first few pages of the rulebook.</p>

<p>Each session of&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>is played on the Divine Atlas, a book of maps that contains game information, and the different locations for that session. Each map has the unique rules for that area, and a series of linked locations that players can explore each turn.</p>

<p>If there are no enemies visible, then players can explore freely, traveling to locations and revealing cards that have that location's details on. Some locations offer interactions, challenges, information, loot, or reveal enemies that immediately turn the game into combat rounds until no enemies are visible again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=Ue5mW-4Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=otH1SpKr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some simple yet effective skill card combos in&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game.</em>&nbsp; Add wet to an area to make Electirc Dischange and area of effect weapon, or gain invisible to really ramp up the damage on Throwing Knife.</figcaption></figure><p>While in explore or combat rounds, a timer is tracked on the side of the game board. When the timer reaches certain points, events occur that move the story on or can throw the players into combat. When enemies activate, a targeting die is rolled.</p>

<p>The result of the die means they will either target the closest player, or follow their targeting rule, like the player with the highest or lowest health, armor, or a space with the most players in it.</p>

<p>The game also features a number of bosses that the players may encounter. Each boss comes with their own page in the Boss booklet, and their own set of action cards to make them much more challenging than the normal enemies the players may face.</p>

<p>During the player's turns, they get a number of action points that they can use to spend on attacking with equipment they hold or using skill cards from their hand.</p>

<p>Skill cards have a range of effects, depending on what you choose during character creation, and can be offensive, like Tentacle Lash, which is an attack card that can blind your target, and deals extra damage if they're already blinded, or defensive like Defensive Stance, which lets you reroll 1 of your attackers dice, or ignore 1 if you have a shield equipped.</p>

<p>Once used, skill cards go into a cooldown track which means they can't be used again until they're back in your hand, but this clever mechanic also tracks the use of some cards, which are placed face up in the cooldown track, like Cloak and Dagger, which while it is faceup, and you are invisible, allows you can reroll 1 attack dice.</p>

The special symbols activate effects listed on skill cards or other cards you may have in play, and hits deal damage according to the skill or equipment card used. The game comes with 3 types of custom dice:</p>

<ul><li>White, the basic dice</li>
	<li>Blue, which have more special symbols</li>
	<li>Red, which have more hits</li>
</ul><p>The game is controlled by timer-activated location cards, or by the exploration cards that players interact with. Once a card tells the players to progress to the next area, the board is cleared, and the page is turned to the indicated location to start the next session.</p>

<p>In between each session, players may have the option to level up their characters where they gain base stats, earn new talents, and skill cards, heal wounds, revive downed party members, or visit the merchant to buy new equipment.</p>

<h2>Does Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game Have Multiple Story Options?</h2>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> has all the story options! The Divine Atlas has 48 pages (not all scenario maps), and you won't hit all the pages in your playthrough, in fact, you might only see a quarter of them depending on your choices. Speaking to Larian at a demo night, this is not only for replayability but also so that your choices are meaningful. They wanted your decisions to actually have results based on the choices you make, not just a narrative way of getting you to the same map pages regardless of your actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=pLWUtcp9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=ooSO7i4A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>includes 10 playable characters and their associated miniatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Can You Play In Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game?</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>tutorial has 4 characters to play, and after that there are 10 characters to chose from (including the 4 from the tutorial). The available characters are:</p>

<ul><li>The Red Prince - An exiled prince, disgraced for cavorting with demons. They start with the Noble and Scholar keywords and are&nbsp;immune to fire damage.</li>
	<li>Sebille - Once previously controlled by magic to kill their own kind, now broken free and seeking vengeance on those that would control others. They have&nbsp;the Outlaw, Rogue, and Corpse Eater keywords, and gain a new skill whenever they defeat a boss.</li>
	<li>Lohse - A haunted performer who suffers from violent episodes. Begins with the Mystic and Rogue keywords, and they or a nearby ally can reroll 1 dice once per round.</li>
	<li>Beast - A banished dwarven usurper. Has the&nbsp;Barbarian and Noble keywords, and a higher starting max health than the others.</li>
	<li>Fane - Was imprisoned in a crypt for eons, and has awoken to find they are the last of their kind. Has&nbsp;the Mystic and Scholar keywords, they can return a facedown skill card to their hand the first time they defeat an enemy each round.</li>
	<li>Vali - Having already traded their mortality for undeath, they now seek to become even more powerful. They have the Culstist and Scholar keywords and start the game with an extra source (which can be spent to reroll&nbsp;once per&nbsp;scenario).</li>
	<li>Farzanah - Having fused themselves with the essence of the Dragon Knights, they now seek to prove themselves worthy. They have the Mystic and Culstist keyword and can move to an adjacent space once per round at no cost.</li>
	<li>Ifan - Having been used as a pawn to kill their own people, they now act as a mercenary, seeking vengeance on those who used them. They start with the Mercenary and Outlaw keywords and roll an extra blue dice when attacking a single target with an equipped item.</li>
	<li>Cassian - Once a Paladin of the Divine Order, now a seeker of justice against those who arranged the conspiracy that ruined their father. Has the Outlaw and Noble keywords, they can equip any 2&nbsp;hand items as 1&nbsp;item, and their physical armor is boosted when wielding 2 melee weapons.</li>
	<li>Tanguistal - A gladiator torn from their family. They have the Mercenary and Barbarian keywords and roll 3 red dice instead of white when making challenge rolls.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=B3GfMscC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=iVAABs21 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Tutorial set up for Sebille in&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game,</em> including a hand of 4 skill cards.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game Have Character Development?</h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>character has 6 levels to advance through on their stat cards, gaining health, action points, level bonuses, and source as they do. While you advance, your character also gains skill cards and talents, which are what drives your character's unique style.</p>

<p>There are 12 schools to chose skill cards from, and they each have 4 levels of cards. Level 1 and 2 can be chosen by any characters, and levels 3 and 4 can only be chosen if you have the talent that unlocks those cards. Each talent is unique, so the player who chooses that talent locks out the level 3 and 4 skill cards for other characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skill cards are designed to combo with other skill cards, building up status effects on your enemies (like bleeding and burning) and in locations (like charged and wet), and then capitalizing on them with other skill cards that add bonus when those effects are active.</p>

<p>So it's a good idea when you level up for the first time, to have a look through the talents and skill cards, and have an idea in mind of the balance amongst your party, and who will have which talents and skills cards, as those combination attacks can really help you at higher levels of enemies.</p>

<p>One thing we didn't talk about in our review was the random stuff that can happen while you're exploring the Divine Atlas, the items you can find that have an effect on another character you meet or a situation you end up in.</p>

<p>Aside from the great artwork, solid components (did we mention the sleek storage that the box insert is?), fantastic mechanics, the scope of the story, and sheer monumental variety of character development, it's these little moments that set it apart for me from other dungeon crawler type board games.</p>

<p>I won't spoil any of them for you, and you might not even come across any in your playthrough, but it's these little moments and details that make you realize that the focus really is on the choices you've made, and it's not simply an on-rails dungeon crawler.</p>



<p>If you're a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin </em>video games, then there's a lot to love here in its tabletop format. If it's your first ever tabletop game, then there is a lot to take in to start with, but the tutorial does a good job of getting you in and then adding in the rest of the rules after. For experienced tabletop gamers, the rules are well presented and while a lot of depth is offered, the rules aren't complex. If you've never played the video games, then the setting and game are fantastic, and you won't be disappointed.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a quick and easy pick-up game, then this isn't it. It's a hybrid between a full-blown tabletop roleplaying game and a dungeon crawler battler. While it doesn't have the full openness of an RPG, or the quick activation turn mechanics of some battler games, this finds a nice balance between the two, and allows a huge variety of character options, whilst keeping character development straightforward.</p>

<p>It does however take up a lot of table space. Once the Divine Atlas is set out, and the character and enemy boards are arranged, even without putting all the cards on the table, it still takes up most of a large dining table, so if you've only got a small place to play on, this car be awkward to set up and play.</p>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> works well with all player levels and is best enjoyed whilst working through the whole story as a group, so make sure all of your players are in for the full experience, in order to get the most out of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24162613/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-tampon-why-reason-item<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="c8wbv1"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24156442/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-steam-pc-nintendo-switch"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a><em> </em>stands out for a lot of reasons. It has deviously difficult puzzles and a distinct ambiance that appears to be inspired by noir filmmaking. You play as a woman named Lorelei who wanders around an extravagant hotel and solves its many mysteries. The game packs in loads of convoluted secrets, but that’s not actually what intrigued me while playing. The biggest enigma from my playthrough involved one unique item: a tampon. </p>
<p id="xlwJfO">Lorelei can store a variety of items in her elegant clamshell briefcase. When you start the game, you’ll find useful items like your car key and a tampon! Its inclusion stood out to me because tampons are such a common everyday item and yet they rarely appear in video games. I’ve been playing video games for decades and have encountered thousands of different items, but I only remember seeing tampons in one other game (that other example being the wonderful clutter-arranging game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22772131/unpacking-gamecube-retro-gaming-indie-game-pass"><em>Unpacking</em></a>).</p>
<p id="p6gPI7"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>was developed by Simogo, the same team behind the pop-infused racing game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/23/20880283/sayonara-wild-hearts-review-music"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a>. Polygon asked the studio’s co-founder, Simon Flesser, about why the team decided to add the item to the game. Flesser noted that common objects like tampons can help create a specific ambiance or feeling within the game. </p>
<p id="2DIYvU">“These everyday items and actions, like using the restroom and taking the elevator, are all there to establish a sense of mundanity, or normality,” Flesser told Polygon via email. “The more absurd and surreal components of the game feel even stranger when presented together with these ordinary elements.”</p>

<p id="kSv36q">As for the idea, it didn’t come out of any developer meeting, but at home. “It was suggested by my partner, who simply just asked why the woman does not carry tampons in her purse,” Flesser said. </p>
<p id="7Zclk6">Both my colleague Nicole Carpenter (who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24156442/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-steam-pc-nintendo-switch">reviewed</a> the game) and I had not been able to find a use for the tampon. As I’ve played, I’ve been content to try and stick the tampon in random holes and slots. This has not worked. However, this did make my co-worker and I wonder if the tampon <em>did </em>have any kind of practical application for a puzzle. As it turns out, the tampon isn’t some galaxy-brained solution to any of the game’s puzzles. As Flesser said, “It simply exists.” </p>

  <p id="npjSck">Finding the <strong>sea giant’s name</strong> in <em>Hellblade 2</em> requires you to solve another perspective-based rune puzzle. You’ll reach this part of Senua’s journey during chapter 5, “Bardarvik” (“Bárðarvík”) after you find the hiddenfolk. On your way to Bardarvik, you’ll have to fight some draugar, and then you’ll have to complete two rune puzzles before you can find Sjavarrisi the sea giant’s true name.</p>
<p id="BYpAba">To solve both of the puzzles, you’ll have to play with perspective to line up shapes in the landscape to recreate runes — just like you did back in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24160714/hellblade-2-draugar-settlement-rune-puzzle-solution">Freyslaug</a>.</p>
<p id="YHN8jO">Our <em>Hellblade 2</em> guide will show you <strong>how and where to find the runes</strong> in both of the Bardarvik puzzles.</p>

Categories include Destruction, Excitement, Competition, Community, Challenge, Strategy, Completion, Power, Fantasy, Story, Discovery, and Design.</p><p>Quantic Foundry looked back on what's motivated gamers across the years and found all of these have remained relatively consistent except one: Strategy. "Gamers who score high on this component enjoy games that require careful decision-making and planning," its summary states. "They like to think through their options and likely outcomes.</p><p>"These may be decisions related to balancing resources and competing goals, managing foreign diplomacy, or finding optimal long term strategies. They tend to enjoy both the tactical combat in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xcom-chimera-squad-review">XCOM</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-review">Fire Emblem</a>, as well as seeing their carefully devised plans come to fruition in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review">Civilization</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-review">Cities: Skylines</a>, or Europa Universalis."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/img-4108-1716395391389.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But across its 1.7 million surveys, Quantic Foundry found that two thirds of strategy fans worldwide (except China, where gamers "have a very different gaming motivation profile") have lost interest in this element of video games. "67% of gamers today care less about strategic thinking and planning when playing games than the average gamer back in June 2015," the report reads.</p><p>"When we looked for long-term trends across the 12 motivations, we found that many motivations were stable or experienced minor deviations over the past nine years," Quantic Foundry said. "Strategy was the clear exception; it had substantially declined over the past nine years and the magnitude of this change was more than twice the size of the next largest change."</p><p>The trend was analysed but Quantic Foundry couldn't find any distinct separations between, for example, men and women or gamers based in or out of the U.S. It was likened to other trends related to a decrease in attention span, like shorter YouTube videos now generating more views and shorter lengths of time between cuts in films, but Quantic Foundry admitted "it's difficult to pin down cause and effect" and said there's a lack of evidence to solely blame social media, as many do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"67% of gamers today care less about strategic thinking and planning when playing games.</p></div><p>The likes of Facebook, X/Twitter, TikTok, and other social media apps could have "accelerated the underlying trend", however. "Another potential hypothesis is that the increasing negativity, polarization, intrusiveness, and emotional manipulation in social media has created a persistent cognitive overload on the finite cognitive resources we have," Quantic Foundry said. "Put simply, we may be too worn out by social media to think deeply about things."</p><p>Regardless of the cause, Quantic Foundry said "it's clear that gamers have become less interested in strategic thinking over the past nine years," which "implies that gamers are now more easily cognitively overloaded when they play games and are more likely to avoid strategic complexity."</p><p>This trend may even affect how developers create and market games, though there are still plenty of strategy titles on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-at-tinybuild-connect-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The indie publisher tinyBuild recently premiered its tinyBuild Connect showcase, a 20-minute stream packed with announcements, trailers, and demos. If you weren’t able to watch it live or want a reminder of everything that was shown, IGN has you covered. Here are all the games that were featured during the show:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/level-zero-extraction-1715887348575.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Level Zero: Extraction</strong></h3><p>The upcoming multiplayer extraction horror where players can take on the role of human mercenaries or alien monsters dropped a short teaser hinting at a bigger announcement at the PC Gaming Show this June. IGN got a chance to play it, and you can read all about our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/level-zero-extraction-hands-on-preview-mixing-tarkov-and-alien-isolation-beautifully"><u>hands-on impressions</u></a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/sand-1715887403518.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Sand</strong></h3><p>The Connect gave us our first look at this PvPvE extraction shooter, announced last year with an atmospheric cinematic trailer. In Sand, players descend upon a desert planet recently devastated by a massive ecological disaster. Here, they will traverse the world riding giant mechanical walkers called Tramplers, take the fight to other scavengers both on foot and aboard their Tramplers, and explore cities in search of loot before extracting off planet. If you’re excited to jump into this world, tinyBuild announced the game’s first beta, which will launch this summer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/duckside-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Duckside</strong></h3><p>Don the feathers of a hat-wearing duck and fly into a persistent survival game with PVP, PVE, crafting, and base building. Shoot your fellow ducks out of the sky, blow up their carefully crafted bases, and keep them from doing the same to you. During the Connect, we learned that the recent beta had more than 150,000 players, but if you weren’t able to take part, good news. TinyBuild also announced a second open playtest on June 6, so you’ll have another chance to dive into the world of Duckside.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/kingmakers-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Kingmakers</strong></h3><p>Announced in February, Kingmakers is a mix of third-person shooter and RTS set in medieval Europe. And yes, the “third-person shooter” part is correct, because you play as a soldier who traveled back in time with a mission to alter history and save the future using modern weapons. The reveal clearly got the attention of gamers — the trailer has 11 million views across IGN’s social channels, making it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>the most watched game trailer on IGN’s socials</u></a> so far this year. The new video dropped by the devs showcases even more havoc to be wreaked once the game releases into Steam Early Access later this year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/drill-core-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Drill Core</strong></h3><p>The tinyBuild Connect gave us a new game reveal with Drill Core, a strategic colony sim. Drill to the heart of planets while allocating workers, researching cutting-edge tech, and fortify against nightly alien attacks. Will you choose the path of efficiency, risking the safety of your workers, or prioritize defense for survival? You can give the game a try with a brand-new playtest that is available now on Steam.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/the-king-is-watching-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>The King Is Watching</strong></h3><p>TinyBuild also revealed The King Is Watching, a kingdom-building rogue-lite with a micromanagement twist — the king’s servants only attend to their duties when he’s actually watching them. A Steam demo is available to play right now.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/rawmen-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Rawmen</strong></h3><p>Rawmen is a light-hearted, soup-slinging food fighter multiplayer arena shooter (that’s a mouthful — pun intended). You can whack the opposing team with mackerel, destroy them with dumplings, let loose with a sausage-shooting minigun, or tap into your souper chef ultimate ability. It’s coming to the Epic Games Store on July 23 and will be free to play.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/voin-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Voin</strong></h3><p>Voin is a fast-paced first-person hack-and-slash RPG inviting you to tear through hordes of enemies with fury and style. As we learned during the show, Voin has an updated demo available to play on Steam.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/astor-blade-of-the-monolith-1715887488980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Astor: Blade of the Monolith</strong></h3><p>In this fast-paced action RPG, you play as Astor, a young warrior determined to discover the secrets behind his creators’ unforeseen demise. You’ll have an arsenal of runic weapons to use as you hunt down evil through vibrant, colorful environments to save the magical planet. The release date for Astor: Blade of the Monolith is approaching fast — it releases May 30 on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/streets-of-rogue-2-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Streets of Rogue 2</strong></h3><p>This hotly anticipated sequel is a wild, immersive sandbox RPG set in a large, randomly generated world. Your goal is to topple a corrupt president and bring yourself to power, but how you do it is up to you. Fight, farm, build, sneak, steal, or hack your way to victory, solo or with friends. We got a teaser as part of the Connect, but there’s an even bigger reveal coming at PC Gaming Show on June 9, so stay tuned.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/train-valley-world-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Train Valley World</strong></h3><p>This third entry in the Train Valley series expands the scope, allowing you to build and manage intricate railroads across the globe, design your own levels, and become a business mogul — by yourself or with friends. We got a new trailer at the Connect that revealed an August release date, so get ready to be a train tycoon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/i-am-future-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>I Am Future</strong></h3><p>We’re getting a big content update for I Am Future, a single-player cozy survival game released into Steam Early Access last year, in which you play as a last survivor on Earth set to build a lush and comfy camp on a skyscraper rooftop. The new updates will add a gym-themed setting, a new weather system, quality-of-life improvements, and most importantly, cheese trees. We could all use a cheese tree.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/not-for-broadcast-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Not For Broadcast</strong></h3><p>It's difficult to find a game as unique as Not For Broadcast, the FMV propaganda simulator that is about to get the final DLC to conclude its story. It will bring back the full news team for the first time since 2020 and throw them into a time-bending mystery.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/punch-club-2-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Punch Club 2</strong></h3><p>The showcase also premiered a new Punch Club 2 DLC, called Iron Fist.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-explained.878652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With all the popularity of Ubisoft’s newly released online shooter <em>XDefiant</em>, a few error codes have started to pop up and have become commonplace throughout its early release. Three of the more common <em>XDefiant</em> error codes are Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot. Let’s take a look at what causes these error codes and what you can do to make them stop occurring.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-what-do-xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-mean" data-injectable="false">What do <em>XDefiant</em> Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes mean?</h2> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true">The <em>XDefiant</em> Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes indicate that there’s some sort of connection issue with <em>XDefiant</em>, though as of now it mostly pertains to server issues due to the game being overloaded with players trying to connect and play. Each of these three error codes seem to occur with a number 01-10 following them, though the number doesn’t seem to hold relevance.</p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">In fact, the Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes themselves seem to all mean the same thing. For example, you can get a Bravo-01 error code, then retry, and immediately after get say, the Foxtrot-05 error code. Despite the difference in error code name and number, the issue is exactly the same: a connection failed.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-fix-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-errors-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">How to fix Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot errors in <em>XDefiant</em></h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">In most instances, the only thing you can do if you receive the Bravo, Delta, or Foxtrot error in <em>XDefiant</em> is to try again. Typically you just were not able to connect to the servers, which at the moment is because they are very congested due to a high player account. You basically have to try again to see if you get lucky and get in, instead of getting the error message.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">However, if you continue to receive these error codes after the servers are no longer congested, there are a few connection-related troubleshooting methods you can try. Here are ways you can fix the Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes in <em>XDefiant</em>:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Restart your game.</strong> Sometimes you will have a version mismatch or simply have an unstable connection when launching. Restarting your game can fix both of these issues.</li> <li><strong>Double-check your internet connection</strong>. Make sure there is no outage with your ISP, and if you are on a wireless connection, switch to a wired one.</li> <li><strong>Verify your game files.</strong> It’s possible you have some corrupt data files, which you can fix by heading to the Ubisoft Connect launcher and clicking the three dots on <em>XDefiant</em> and then choosing Verify Files.</li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rolling-stone-which-used-to-have-a-gaming-vertical-launches-another-gaming-vertical.878649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Rolling Stone announced the launch of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/rolling-stone-launches-gaming-section-1235025173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone Gaming</a>, a vertical dedicated to “taking a serious (or deeply unserious) journalistic approach to telling the story of games through the people around them.” You might be thinking, haven’t we done this before? You would be correct.</p><p>Rolling Stone <em>had</em> a gaming site, Glixel, which ran for a bit over a year before <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/glixels-san-francisco-office-closed-team-laid-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down in 2017</a>. Rolling Stone Gaming’s announcement notes this in a roundabout way, with senior editor Christopher Cruz writing, “this isn’t entirely new, <em>Rolling Stone</em> has been covering games for years. But with the launch of our new section, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rs-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RS Gaming</a>, we’re committing to meeting the community at its own wavelength to tell stories that matter, even if you don’t consider yourself a gamer.”</p><p>Cruz writes that RS gaming is "about community, from the modders keeping beloved games alive after corporations pull the plug to the cosplayers doing themed karaoke after a mobile game meetup.”</p><p>Does that sound a little familiar? Well, when Glixel launched in 2016, general manager John Davison <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rolling-stone-publisher-launching-gaming-site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “We want to make it very much about the people - not just the people that make games, but the people that play them.”&nbsp;Hm!</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rolling-stone-launches-gaming-vertical-with-help-from-saudi-wealth-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a>, RS Gaming is a partnership with ESL FACEIT Group, though “the nature of the partnership… is unclear.” ESL is owned by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/savvy-gaming-group-purchases-esl-gaming-and-faceit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Savvy Games Group</a>, which Game Developer notes is funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, whose chairperson, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, has a<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/9/mohammed-bin-salman-the-dark-side-of-saudi-arabias-crown-prince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pretty shitty record</a> on human rights and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalism</a>. So this sure seems like the latest volley in the regime’s attempt to spiff up its image through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming</a>, an attempt that has also involved <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collapse of a deal between Savvy and Embracer</a>, which in turn led to Embracer’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruinous rampage</a> of layoffs and studio closures.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, Saudi Arabia still maintains minority investments in Nintendo, Take-Two, EA, Nexon, and Capcom, as well as Embracer. Last year, Savvy Games Group <a href="https://savvygames.com/savvy-games-group-completes-acquisition-of-scopely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired mobile developer Scopely</a> for $4.9 billion. In addition, it has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/29/saudi-arabia-invest-37-billion-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set aside $13 billion</a> "for the acquisition and development of a leading game publisher to become a strategic development partner." Saudi Arabia has also demonstrated a particular interest in esports, with companies like Riot rebuffing its advances (<a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/29558777/lec-ends-neom-partnership-following-staff-outrage?utm_source=www.jacobwolf.report&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=saudi-state-backed-esports-world-cup-to-host-league-of-legends-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after staff outcry</a>) in 2020, <a href="https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/saudi-statebacked-esports-world-cup-host-league-legends-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only to participate</a> in the Saudi-backed Esports World Cup this year. All of this on top of substantial Saudi ventures in the worlds of <a href="https://defector.com/tag/saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sports</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_International_Film_Festival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film</a>, and even <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/mma/news/major-update-wwe-future-with-saudi-arabia-before-king-queen-ring-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pro wrestling</a>.</p><p>This is also not the first time Rolling Stone has launched a gaming-adjacent venture since Glixel. In 2021, the publication rolled out its own Twitch channel as part of <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/twitch-partnerships-rolling-stone-complex-vice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a partnership with Twitch</a>. The channel and its hosts were generally well liked on the platform -- a notoriously tough nut for traditional media to crack -- but once the partnership ended, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1679166251493474314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so did the channel</a>. </p><p>On the back of yesterday’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad games journalism news</a>, part of me <em>really</em> wants to be excited to see a mainstream outlet investing in gaming, but… well, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/03/31/launcher-mission-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we know how these things go</a>. Here's hoping history doesn't repeat itself, or at least we get some good journalism out of it before it does.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the new film has a tendency to treat its namesake as the fulcrum around which a story is happening instead of someone participating in it, which is a shame considering how she’s the big draw.</p><p>Whereas previous <em>Mad Max </em>films have essentially been snapshots from a war-torn future, <em>Furiosa </em>chronicles the entire young adulthood of Furiosa (Alyla Browne in flashbacks and Anya Taylor-Joy closer to the present), one of the last people to know what it was like to grow up in the fabled Green Place of Many Mothers. Furiosa is just one of many kids able to truly thrive in the Green Place thanks to its natural abundance (read: fresh food and water) and relative seclusion within the treacherous Australian wasteland. But for all the safety Furiosa feels in her early years, she’s also keenly aware of how tenuous that security is. When her people are ultimately attacked by raiders, she knows the Green Place’s survival in secrecy hinges on the outsiders’ deaths.</p><p>By opening <em>Furiosa </em>in the Green Place and foregrounding it as the environment that first shaped Furiosa herself, Miller establishes early on how interested he is in using this film to illustrate the durability of ideas. As Furiosa’s snatched away from her idyllic home and enslaved by sadistic warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), the film spotlights how life in the wasteland can turn people into their most monstrous selves. But Furiosa’s memories of the Green Place, and its impact on how she sees the world, are part of what make her so well-suited to deal with the outside horrors.</p><p>Whereas <em>Fury Road </em>often<em> </em>felt like a gasoline and piss-soaked lucid dream punctuated with guitar riffs and the roar of flamethrowers, <em>Furiosa </em>unfolds much more like a stage play told in bookended acts that all crystalize how Furiosa became a warrior. Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris emphasize the importance of Furiosa’s perceptiveness as the film fleshes out the cast of weatherbeaten ghouls who serve Dementus. These include The History Man (George Shevtsov) and interpretive dance proclaimer Smeg (David Collins). Though none of Dementus’ goons can make sense of why the enslaved girl won’t speak, through them, she’s able to learn what it means to live among predatory strongmen who harness fear as a weapon.</p><p>It’s interesting to see more of <em>Max Max</em>’s dystopian world from the perspective of Dementus’ gang — a band of motorcycle-riding maniacs who frequently turn on one another both out of spite and necessity.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Furiosa can’t initially perceive it, there’s a distinct difference between the cultures of Dementus’ horde and that of the Citadel where Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme) rules his fanatic War Boys and enforcers like Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke). In Praetorian Jack, you can see shades of Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky, which brings a narrative poetry to the larger Furiosa story Miller has been telling with the franchise’s last two films. But from the moment Furiosa meets Dementus, you can almost immediately hear Miller and Lathouris struggling to lock in on what kind of presence they want their mad biker king to be.</p><p>Similar to Fury<em> Road</em>’s Immortan Joe before him, Dementus is another font of absurd masculinity whose cartoonish effects contrast with his bloodlust and penchant for torture. Through a face full of prosthetics that distract more than transform, Hemsworth tries to bring Dementus to life with an energy that’s meant to read as unhinged but tends to play as scatterbrained. You can see the spark of a complicated altruism in the paternal shine he takes to Browne’s haunted, adolescent Furisosa toward the beginning of the movie. But as the film brings the Biker Horde and the War Boys together in a prolonged power struggle, Dementus starts to feel more like a character stitched together from leftover ideas for Immortan Joe that didn’t make it into <em>Fury Road</em> or the 2015 <em>Mad Max </em>video game.</p><p>That feeling of Dementus being an echo of <em>Mad Max </em>villains past intensifies as the younger Immortan Joe — a more level-headed, cautious version of his <em>Fury Road </em>self — becomes a bigger part of <em>Furiosa</em>. The characters’ similarities feel like two expressions of what kind of archetypal tyrant would crave and attract power in the wake of society’s collapse. They’re both macabre brutes whose rages frequently seem to mask deep-seated insecurities about their places in the world. But <em>Furiosa</em>’s characterization of Immortan Joe and his mutilated failsons Scrotus (Josh Helman) and Erectus (Nathan Jones) does so much more to make the movie feel like an organic extension of <em>Fury Road</em> rather than a fancy new limb grafted on in response to the earlier film’s success.</p><p>Immortan Joe and his War Boys are also an important part of how <em>Furiosa</em> brings Taylor-Joy’s Imperator-to-be into the picture. And while the older Furiosa continues to say so little that she often feels like the latest example of the silent / deadly girl trope, she also becomes the focal point of some of the movie’s most impressive set pieces. <em>Furiosa</em>’s action sequences — chases through the desert and battles in places like the oil-rich Gas Town — all feel smaller in comparison to <em>Fury Road </em>in a way that actually helps the film establish its own identity.&nbsp;</p><p>The sequences’ scale and the way shots of explicit carnage are obfuscated by clouds of smoke and sand almost make it seem as if Miller’s reminding you how much more dire things become for Furiosa in the future. But the steely-eyed determination with which Taylor-Joy’s Furiosa moves through the film’s last third is mesmerizing — at least in moments when the movie just lets her be the star rather than the person who’s forced to step up when the men around her can’t quite get the job done.&nbsp;</p><p>For all of Taylor-Joy’s ability to command attention when she’s on-screen, <em>Furiosa </em>still makes its heroine feel like a supporting character in her own movie. This happens essentially right up until its final act, which comes closer to <em>Fury Road</em> than you might expect. And while the two films connect in a way that makes them work as a double feature, watching them back-to-back highlights just how much more the 2015 film gave Furiosa to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="NjYYdQ">The job of raising a hero destined to save the world is an underrated role. In video games, many of our RPG heroes come to us as fully grown adults who are old enough to handle being whatever kind of hero they need to be for the game they’re in. We don’t need to worry about bathing them, making sure they don’t poop themselves, or raising them in the right way so that they can have the right powers for whatever class of fighter they grow up to be. To be honest, I never considered the early years of the hero. That is, until I played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/"><em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em></a>.</p>
<p id="SZ3Vop">Developed by the small studio 14 Hours Productions and published by Astrolabe Games, <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> starts with a fairy. She lays an egg (in front of you) and tells you that she doesn’t want to raise it (rude!). She then gives you the egg and says that it’s up to you to raise the creature so that it can grow up to be a hero who saves the land of Faria from the Frog Lord. Thus began the biggest adventure of them all: parenthood. I named my character Beadle (like the scrawny salesman Beedle from The Legend of Zelda games), because I didn’t know what would emerge from the egg. After a brief few minutes of tending to the egg and playing a simple minigame where I protected it from the elements, a whole-ass human baby hatched from the egg — Beadle was a girl!</p>
<p id="C7Yu8p"><em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> contains all the trappings of your typical pet sim <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24145363/stardew-valley-like-idle-farming-sim-rustys-retirement">and idle game</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777555/tamagotchi-uni-killed-wore-wedding">like a Tamagotchi</a> — but then adds a whole bunch of other stuff onto that framework. On the most basic level you can tend to your Yolk Hero at the guild where they live. There, you manage your future hero’s four different status bars — energy, hunger, hygiene, and bladder — by taking actions like bathing them or sending them to use the toilet. Each task takes a set amount of time unless you decide to help your Yolk Hero by playing a simple mini game. So Beadle might take a minute and half to poop by herself, but I can shorten the amount of time it takes and lessen her constipation by button smashing my mouse. </p>

<p id="G09sd1">The game gets more complicated when it comes to the “heroes” part of it all. I can send Beadle on little adventures where she’ll fight a series of enemies with short walking breaks in between. A quest might take 30 minutes to complete, but I can step in to allow Beadle to complete the quest much more quickly by helping her fight. These quests introduce systems with a surprising amount of depth: Area 1 contains 12 different quests, during which you can level up your Yolk Hero. Player characters even develop specific skills for different classes like Monk, Ninja, Paladin, and so on. Beadle grew up to be a Samurai, which I didn’t pick but might have been influenced by the training I had her do in her child stage, so I would buy items and upgrades specifically tailored for her class to maximize her odds of success.</p>
<p id="z9WKOX">Turns out I am a bit of a helicopter parent, so I’ve been watching her fight a goose wearing a kimono to the left of my browser as I write this. If I see she’s having a tough time with a fight, I click over and give her a little boost to make sure she stays safe. That might make this game sound a bit demanding, but the greatest part of <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> is that I feel like I can put as much or as little time into it as I’d like.</p>
<p id="pu8szC">I still have memories of rushing off to the bathroom to feed my needy Tamagotchi as a child, but I don’t deal with that in <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em>. I am taking care of a budding hero. She might not be the most powerful warrior in the land, but she’s not so helpless that I need to be checking in on her all the time. </p>
<p id="nxGBRe">What’s more is that the game has settings that allow you to decide details of gameplay like whether or not you want the game to continue to run in the background when you close it or not. So if you want to turn off care for your character for the weekend when you’re away from your desk, you can. Similarly along those lines, features like the task queue allow you to line up a to-do list for your Yolk Hero. So when I left for dinner last night, I set up a little evening routine for her so she would come back with her status bars in good shape. </p>

<p id="8EATfi">Each time I log off, I feel a small pang of anxiety: Will my Yolk Hero be okay? What if she dies on her quest? I worry about my poor Beadle — but never for too long. </p>
<p id="xvBcNd">Again, that’s because <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> is an idle game that gives you a good amount of flexibility as to how much time you actually spend playing. If you want to get really into adventuring and help your Yolk Hero fight and explore, you can. If you just want to watch them bop around on the side of the screen as you work, that’s also possible. Or if you have moments where it’s just too much, you can just close the game entirely and allow your hero to work through their challenges themselves. </p>
<p id="DQlqSh">The joy of parenthood — at least, as it’s represented in the sweet little microcosm of this game — is about seeing growth, but also knowing when it’s okay to step away and let your child surprise you. </p>

<p data-characters="137" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Battle royales dominate the first-person shooter genre, so some fans expect <em>XDefiant</em> to bite the bullet and follow the rest of the herd. </p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">In 2017, <em>H1Z1 </em>sparked what would become a meteoric rise in battle royale popularity. <em>Fortnite </em>eventually took over that mantle, and then other studios entered the fray and put their unique spin on the genre to varying degrees of success. Seven years later, there is still a demand for more innovations to the tried-and-true formula, including calls for<em> XDefiant</em> to join in. </p> <h2 id="h-will-xdefiant-have-a-battle-royale-mode" data-injectable="false">Will XDefiant have a battle royale mode?</h2> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">In a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1621382269289238528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet on February 2, 2023</a>, the <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin seemed opposed the idea of adding a battle royale game mode to the title. </p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">“We are solely focused on making a great and fun arena shooter. No BR. And we’re not moving on to a new game after this. We are going to keep making this game better and better! That is all.” </p> <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="903" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft has a troubled history with battle royale projects. In August 2020, the publisher launched its first free-to-play battle royale title Hyper Scape. Ultimately, the title fell short of expectations and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-battle-royale-hyper-scape-shutting-down/">shut down</a> in April 2022. That didn’t stop Ubisoft from returning to the well, as there were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-ubisoft-is-delaying-and-cancelling-its-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly</a> at least a dozen battle royale games at various points of development at some point. It’s unclear what happened to any of those projects, and it remains to be seen if Ubisoft has any plans to create another battle royale. </p>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="false">Yet when the new 6v6 arcade shooter <em>XDefiant</em> emerged, fans inevitably asked if this was Ubisoft potentially dipping its toe back into the battle royale genre. Albeit with the help of several supporting studios, <em>Call of Duty</em> proved that it’s possible to create a 6v6 and battle royale experience under the same umbrella. The framework is there for Ubisoft to replicate, but for now, we currently just have <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>
