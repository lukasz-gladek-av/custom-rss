Players will be split into two teams - Attackers or Defenders - and the goal is to either plant a reality-tearing Rift Point Device or stop the other team from doing so.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like other games of this style, there will be no respawns during a round and victory is achieved when the Rift Point Device explodes (45 seconds after planting!) or either team is wiped out. Players will swap teams every six rounds and the game will end when a team wins seven rounds total. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players will start a match with a Ranger Pistol and 800 Credits, and more credits can be earned by killing other players or planting the Rift Point Device. Credits can then be spent at the beginning of each round on weapons and items to help players and teams achieve victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If players survive a round, they will get to keep their gear and shields. Items they use will not carry over, but they can drop weapons, smoke grenades, and flashbangs for their team or even pick them off of eliminated players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of items, players will be able to choose one of five Flex Gadgets that they alone will be able to purchase and use during a match. Each player can hold up to two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory, and they can not be dropped or picked up by other players. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Ballistic Images: Weapons, Flex Gadgets, and Skyline 10 Map</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Flex Gadgets are as follows, via The Fortnite Team;</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Select the <strong>Proximity Mine </strong>to place a damaging mine down on the floor, wall, or ceiling to surprise an unsuspecting enemy. They can be picked back up and placed again and will explode if shot. Great for booby-trapping sites when defending!</li><li>The <strong>Bubble Shield</strong> allows for throwing down a temporary protective bubble that’s impervious to bullets and projectiles such as grenades. It’s great for providing a shield for your team as you storm onto a site. <br>The <strong>Recon Grenade</strong> gadget marks any enemies detected nearby where it’s thrown, even through walls. Throw a Recon gadget onto a site before entering to get a read on who might be waiting to get the drop on you.<br>Old faithful! A thrown <strong>Frag Grenade</strong> will bounce and explode, dealing damage to nearby enemies. Careful — you’ll take damage from your own grenades (though your allies will not). Great for flushing players out from behind cover.<br>The <strong>Impulse Grenade</strong> gadget is a disruptive tool that launches enemies and allies away. It has many creative uses, such as launching teammates onto a site from afar.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">When Fortnite Ballistic launches, it will do so with only one map - Skyline 10. There will also be a starting set of weapons and items, and adjustments will be made post-launch alongside new maps, weapons, and features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What will be there at launch, however, will be Unranked and Ranked modes. In Unranked, spots will be filled if players drop from a game and players can remain on the same server after a match if they'd like. In Ranked, there is no backfilling and a rank penalty will be filed to anyone who leaves and they won't be able to join another match for "a period of time." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Ranked Battle Royale and Reload, matchmaking in Ranked Ballistic is based on the average rank of a party.

            <p>This happened on Thursday, but we were busy with other, less interesting news. Late or not, I can't let it pass unremarked upon: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a>, the vast, weird roguelike which has been in development for 17 years, hit version 1.0. It brings multiple endings to the game, a revised UI, improved tutorials and much more.

<p>Caves Of Qud's 1.0 release has been polished up with some help from publisher Kitfox, known for - aside from their own games - working to bring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> to Steam. Caves Of Qud has a complex, reactive, detailed world, but it's worth stating that it was never as obtuse in its menus or controls as its peer. To aid those who do want to jump onboard, Kitfox worked with YouTuber SBPlaysGames to produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtvzwK2jzY&amp;ab_channel=KitfoxGames">an official beginner's tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4440081939137824126">on Steam</a>, the developers answered the inevitable "what's next" question. After 17 years of work, they're going to take a break, they say. "After that, we plan to continue updating the game, with two big feature arcs already in mind. Whether those are free updates or paid DLC has yet to be determined."
</p><p>I'm glad that they're still excited to work on new ideas for Caves Of Qud, but I do hope Freehold Games also turn their attention to a new game one day. It seems unlikely that we'll ever get to see that from Dwarf Fortress's developers, but I want to know what comes next from a team willing to work on such large projects.
</p>
<p>We haven't had a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">Marsh skated across its mutant pond</a> upon its arrival in Steam Early Access nine years ago. Now that Brendy is done with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-a-grand-adventure-that-keeps-faith-with-the-movies">Indy's tombs</a>, he's going to turn his attention to Qud's caves for a review before the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-doubles-all-time-player-peak-of-original-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently standing tallest during a stacked weekend of free game releases on Steam. Players have been patiently waiting in queue for early access to the hack-and-slash action RPG from Grinding Gear Games. But even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/">foreseen server issues</a> have not stemmed the wave of excitement for the game.</p>



<p>The most impressive part to PoE2’s hot start? The numbers so far are just from players that paid $30 for early access to a game that will eventually release free-to-play. Now that’s dedication.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-is-on-the-path-to-success">Path of Exile 2 is on the path to success</h2>



<p>As of the morning of December 7, Path of Exile 2 is at its highest player peak of 496,736 players, and that number is expected to climb. That places the game right behind the perpetual number one and two on the Steam player charts: Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. PoE2 is even outpacing another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massively popular recent release in Marvel Rivals</a>, which peaked at 444,286 players just a couple days prior.</p>



<p>The sequel to Path of Exile has more than doubled the original game’s all-time player peak of 229,337 players. Even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam reviews from players</a> that can’t even log in yet are positive, signaling exceptionally high anticipation for the game rivaling Blizzard’s ARPG giant Diablo. According to developers at GGG, over one million accounts redeemed early access for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first batch of reviews</a>, it’s high praise for Path of Exile 2. The consensus is that the sequel has improved on many, if not all of the features of the original game. PoE2 has also kept the things that help it stand out from other games in the genre, like its terrifyingly expansive skill trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-due-to-database-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access bugs get resolved</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise when Path of Exile 2’s player peaks continue to climb. Typically, when games release alongside widespread login issues, the response can be quite negative online. But even while enduring these massive login issues, there’s an incredible amount of positivity excitement around this game.</p>



<p>How long have you been in queue for Path of Exile 2?&nbsp;Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has revised its <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/units-discount">loyalty program</a>, allowing players to "exchange units on a wider selection of products".</p>
<p>In an email sent out to players subscribed to the loyalty scheme and seen by Eurogamer, Ubisoft announced that effective immediately, the units collected by players "will now also apply to pre-order and new release purchases made on the Ubisoft store", with 100 units equating to a 20 percent discount.</p>

<p>As well as 20 percent discount on games and DLC for every 100 units - you get one unit for every $/£1 spent - you can also get "exclusive" in-game content and rewards, like legendary weapons, character skins, emotes, and consumables.</p>
<p>If you're interested in signing up, don't forget that new Ubisoft accounts start with 100 units, which is enough for a 20% discount on your first Ubisoft Store purchase.</p>

However, the same report states that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games recently unveiled Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person shooter built into the game’s core platform. It’s a competitive shooter by nature, boasting both a ranked and unranked ecosystem, and it has been designed to mimic one of the best-known esports operating models in the world.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in early access on December 11 – but let’s talk about the game’s potential to disrupt the established Fortnite esports paradigm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ballistic-will-change-the-fortnite-scene">Ballistic Will Change the Fortnite Scene</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is a tactical shooter that borrows elements from Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Each game is split up into several rounds, and the model follows the traditional ‘attackers vs. defenders’ structure that we know from so many other games. In Ballistic, Attackers need to carry a Rift Point Device to one of two sites on the map and plant it while the defending team tries to prevent that from happening.</p>



<p>That’s as cut and dry as it gets in the esports world, and it’s a system mirrored by Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, and other games.</p>



<p>It’s a first-to-seven game, which means each series will be a lengthy one.</p>



<p>Like other titles, Fortnite Ballistic gives players the bare minimum when they start each match. They’ll have a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits, and they’ll need to manage their eco appropriately as the game unfolds, earning more credits for eliminating enemies and planting the Rift Point Device.</p>



<p>In many ways, this is the most cookie-cutter model possible, but in others, it could be a boon for the Fortnite esports ecosystem that has been sorely missing after many years of battle royale rotations.</p>



<p>In Ballistic, weapons and equipment have been tapered to a select few items, to keep things as balanced as possible. In place of abilities (like VALORANT), players can use ‘Flex Gadgets’ such as the Proximity Mine, Bubble Shield, and Recon Grenade to gain an edge over their opponents.</p>



<p>It sounds like a dream for competitive FPS fans, and the fact that it’s built in Fortnite – a free-to-play title – means that it’ll have a huge draw at launch on December 11. There will be a ranked and unranked offering for players to soak up, and new settings will be introduced to the game to address the addition of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>It’s only launching with one map, but imagine what things will look like when there is a host of maps and more equipment to flick through. This could be a cultural shift for the Fortnite esports ecosystem.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has just <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1865395948362293652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprised</a> fans with the reveal of Fortnite Ballistic, an upcoming 5v5 tactical first-person competitive game mode launching next week on the popular Battle Royale game. Due to debut in early access on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will release with a single map (Skyline 10), a starting set of weapons and a limited number of items. Epic plans to add more content and make changes based on player's feedback post-launch.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a Fortnite Ballistic match, players are divided into attackers and defenders, like in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, for example. Before the start, they can choose one of five Flex Gadgets to use during the match. Attackers have the goal of planting a reality-shattering Rift Point Device at one of two locations on the map, while defenders must foil their plan at all costs. A round is over when the Rift Point Device explodes or one of the teams is completely eliminated. After six rounds, players switch sides. The session ends when one team has won a total of 7 rounds.</p>
<p>In Fortnite Ballistic, players can buy their chosen gadget and keep two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory each round. These cannot be dropped or picked up by other players. When used correctly, Flex Gadgets can make a difference in the outcome of a round. A few examples: plant booby traps with the Proximity Mine, shield the team with the Bubble Shield, mark nearby enemies with the Recon Grenade, and flush out foes with the Frag Grenade or Impulse Grenade.</p>
<p>From the get-go, players will get to pick between Unranked and Ranked matches. The former option offers a more casual experience and provides backfill for players who drop out of matches. Ranked play, on the other hand, is for those who want to test their skills against other players in a competitive environment where the winning team gains rank and the losing team loses rank. Moreover, Ranked matches are not backfilled. Players who leave ranked matches will receive a rank penalty and will not be able to join another match for a period of time. Matchmaking in Ranked Fortnite Ballistic will be based on a party's average rank.</p>
<p>What do you think about this new mode? Does it interest you, or will you stick to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-rumored-to-return-permanently-starting-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanently returned Fortnite OG</a>?</p>

<p>Epic Games has lifted the lid on Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person experience built <strong>inside </strong>Fortnite. It’s launching in early access on December 11 with both ranked and unranked modes. It’ll serve as another angle to the Fortnite competitive ecosystem that players have loved for many years, but this time, the perspective has been completely altered.</p>



<p>In a post on the Fortnite blog, it was revealed that Fortnite Ballistic will launch into early access with <strong>one map</strong> – Skyline 10. It’ll drop with a select assortment of weapons and items, and as the community explores the game, Epic will make the necessary adjustments.</p>



<p>The new perspective starts here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-fortnite-ballistic">Introducing: Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a no-build competitive shooter that utilises the Fortnite platform in a much more intense way. It’s a no-holds-barred, 5v5 first-person shooter that’s broken down by rounds. Players are free to use their presets from the core platform, which means they’ll be able to use outfits, wraps, sprays, emotes, and more in Ballistic.</p>



<p>When it drops on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported <strong>except </strong>South Korea and Russia, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post revealed</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<p>To start the match, players are sorted into two teams, attacking and defending. The attackers will try to plant a device at site A or site B on the map, while the defenders try to defend said sites. It’s the most typical competitive operating model we know, and it’s replicated in the likes of Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Counter-Strike, and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Continuing the CS/VALORANT vibe, players will start each round with a pistol and credits, and as they play, they’ll unlock <strong>more </strong>credits, and thus better weapons and equipment.</p>



<p>It’ll have ranked and unranked modes from the get-go.</p>

            <p>Good news, Pokémon fans - Pokémon TV is back.</p>
<p>Pokémon TV, the app and website that let you watch episodes from the long-running Pokémon anime for free, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tv-app-axed-leaving-episodes-scattered-between-paid-streaming-services">was removed from app stores earlier this year</a>, but now it's returned, albeit in a new home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialPoke%CC%81monTV">YouTube</a> and with a truncated library.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the official Pokémon TV YouTube channel, where you can explore the world of Pokémon with Ash &amp; Pikachu!" announces the channel description. "Experience some of the most iconic moments from their adventure with our full episodes, live streams, compilations, and so much more!"</p>
<p>Right now only nine episodes from the first season are available, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRcHmntfmJ8CnSmj4C284-a1euH518aQa">playlist itself</a> seemingly contains another 16 unpublished videos, so it looks like more episodes are on the way.</p>
<p>The app's removal in March was especially upsetting given after that point, Pokéfans were unable to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service.</p>
<p>Now, however, it looks as though Pokémon has found a new home where fans can once again follow Ash for free.</p>
<p>In related Pokémon news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket is thought to have raked in over $200m during its first month of launch</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play. The report also said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is about to let <em>Fortnite</em> creators publish experiences with first-person modes, and to help show what’s possible, Epic itself is introducing a tactical FPS shooter that seems like it will play a lot like <em>Counter-Strike </em>or <em>Valorant.</em></p><p>The new mode, called “Ballistic,” is “an adrenaline-filled, round-based 5v5 competitive game mode where strategy, tactical teamwork, and individual prowess are essential for victory,” <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11">according to an Epic blog post</a>. Players will be split into two teams, with one that has to plant the bomb — sorry, I mean the “Rift Point Device” — and another that has to defend against that. Between rounds, you’ll be able to buy gear for the next one. Teams will switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds will be crowned the victor.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Epic has cribbed a game idea for <em>Fortnite: </em>its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993046/fortnite-is-going-full-speed-ahead">racing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">festival</a> modes both borrow a lot from Psyonix’s <em>Rocket League</em> and Harmonix’s <em>Rock Band</em> (Epic owns both studios), the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego</em> survival mode</a> has a lot of similarities to <em>Minecraft</em>, and Epic even admitted that the (now-gone) Impostors mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722606/epic-games-fortnite-imposters-mode-copy-among-us-credit">was inspired by <em>Among Us</em></a>. Heck, the game’s main battle royale mode was actually a spinoff that followed the success of <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>But now that Epic is trying to make <em>Fortnite</em> into something more akin to <em>Roblox</em> (another inspiration!), where players are encouraged to sample lots of experiences instead of just one, modes like Ballistic and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183255/its-going-to-be-a-busy-weekend-in-fortnite">Reload</a><em> </em>let Epic experiment with different ideas without changing the core battle royale experience. And since your purchased <em>Fortnite</em> outfits and gear generally work across all of the modes, there’s a financial incentive for Epic to add more experiences, too.</p><p>Ballistic launches in early access on December 11th. <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to publish their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">own experiences</a> with first-person modes <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1864747437384176063">that same day</a>.</p><div><p><em>Ballistic</em> is arriving during an already busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game’s Japanese-themed season kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island">at the beginning of the week</a>, and on Friday, Epic launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">permanent version of its throwback OG mode</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony had intended to team up with Nintendo on a disc-based, next-gen successor to the SNES. Then the Mario maker decided to stick with cartridges at the last minute, completely changing the console gaming timeline in the process. A new machine was born, one that gave us some of our favorite games ever made.

Be warned that if you win a round by detonating the Rift Point Device, you might still die in the explosion, which is going to be an interesting wrinkle for teams who have to defend the armed bomb from a team that wants to disarm it. The first team to win seven rounds takes the whole match.</p><p>In its announcement for the mode, Epic describes Ballistic as being "early access," rather than a fully featured new mode. That tracks with the fact that Ballistic will have just a single map at launch, the city-based Skyline 10.</p><p>Fortnite Ballistic will arrive with both ranked and unranked varieties. In ranked, the game will not backfill your team with new players if your allies leave--but if your game crashes or disconnects, you'll actually have a three-minute grace period to get back in, something Fortnite has never allowed in an official mode before. And, yes, there are leaver penalties in ranked Ballistic, including a short matchmaking ban.</p><p>Despite being a first-person mode, Fortnite Ballistic will support most of Fortnite's cosmetics, including skins and emotes.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Ballistic is a new 5v5 mode launching next week in early access within the main Fortnite client. 
</p>
<p>
It's also Epic Games' first proper foray into first-person for Fortnite - a move that has been long-awaited by some fans.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic arrives on Wednesday 11th December with one map - Skyline 10 - plus a limited number of weapons and items. These will all be expanded over time based on player feedback, Epic Games has said. 
</p>
<p>
Matches begin with players sorted into teams of either attackers or defenders. Attackers must deploy a payload - a Rift Point Device - while defenders must stop them. Players swap sides after six rounds, and the game is over when one team wins a seventh round in total.
</p><p>
If it all sounds a bit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> or Valorant, well, there's clearly inspiration here. But, of course, Fortnite is already full of character skins - which will all be supported - and so the different loadouts you get here seem more customisable.

<p>
Each match begins with players picking one of five Flex Gadgets, such as proxy mines, bubble shields, and different types of grenade that can launch you (and your enemies) or mark them for your teammates. 
</p>
<p>
As with most other Fortnite shooter modes, Ballistic will host both Ranked and Unranked modes, with the former offering a ladder to climb and penalities if you leave matches. 
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fortnite Ballistic follows yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-og-will-rotate-chapter-1-seasons-every-couple-of-months">arrival of Fortnite OG as a newly-permanent mode</a>, and last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-map">launch of Chapter 6 for the game's main battle royale</a> offering. 
</p>
<p>
Next up? Epic Games has already begun teasing a fresh update for its main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode that seems like it may feature the Storm King...

They ask you to join in their search for Chris, and the more you investigate and the more clues you gather, the closer you get to seeing the full picture of what really happened…</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Cutscenes with real actors paired with virtual landscapes combine the real and unreal to transport you to a mysterious and unsettling alternate dimension.</li><li>Text messages and voice calls that create an immersive game experience.</li><li>Unique exploration mechanics that make you feel you’re really there in the alternate dimensions.</li><li>A rich story filled with suspense and intrigue.</li><li>A wide variety of puzzles waiting to be solved.</li><li>Builds on the series tradition of Urban Legend Hunters and expands on the “modern culture-bound syndrome” phenomenon.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Urban Legend Hunters 2: Double - New Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ScgmBA8x5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="分身: 都市伝説チャンネル奇話 | 新PV公開！ 今冬発売予定で鋭意開発進行中！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaNkvh8UoFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="都市傳說冒險團2：分身 | 新PV現已公布！計劃於今冬發售！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QBdOZntUFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="都市传说冒险团2 ：分身 | 新PV现已公布！计划于今冬发售！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DonTS8NJkjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rhythm Psychosis</em> is a rhythm adventure game about a psychotic hikikomori girl—also an avid anonymous poster—who corrupts the world with her severe brain rot from listening to too many denpa songs. Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [95 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified. Social media is all about sharing – spread your heartful psychosis to everyone else!</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qtie</strong> – The main character. A hikikomori. She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!
