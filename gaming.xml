To celebrate, Blizzard released a new animated trailer featuring her doing some sick acrobatic tricks and taking out synthetic omnic goons. That’s all well and good, but what fans are honing in on are the final moments in which Freja is given a bounty hunting contract that hints at a long-awaited character finally making their debut. However, if you’re not super tuned into <em>Overwatch </em>lore, you might have no idea who he is.</p><p>Emre Sarioglu is a Turkish hero from the titular organization’s heyday before the events of the games, and has appeared only a few times in the series’ extended lore. His most prominent appearance is in a group photo of much of the OG team with a young Pharah; otherwise he’s mostly only been seen in the margins of the lore in things like the <em>Overwatch: Declassified </em>book. Sojourn has a voice line in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>saying Emre wanted to retire to Havana, but that’s pretty much it. The guy’s mostly an enigma, and that mystery has made him a bit of a running joke within the <em>Overwatch </em>community. Now, however, it seems like Blizzard may actually be bringing him into the fold with Freja, and fans are losing it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While it’s exciting that we might finally learn more about Emre, it’s unclear if this thread will be picked up any time soon. <em>Overwatch </em>loves to introduce characters in external media and then not get back to them for several years. For example, Mauga was first introduced in the short story <em>What You Left Behind </em>in 2019 and wasn’t added to the roster until <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s eighth season in 2023. At the very least we know Blizzard hasn’t completely forgotten him.</p><p>Freja’s test period will last from March 21 to 24; she’ll then officially join the roster in season 16 on April 22.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This consists of LightSpeed Studios’ latest research and development breakthroughs, which push the boundaries of graphics and performance to enhance in-game realism, as showcased in workshops during GDC 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>LightSpeed Studios Sets the Stage for a New Era for LightSpeed Japan Studio</strong></p><p>Building on this approach, legendary game director and head of LightSpeed Japan Studio, Hideaki Itsuno, is revealing at GDC 2025 that he’s entering the arena and embarked on the early stages of bringing his own visionary AAA game title to life. Drawing on his extensive experience directing games and building incredible teams at <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> that drove the remarkable successes of <em>Devil May Cry</em>, the Capcom <em>Alpha</em> series, <em>Capcom VS. <a title="Companies > SNK Corporation [412 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/snk">SNK</a></em>, and many more iconic game titles, Itsuno is ready to apply the same principles of creative freedom, efficiency, and humility to assemble an outstanding team and create something truly groundbreaking.</p><p>“We’re building a creative environment that combines diverse cultural perspectives with cutting-edge technology,” said LightSpeed Japan Studio general manager Hideaki Itsuno. “Our focus is on developing gameplay elements that offer players entirely new experiences—the kind of innovations that make players say I’ve never seen that in a game before.”</p><p><strong>Leveraging Global Talent and Nurturing Creative Freedom</strong></p><p>Additionally, to foster fresh perspectives in original game development, LightSpeed Studios is adopting a model that enables each studio to shape its own culture, advocating for original thinking within teams. Bringing to the table Eastern and Western game philosophies, LightSpeed Studios is positioned to encourage regional teams to exchange ideas, blend cultural influences, and unite under a shared vision—creating truly global gaming experiences.</p><p>A standout example of this approach is being led by the vice president of LightSpeed Studios, Steve C. Martin, known for his commitment to five-year development cycles. Focused on bringing his original AAA open world action title, Last Sentinel, to life, Steve has assembled a world-class, global team. Despite talent from prestigious studios like Rockstar Games, Meta and EA Games, LightSpeed LA has fostered not only a culture of creative freedom but ensures product efficiency, thanks to Steve’s emphasis on humility and a willingness to embrace constructive feedback.</p><p>“Any game studio’s ambition lies with developing original games,” said Martin. “The creative freedom of creating your own lore from scratch, building a compelling narrative, and all the upsides from this is the dream of any studio, and that’s why LightSpeed Studios is the place to be.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After the game’s opening act, your first line of business is to find Tomiko and establish your hideout. This is your base of operations where you’ll accrue allies and build facilities, though you’ll quickly find one of the most valuable ones is locked off: the Forge. You’ll see that this building has the prerequisite “Recruit a Blacksmith,” so naturally, you’ll want to knock that off your to-do list.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195922,196345" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>To get your own blacksmith, look for the quest “Way Of The Blacksmith” in the Objectives tab of your main menu under Tomiko’s icon</strong>. You might recall that Tomiko mentions recruiting a blacksmith named Heiji in the cutscene where she and Naoe discuss the first two Onryo to hunt, so you’ll almost certainly have access to this quest if you’re reading this. Of course, assuming you’re playing on the game’s default settings, you’ll have to do a tiny bit of legwork to track Heiji down, so you can check out his location below if you just want to get to him right away.</p><h2 id="h7012"><a id=""></a>’The Way Of The Blacksmith’ quest location</h2><p>As the game’s hints directly indicate, <strong>Heiji is located in Sekai</strong>. <strong>You’ll find this area directly southwest of the hideout</strong>. Sekai is also where you’ll begin your hunt for the Golden Teppo, so you can kill two birds with one stone by going there first. Well, technically you kill one bird and recruit another bird, but you get the picture.</p><figure id="" data-id="533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-recommend-id="image://533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the map in Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

Pick whichever dialogue option feels best to you, and Heiji will make his way to Tomiko’s hideout.

Upon talking with him, you’ll have access to the following options:</p><p><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Invest resources into any piece of equipment to increase its level. Equipment cannot be higher than your character’s level (level equivalent gear simply won’t appear). You can use Gold to immediately upgrade a piece of equipment to your current level, but Gold is a rare resource that should not be confused with normal currency (Mon). <strong>Save your Gold for bigger upgrades down the road; don’t use it by accident in the early game</strong>!</p><p><strong>Engrave</strong>: Apply one of your found Engravings to an applicable piece of gear (it will say “Visit the Hideout’s blacksmith to engrave a perk” under its stats). Engravings are not consumed upon use and can be overridden, though note this process will consume Mon every time.</p><p><strong>Salvage</strong>: Break down a piece of gear into upgrade materials.<br></p><p>In short, if you find a great piece of gear that proves essential to your build, come here to refine it as you play to keep its stats relevant. And if you’re just beginning your journey in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, be sure to keep some resources on hand for when Yasuke joins your party! <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s first Day One release on Steam it’s already climbed the platform’s all-time player peak charts to become third in series history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/not-even-1-day-after-release-assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-on-steam-already-has-valhalla-beat-and-now-its-coming-for-odyssey-and-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Assassin’s Creed Shadows is off to a great start on Steam, achieving an all-time player peak of 41,412 on the first day (at the time of writing). To compare, Shadows has more than doubled AC Valhalla’s numbers, which peaked at 15,679 2.3 years ago. It is less than 150 players away from beating AC Origins’ peak, 41,551, which arrived 7.4 years ago. AC Odyssey still stands strong at the moment, peaking at 62,069 6.4 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding AC Shadows reviews on Steam, things seem to be going well for Ubisoft, with the platform categorising it as “Very Positive”. If you are interested in an in-depth review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you can check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s review</a> of the title, where we described the game as “Great, But The Blade Still Needs Sharpening”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest instalment of Ubisoft’s popular series. For those unaware of the game, the new setting takes players to Feudal Japan, where they explore a fresh narrative set in a vast open world through the eyes of dual protagonists.</p>



<p>The new protagonists are Yasuke and Naoe, both featuring distinct playstyles. One is a stealthy Assassin, and the other is a legendary Samurai; players must master both characters to take down enemies with precision and power. The game also introduces a fully customisable hideout where you train your crew, craft/upgrade weapons, and interact with characters.&nbsp;</p>

Now, with the discovery of a domain registration, hopes that we'll see a Persona 4 remake are that much higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Faz</a>, a domain for "p4re.jp" was recently registered.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nintendo don’t want you to know this, but other handheld gaming platforms do still exist. While the Nintendo Switch is the apex predator of consoles you can take on holiday, there are now more alternatives than at any other time – I feel like I should be whispering this in case Mario looms in the doorway, ready to enforce the big N’s will.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck, and portable PCs like the ROG Ally nab their own share of the food chain, but there’s a huge movement happening in the retro handheld space. Here, companies like Anbernic and Powkiddy are breaking new ground, with Chinese manufacturers focusing on reuniting gamers with the best titles of yesteryear. The <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/en-gb/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld">Retroid Pocket 5 </a>is the latest from Retroid, offering a luxurious, fully featured handheld that isn’t just for old games.</p>



<p>The Retroid Pocket 5’s design owes some level of gratitude to the Sony employees who worked on the PlayStation Vita. In the black colour scheme of our review unit, it could almost be 2012 all over again, but since the Vita was a classy and sleek device that was ahead of its time, those visual similarities aren’t a bad thing.</p>
<p>The Pocket 5 gains some extra curvature at the rear, and that’s definitely not something to complain about. It makes it much more comfortable to hold than either the Vita or the Nintendo Switch. It’s still a small console though, so depending on the size of your hands, you may run the risk of developing cramp. Personally, I had no problems.</p>

<p>Once you’ve powered the Retroid Pocket 5 up, it’s obvious that this is a thoroughly new and modern device, not least thanks to the RGB lights that encircle each analogue stick. The physical form of the Pocket 5 makes it just about pocket-friendly, but compared to devices like the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch, it’s a true handheld, and something that you can pack in your bag without thinking about if you need to sacrifice something else to make space.</p>

<p>You probably should treat it with some care, though, as the Retroid Pocket 5 is $219/£180, which, while cheaper than some of the top-end retro-flavoured devices, is still a significant investment. You want to know that this thing will last you several years, and in terms of build quality, it feels as though the Retroid Pocket 5 will last you through many, many replays of Final Fantasy 7 or Panzer Dragoon Saga.</p>
<p>All of the expected controls are here, from the four main face buttons, albeit with the letters in a Nintendo Switch layout rather than the more common Xbox one (though you can set it to emulate one in the settings) to the D-pad and dual analogue sticks. The sticks are excellent, boasting that much-desired Hall Effect tech to ensure they don’t wear out for a very long time. Though they’re relatively small, they feel great in use, and I was consistently surprised by how responsive they were.</p>
<p>The shoulder buttons and triggers are amongst the best I’ve found on a handheld, the shoulders boasting gloriously clicky microswitches, and true analogue triggers beneath them. The triggers have a remarkable level of activation, especially considering what they’re attached to. If you’re a fan of racing games they’re a top-tier inclusion that you don’t tend to get in the retro-handheld space.</p>
<p>While the Pocket 5’s physical build is sleek and stylish, the specs under the hood continue to impress. The main point of excitement is the 5.5-inch OLED screen, which runs at 1080p and 60Hz. It’s bright, it’s vibrant, and on the black model it seamlessly blends into the body of the console. With a widescreen aspect, you’re able to play games from multiple generations, as well as watch content via a streaming service as well.</p>

<p>The reason that you’re going to be able to do that is that the Retroid Pocket 5 runs on Android 13. You can install all of your favourite Android apps and games, using the touchscreen as the interface, and if games support it, you can also use the physical controls, which function like any other Bluetooth controller.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Snapdragon 865 chipset and 8GB of RAM, you can play all of the most challenging Android games right now, and I enjoyed jumping into Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero and Infinity Nikki, all of which ran fantastically. Being able to play with physical controls helped to make them feel better than ever, and utterly unlike mobile phone games.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the Retroid Pocket 5 though, chances are you’re here for retro games. Now, we’re not going to get into the muddy waters of emulation, ROMs and ownership here, but legally speaking, you should own a copy of a game for you to use the ROM of it. We’ve got a healthy collection of older games stashed in boxes and cupboards, so this is a perfect way (and excuse) to revisit some classics. But they don’t have to be&nbsp;<em>too</em> retro.</p>
<p>The Pocket 5 is powerful, particularly in the context of Android retro devices, and that means that it’s capable of emulating systems up to and including the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube and even some Nintendo Switch games. With 128GB of internal storage, there’s plenty of space for those ROMs as a starting point, but there’s also a MicroSD expansion slot which will allow you to carry a huge library of retro games around with you on the go.</p>

<p>It comes with a host of emulators already installed, but you’ll have to do some legwork if you want to make everything look and feel more like a coherent console experience. My favourite frontend is ES-DE, and while you have to subscribe and download that from their website rather than Goggle Play, there’s plenty of guides online if you’re stuck. The finicky nature of this process isn’t unique to the Pocket 5, but if you’re after a simple experience, other retro-flavoured consoles are more straightforward. They likely do less, though.</p>
<p>With a little work, the retro gaming experience on the Retroid Pocket 5 is fantastic, not least thanks to the incredible screen and the excellent controls. Returning to games like Sonic Adventure 2, Virtua Tennis and Metropolis Street Racer – alright, I’m a Dreamcast nut – looks and feels incredible, and you’ll marvel that a handheld this size can now play games that used to need a full home console to play. It’s nostalgic and it’s part of video game preservation – what more could you want?</p>
<p>Well, you might want to play modern console games, and the Retroid Pocket 5 actually has you covered there too, thanks to the wonders of streaming. You can stream PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC titles to the Pocket 5 with very little hassle, positioning it as one of the absolute best handheld devices out right now. I played a bunch of Yakuza: Like A Dragon on Game Pass, and most of the time it felt like I was playing it natively. Thanks to the 5000mAh battery and the smartphone innards, it also lasted far longer than any other handheld device I own, making the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally look pathetic in terms of battery life.</p>

<p>I love the Retroid Pocket 5’s form factor. I’m a little tired of the Nintendo Switch and the ROG Ally taking up as much of my bag as they do, and while not only taking up less space, the Pocket 5 will outlast them by hours upon hours. If you’re after the biggest hit of nostalgia there’s a purple Gamecube-styled colourway, a Grey SNES-inspired one, and then the white or black options. The black one is exceedingly sleek though, and looks like a true premium device. If you’re interested in something similar, but without the full outlay, the Retroid Pocket 3 and 4 are still excellent retro handhelds. Alternatively, if you’re able to spend more, don’t care about size, and want to add native PC gaming, it’s hard to fault the Steam Deck OLED.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-4-remake-potentially-confirmed-by-new-domain-registration.1140240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-domain-registration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An eagle-eyed social media user has spotted the registration of a brand new web domain that could point towards the existence (and possible imminent reveal) of a&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>As spotted by YouTuber Faz <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, the domain "p4re.jp" was registered earlier today. The registrant is listed as "not displayed by registrant's request", which could well be an attempt on publisher Atlus' part to obfuscate the&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake until it's time for the game to be revealed.</p>

<p>Faz points out that two years ago, the domain "p3re.jp" was registered in a similar fashion, and three months after that domain was registered,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-persona-5-tactica-leaked-by-atlus-itself" rel="nofollow">was officially revealed</a>. We could well be about to see a repeat of that particular pattern.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-4-remake-domain-rumor-yosuke.jpg?itok=_HzGrYP8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-4-remake-domain-rumor-yosuke.jpg?itok=bNAnJTUa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If by "it", you mean the wait for a&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake, Yosuke, then you might be right.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the domain registration isn't necessarily concrete evidence that&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake is on the way, nor is it a guarantee that Atlus or Sega were the ones who registered the domain.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>was preceded by a similar registration perhaps makes this more compelling evidence than the usual rumor mill. I, for one, am hoping against hope that we are indeed about to get&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Reload</em>.</p>

<p>If it is happening, then we may well get a reveal during one of the upcoming Summer Games Fest showcases;&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>was, after all, announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2023-find-all-announcements-trailers-reveals-here" rel="nofollow">during 2023's Xbox summer show</a>.</p>

<p>Another reveal during an Xbox show could also mean that&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Reload</em>&nbsp;lands on Game Pass on day one, which would be another blessing for subscribers. Of course, all of this is speculation at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-persona-4-remake-rumor.jpg?itok=HaOQSd0n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-persona-4-remake-rumor.jpg?itok=nzNY5rHh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>-style&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>We will, of course, have to wait and see whether a&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake is in the offing.

                <p>An update for Assassin's Creed Shadows on launch day makes a couple key changes to the game's shrines, preventing players from destroying certain items in them. The patch comes amid a discussion about cultural sensitivity in the 16th-century Japan game.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to IGN</a>, the update changes the game so that the monks inside of the shrines no longer bleed when attacked, while tables and racks throughout the game's temples and shrines are now indestructible. Bowls and drums can be broken, however, and tables can be moved and pushed.</p><p>Earlier this week, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded to a question about Assassin's Creed Shadows and its shrines. He said, as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, that "defacing a shrine is out of the question--it is an insult to the nation itself. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them."</p><p>Hiroyuki Kada, a Japanese politician, said he fears that if people can vandalize a shrine in Assassin's Creed Shadows, it might "encourage similar behavior in real life."</p><p>"Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided," he said.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/shoheikondo/status/1885391745854173688" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">viral video posted earlier this year</a> showed a player running through a shrine and causing havoc. This was not an objective of any specific quest, but instead the player choosing to do this.</p><p>In July 2024, Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">put out a statement</a> in which it said Shadows is a work of fiction, and one that Ubisoft enlisted the help of external consultants, historians, and researchers as part of an effort to "inform our creative choices." Ubisoft also acknowledged that some of the game's promotional materials at the time "caused concern within the Japanese community," and for that, Ubisoft said, "We sincerely apologize."</p><p>Shadows is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, featuring the protagonists <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-or-naoe-switch-characters/2900-6333/" data-ref-id="2900-6333">Naoe and Yasuke</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valnet-report-freelance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We wrote about Valnet’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low pay rates</a> in a previous article about how underpaid freelancers are propping up games journalism. Today, new reporting by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valent-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wrap</a> shines more light on what’s going on behind the scenes of the owner of sites such as GameRant, The Gamer, and DualShockers.</p><p>The Wrap’s article focuses more on Valnet’s entertainment sites than gaming, talking to people who’ve written for sites like Collider and MovieWeb. A former Valnet contributor told The Wrap that Valnet "present themselves as a safe haven for young and experienced writers, but they end up paying bargain-basement rates and forcing contractors to create junky clickbait.”</p><p>The Wrap reports that Valnet maintains a spreadsheet of “blacklisted freelancers,” which for 2025 contains over 400 names of writers barred from writing for the company for offenses such as posting Valnet rates on social media, calling rates “abysmal,” and suggesting Valnet put rates in job listings.</p><p>The Wrap also writes that, after a Valnet contributor filed a lawsuit against the company’s labor practices, Valnet asked contractors to sign releases promising not to join any class actions against the company. In exchange, they would receive $100. After few people accepted, Valnet bumped the offer to $200.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s no surprise that Valnet relies on a network of low-paid freelancers, a depressingly common practice across plenty of online sites. People who spoke to The Wrap say that after Valnet acquired their sites, freelance rates dropped dramatically, and that “access to health insurance and benefits evaporated as full-time employees were rehired as at-will contractors.”</p><p>Valnet built its name on acquiring sites and continues to seek more, The Wrap reports, another <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common strategy</a> in online media these days. Nothing in here is particularly surprising, which is what makes it so depressing. As journalism jobs dwindle, especially in games journalism, these kinds of practices&nbsp; may unfortunately become even more prevalent.</p><p>It’s hard to know what to <em>do</em> around any of this, especially when writing jobs are so thin on the ground and the cost of living continues to rise. If you're looking for a place to start, the <a href="https://freelancesolidarity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freelance Solidarity Project</a> has guides and resources for freelancers, and some states and cities have passed “<a href="https://freelancersunion.org/advocacy/freelance-isnt-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance isn’t free</a>” acts that strive to protect freelancers from misclassifications, delayed payments, and more.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/apple-cider-vinegar-common-side-effects"><h3>Is It The Right Time For Shows About Wellness Conspiracies?</h3></a><p>Recent shows Apple Cider Vinegar and Common Side Effects both debunk and amplify current conspiracies</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk"><h3>CWA And Video Game Workers Launch New Industry-Wide Union Anyone Can Join, Even If They’ve Been Laid Off</h3></a><p>With the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board under attack by Trump, CWA is trying something old and new</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-addresses-online-negativity-over-lowest-rated-metal-gear-solid-game-in-the-series/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nearly 11 years after its release, Hideo Kojima has taken to X to express his feelings over the negative feedback that Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes received when it was released.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-legacy-video-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is one of the finest auteurs of his generation across all mediums. His calculated approach to cinematic presentation and innovation has accompanied the director across his multi-decade career. Metal Gear Solid is arguably his crowning achievement, and many of the entries are some of the most heralded releases in the annals of gaming history.</p>



<p>One entry has proved divisive. Although it’s looked upon more favorably in hindsight, Ground Zeroes was the subject of much criticism when it first launched.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s still an incredible game. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes was considered a “Prologue to the new gameplay” of Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain, and it was originally supposed to be part of The Phantom Pain. However, as <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima</a> puts it in his statement on X: “The PS4 was released and there were only a few titles out, so just GZ was released ahead of the others.”</p>



<p>Kojima and Konami opted to release it as a standalone piece of bite-sized action, and Ground Zeroes looked and played incredibly—thanks to the new and improved Fox Engine. But its brief runtime was an inescapable negative at the time. </p>



<p>Reflecting, Kojima has said: “Although the episodes were short, we threw in as many gameplay elements as possible. Although it is recognized now, 11 years later, there was online negativity at the time saying, “Selling a demo version at a low price?” and it received the lowest rating in the MGS series.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>Already 11 years ago😅

This was originally planned to demonstrate the FOX engine and the gameplay of an open world infiltration game. I thought of it as an episode connecting PW and MGSV TPP, to be a bridge for both generations (console and handheld). We were considering </span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s clear that Hideo Kojima is proud of the work, and it’s fair because Ground Zeroes was a great—if not compact—MGS experience. The original plan would happen sometime later as Metal Gear Solid V: Definitive Experience was released. It bundles Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain into one complete MGS package.</p>



<p>Kojima has moved on from MGS with Death Stranding.

Feel free to completely ignore G-force in the name of awesomeness, and keep smashing, crashing and crushing to stay in the flow!</li><li><strong>Non-Stop <a title="Platforms > Arcade [376 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">Arcade</a> <a title="Genres > Action [2,583 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a></strong> – Tons of standalone levels (How many? we don’t know yet, we’re still making them! but there will be plenty!) packed with fresh things to punch, easily navigable through a revolutionary new innovation we call a “map screen”.
