Here are some of the best games we’ve played so far in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Fight a giant pink baboon that tries to kill you with its farts. Bob and weave on the back of a bird-like raptor as you track a majestic dragon across a desert during a booming thunderstorm. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>offers these experiences and more in a tightly wound, streamlined package that’s lavishly presented and fun as hell to play. Yes, the inventory is a mess. No, the story won’t win any awards. There’s still decades of franchise design baggage to occasionally grapple with, but it’s all in service of some of the most entertaining emergent battles ever produced in a video game, powered by an elegant but deep combat system that never misses a beat. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>is a heartfelt, narrative-focused social sim with rhythm elements that puts you in the shoes of Rama, a musician who recently lost his partner and essentially went into hiding for a year. As he tries to reintegrate into his social circle and band, <em>Afterlove EP </em>focuses on the mundane and ugly parts of grief and how it can distort us into unlikable versions of ourselves. Repairing yourself after you’ve gone through something painful isn’t glamorous, it’s just work. <em>Afterlove EP </em>takes you through one month of Rama’s life as he tries to figure out his shit when his entire world has been shattered. That work takes longer than mere weeks, but at least through your decisions, you can give Rama a good head start. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Don’t Nod’s return to supernatural young adult drama is off to an excellent start. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s first half blends the deceptive allure of ‘90s nostalgia with an unsettling modern-day mystery, and the result is one of the studio’s most tantalizing stories since <em>Life Is Strange 2</em> in 2019. Through its awkward but likable heroine Swann, <em>Lost Records</em> illustrates the hardships of growing up sensitive, shy, and unsure of yourself. The connections between its cast of four young women are raw and earnest, and it makes the mystery of what could have happened to these friends that would cause them to go decades without speaking all the more compelling. I can’t wait to see where it goes when episode two launches in April. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s third go at its signature cooperative adventure format is its best one yet. <em>Split Fiction</em> blends video game and narrative genres into a constant dopamine drip that never seems to run out of ideas. Its many fantasy and sci-fi worlds are pretty derivative, but Hazelight manages to design so many clever puzzles and mechanics within them that the game’s takes on those ideas still feel fresh. As generic as those levels are, <em>Split Fiction </em>gives them meaning by insisting on the importance of the human element of storytelling and art, which makes fighting through those stages to save them from corporate clutches all the more satisfying. It also has one of the most mind-blowing final stretches I’ve played in recent memory. What a game. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The discourse around <em>Avowed</em>’s release was fascinating. It felt like a process of elimination, the wider gaming public trying to work out what Obsidian’s RPG <em>wasn’t</em>, before it could figure out what it actually is. It’s not like <em>Skyrim</em>, as some had tried to say it would be, and it’s not like a BioWare RPG either, with 100+ hours of intricate questing. It’s also not like <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, the isometric traditional cRPGs from Obsidian in whose universe it takes place. But when this all eventually settled, the result was something an awful lot of people realized was exactly what they wanted: a manageable first-person RPG with a rich story, great characters, and chunky combat, that “only” asks for 30 to 40 hours of your life.</p><p>By stripping back various elements from the genre, and creating a more focused interpretation of a usually more sprawling format, Obsidian was able to give great emphasis to the excellent combat, making a game that felt enormous and still offered huge amounts of side-questing and exploration, but also maintained a clip that propelled you toward its narrative conclusion. It’s also just tremendously fun, and despite the plague-ridden setting, maintains an upbeat feel that matches its colorful design. A splash of happiness is just what we need. — John Walker</p></div><div><p>The <em>Yakuza </em>series is like a chameleon that somehow always finds a way to play with different genres and storylines. <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii </em>takes the crime soap opera series and turns it into a swashbuckling pirate adventure, and commits to the bit so hard that it actually works. Fan-favorite antihero Goro Majima takes on the starring role for the first time, and he’s the perfect frontman for the series to lean into an implausible premise with. But while this game sees the series charting wacky new narrative territory accompanied by new ship battles and other pirate-y accoutrements, <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>still has plenty of the beat-em-up action and endearingly silly social antics fans have come to know and love. How much longer can RGG Studio keep shifting genres while still feeling true to the series’ roots? With <em>Pirate Yakuza</em>,<em> </em>they clearly haven’t jumped the shark yet. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Part cyberpunk RPG, part gig economy sim,<em> Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>expands on the incredible first game with a much more expansive world, more characters, new systems, and tons more fantastic writing. It cleverly weaves together disparate tales of corporate oppression, fallen empires, and interstellar communities using the power of dice rolls and skill checks. The result is a winning formula that fuses top-tier video game storytelling with engrossing tabletop mechanics. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Soulslike metroidvanias are a dime a dozen, but few are as good as <em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em>. It takes place across a sprawling 2D kingdom full of automatons that have become corrupted by a mysterious blight. You fight them to gain their powers and then use those to win even bigger, more spectacular boss fights. The story is more of a moodboard than a fully-fleshed out tale, which works perfectly to give the proceedings a compellingly grim fantasy flavor without ever weighing down the combat and exploration, which is where <em>Bloom in the Mist</em> really excels. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is so back. <em>Origins</em> isn’t everything I want the historical hack-and-slash series to be but it’s a perfect foundation for the game on modern platforms. It cleverly melds the possibilities enabled by new tech with the tried-and-true arcade formula of being a one-fighter, army-stomping machine. Combat is excellent with new parry mechanics, and an overhead map section gives the connective tissue in between battles a massive upgrade. There’s never been a better time to pursue Lu Bu. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Keep Driving</em>—a 2D pixel art RPG about going on a long road trip in the ‘90s—offers the thrill of a road trip without breaking the bank or using up all your vacation time. In<em> Keep Driving</em>, you’ll have to manage your car, your hunger, and your sleep, keep going in the right direction, and deal with hazards like traffic jams and deer. Pull it off and you’ll reach your destination, a music festival, before the end of summer. Of course, like any good road trip, detours might lead you to something unexpected… - Zack Zwiezen<br></p></div><div><p>An RPG doesn’t need to be bigger than <em>Skyrim </em>to be good, and <em>Eternal Strands </em>gets this. Instead of offering a massive sandbox, this third-person physics-focused fantasy RPG provides exciting combat and smaller, more detailed zones to explore. Get ready to climb big monsters and chuck small creatures off of cliffs in this colorful indie RPG. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Not only is <em>Slender Threads</em> a splendid point-and-click adventure game, with top-notch art and voice acting as well as great puzzles, but it’s also the most extraordinary meta-exploration of the form, yet without any of that tedious knowing winking that often plagues games committed to such commentary.</p><p>Harvey Green is a wannabe writer and door-to-door book salesman, living in an ambiguous era, having just arrived in an anonymous small American town. Things are…eerie here, but it’s not until you solve a fairly standard bizarro point-and-click puzzle—dressing up a mannequin to put into a busy road crossing to try to distract a policeman—that the real nature of <em>Slender Threads</em> begins to reveal itself. And no, I shall not spoil it here. Let’s just say it explores the notion of the amoral central character.</p><p>It’s also, crucially, a really good adventure game at the same time. A really fantastic find. — John Walker</p></div><div><p>I’m scared to look at how many hours I’ve put into <em>Two Point Museum</em>, the latest entry in the wacky Two Point sim series. There’s just something supremely satisfying about slowly but methodically building up a thriving museum complete with decorations, gift shops, and employee-only areas. If you want a sim game that will make you laugh, tickle your brain, and suck away hours of your life, you should play <em>Two Point Museum. </em>-Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p><em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em> is part ragdoll physics racer and part serene sightseeing sim. It nails the feel of shifting your weight and controlling your momentum as you cruise down white powder slopes and perfectly manages to balance the thrill of the race with the calm satisfaction of working through each map like a platforming puzzle. It’s as exacting, elegant, and effortless in its design as it is to play. - Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/reinvention-is-key-to-god-of-wars-continued-success<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The God of War series has been an important fixture across four generations of PlayStation consoles. But when Kratos’ vengeance-filled journey to becoming the new god of war began in 2005, few could have foreseen where the angry deity destroyer would be 20 years later. Where other long-running franchises have struggled to stay relevant for multiple gaming generations, God of War has survived thanks to its willingness to change. The most important change, of course, was the radical 2018 reboot that plucked Kratos out of Ancient Greece and immersed him in the world of Norse mythology. It dramatically changed both the presentation and gameplay style of the series. But even before that critically acclaimed reboot, developer Sony Santa Monica had implemented a number of smaller, but nonetheless interesting changes that ensured the series’ survival.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reinvention will be key to God of War’s continued success in the future, too. When the series moved to its Norse setting, director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/05/future-god-of-war-games-could-take-on-egyptian-or-mayan-mythology">Cory Barlog spoke of his wish</a> of “going on to the Egyptian era and the Mayan era and so on and so forth.” <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-new-god-of-war-game-egyptian-mythology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent rumours</a> have once again brought up an Egyptian setting. Even if this is all hopeful thinking rather than genuine insider news, it’s understandable why people yearn for Kratos to visit the land of the pyramids: Ancient Egypt has a distinct culture and powerfully rich mythology. But a new setting is just the start: wherever God of War goes next, it must reinvent itself in much the same way as when it took the components that worked so well for the series’ Greek trilogy and updated (and, in some ways, improved) them for the highly acclaimed Norse games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/20/god-of-war-ragnarok-combat-1740059805617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War's combat changed significantly for the Norse games, but it stayed true to the furious spirit of the original Greek trilogy. | Image credit: Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series has never shied away from making changes from entry to entry, of course. The original Greek games evolved across the span of a decade, refining their hack and slash gameplay and polishing it to a mirror shine by the release of God of War 3. At the end of the trilogy, Kratos had access to a revamped magic system that complimented the combo-based rhythms of melee combat, and faced an even greater variety of challenging enemies. That final chapter was built for the PlayStation 3, which offered a substantial power increase over the PS2 that the first two games were designed for, and so new camera angles provided even better views of what was in 2010 a graphical powerhouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of what defined these original games was lost in the reboot. The Greek trilogy incorporated plenty of platforming and puzzle game elements to help Kratos achieve his goals. Those platforming sections were phased out of the Norse games, in part due to a change in camera angles – the new third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective just didn’t work for that kind of approach. The puzzles remained, but were reformulated to fit God of War’s new adventure-first design. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>By returning to the series’ Greek roots both mechanically and narratively in Valhalla, Kratos’ story came full circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see this kind of re-fit applied to a number of the series’ original concepts. From God of War 2 onwards, the games featured battle arenas that allowed players to set difficulty levels and choose their opponents. These formed some of the most memorable moments of the original series, but were lost in the 2018 reboot. But Valhalla, the roguelike DLC for God of War Ragnarök, featured the return of battle arenas, which had been adapted for the new Norse mythology setting. This return to a feature of the past was poetically mirrored by the DLC’s story, which saw the Norse god of war, Týr, invite Kratos to Valhalla to confront the ghosts of his past. By returning to the series’ Greek roots both mechanically and narratively, Kratos’ story came full circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Norse God of War games are not just reinterpretations of past ideas, though. This second iteration of the franchise includes a swathe of new additions, including the unique throwing mechanics for the Leviathan Axe, a combat-defining parry system enabled by a series of shield types and, in Ragnarök, a magical spear that allows for a much faster, explosive attack style. These are your tools for travelling across the Nine Realms, each of which has its own particular foes, visuals and other disparate characteristics. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/20/god-of-war-3-story-1740060215344.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The original trilogy had solid writing, but the Norse duology took God of War's story to unexpected new heights. | Image credit: Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the mechanics of battle and exploration are the obvious changes, the creative gulf between the original trilogy and the Norse duology is most clearly observed in the games’ approach to story. Across the second era, we feel the loss and heartache Kratos experiences for his late wife and how this fuels a fire within him. He is outwardly bitter towards his son, Atreus, and the pair’s uneasy relationship is at the heart of the two games. Both uncover unexpected hidden truths about themselves. All this is a far cry from the more brutish storytelling of the original trilogy, and the more emotive approach is almost certainly the key to the Norse era’s resounding critical and commercial success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War’s radical shift in both mechanical design and storytelling approach is the result of a different kind of thinking when it comes to franchises. The series’ creators have said that they don’t view the Norse games as sequels in the traditional sense, but rather as extensions of Kratos’ journey. This attitude should sit at the core of any future installments. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Norse games are not sequels in the traditional sense, but rather extensions of Kratos’ journey.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, radical reinvention on its own is not a foolproof way of generating escalating success. Just look at Assassin’s Creed, another series that has frequently changed location and time period. While consistently profitable, Ubisoft's long-running series has struggled to secure continued fan adornment across multiple console generations in the same way God of War has. Following the 2017 shift to an open world RPG design with Assassin’s Creed Origins, the series links to its foundational Assassin’s guild lore has become more and more tenuous. What began as a series linked by the story of Desmond Miles has lost much of its narrative connective tissue, and the new RPG era of games have ultimately proved more divisive with each passing installment. General criticism has been aimed at the series’ increasing content bloat – the classic “bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better” argument – but long-term fans are increasingly frustrated by the series drifting away from its assassin roots towards Spartan and Viking power fantasies. Fantasies that many believe would have been better served as standalone RPGs.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series has now attempted a couple of course corrections, starting with 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage; a soft reboot and return to the series’ Middle Eastern roots. It revived the gameplay and structure of the earlier games and offered a considerably shorter story, which was reasonably well received by both critics and fans. This year, Assassin’s Creed Shadows looks to be continuing in a similar vein thanks to the introduction of Naoe, a character wholly dedicated to the stealth gameplay that was foundational for the original Xbox 360-era games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mixed fortunes of Assassin’s Creed’s shift in style shows that abandoning what made a series successful can cause rifts within the fanbase. This is something the God of War series has skilfully navigated. On paper, the Norse series is a radical departure, but it never lost sight of what made Kratos a compelling character, nor the series’ mechanical roots. It identified the very core of the Greek trilogy – that fiery, unrelenting combat – and built something new atop it. And with each new game, that foundation supported new evolutions. More Spartan Rage options. Cooler weapons. A stronger variety of combat options and adversaries. The ability to play as another character for sizable chunks of the story. All these additions enhanced what came before and never distracted from the foundations that made the previous games such a success. They maintain a clear sense of identity for the series, and deepen the lore rather than annex it. That is something a follow-up, be it set in Egypt or elsewhere, must continue to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of if the rumours of an Egyptian setting prove true, whatever comes next must ensure that its evolutionary upgrades maintain what has made God of War such a success. Back in 2018, that meant a focus on combat – the new games had to live up to the standards of the Greek trilogy when it came to butchering foes. But the next God of War will surely be judged by its story, the true gemstone at the heart of the Norse duology. The development of Kratos’ character from the rage-filled monster encountered in the original series into a sombre, complex father and leader showcases how important the writing has been in making the post-2018 games such a monumental success. Whatever comes next must be built upon that strength, while also striving to make bold new changes that will (hopefully) be remembered as the pinnacle achievement of the next era of God of War.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/shadowveil-is-a-stylish-tough-single-player-auto-battler/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>One thing&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536960/Shadowveil_Legend_of_The_Five_Rings/"><em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em></a> does well is invoke terror. Not just the terror of an overwhelming mass of dark energy encroaching on your fortress, which is what the story suggests; more so, the terror of hoping your little computer-controlled fighters will do the smart thing and then being forced to watch, helpless, as they are consumed by algorithmic choices, bad luck, your strategies, or some combination of all three.</p>
<p><em>Shadowveil,</em> the first video game based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings">more than 30-year-old <em>Legend of the Five Rings </em>fantasy franchise</a>, is a roguelite auto-battler. You pick your Crab Clan hero (berserker hammer-wielder or tactical support type), train up some soldiers, and assign all of them abilities, items, and buffs you earn as you go. When battle starts, you choose which hex to start your fighters on, double-check your load-outs, then click to start and watch what happens. You win and march on, or you lose and regroup at base camp, buying some upgrades with your last run's goods.</p>

<p>In my impressions after roughly seven hours of playing, <em>Shadowveil </em>could do more to soften its learning curve, but it presents a mostly satisfying mix of overwhelming odds and achievement. What's irksome now could get patched, and what's already there is intriguing, especially for the price.</p>

<p>Some necessary disclosure: Auto-battlers are not one of my go-to genres. Having responsibility for all the prep, but no control over what fighters will actually do when facing a glut of enemies, can feel punishing, unfair, and only sometimes motivating to try something different. Add that chaos and uncertainty to procedurally generated paths (like in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/slay-the-spire-the-decades-best-deckbuilding-game-coming-to-ios-in-june/">Slay the Spire</a>),</em> and sometimes the defeats felt like my fault, sometimes the random number generator's doing.</p>
<p>Losing is certainly anticipated in&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil</em>. The roguelite elements are the items and currencies you pick up from victories and carry back after defeat. With these, you can unlock new kinds of fighters, upgrade your squad members, and otherwise grease the skids for future runs. You'll have to make tough choices here, as there are more than a half-dozen resources, some unique to each upgrade type, and some you might not pick up at all in any given run.</p>

                <p>Humble has revealed its March 2025 lineup of PC games for <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice subscribers</a>, giving members a really good selection of varied games to choose from this month. In March, you can explore the spooky Pacific Northwest, head to the stars for a cosmic adventure, and try a different take on the Monster Hunter formula.</p><p>Humble Choice is a $12 monthly subscription service that offers a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership. You'll also unlock several other benefits, like exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice March 2025 Games</h2><ul><li>Pacific Drive</li><li>Homeworld 3</li><li>Wild Hearts</li><li>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</li><li>Gravity Circuit</li><li>Sir Whoopass</li><li>Racine</li><li>Cavern of Dreams</li></ul><p>One of the big highlights this month is Pacific Drive, a roguelite caRPG where you'll venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone, a hub of science-defying activity. Strange stuff is going on in that area and you'll get to unravel the mystery of the game by roguelite runs in your station wagon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pacific-drive-pulls-off-being-unnervingly-spooky-and-relaxingly-chill-all-at-once/1100-6523113/">If you enjoy exquisitely crafted spookiness</a>, then Pacific Drive will be right up your alley.</p><p>Another great game you can check out is Homeworld 3, a grand return to the sci-fi strategy series. While there were some teething issues on launch day, Homeworld 3 has received quite a few updates and post-launch content to help whip it into shape. Tales of Kenzera: Zau is another game that you'll want to download, as this is a 2.5D metroidvania action-adventure inspired by African folklore. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-bladedancing/1900-6418212/">Not just a fun game to play</a>, it also has a touching tale about loss and grief at its core.</p><p>Monster Hunter fans will also want to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/" data-ref-id="1900-6418030">Wild Hearts</a>. Developed by Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force, the game combines Monster Hunter influences with a fast-paced crafting system, allowing you to build your way out of trouble when you face off against the fearsome beasts around you. It has a few rough edges, but it has fun combat, traversal, and building mechanics to help it stand out from other Monster Hunter-inspired games. The rest of the list includes several other interesting games, like Sir Whoopass and Racine.</p><p>As a reminder, all these games are available at no additional to Humble Choice members as part of their $12/month subscription. You can sign up now and gain immediate access to them all, and they're yours to download and keep forever. You'll also get all the other membership perks, including the Humble Vault and exclusive Humble Store discounts. As an additional goodwill bonus, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the humanitarian organization Care.</p><h2>Humble Game Bundle Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fcapcom-arcade-classics-fighter-pack&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom Classics and Fighters Pack</a> -- 70 items for $20</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdeckbuilder-bonanza&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deckbuilder Bonanza</a> -- 6 items for $20</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Findie-allies-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indie Allies 2025</a> -- 10 items for $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fpathfinder-kingmaker-bundle-from-paizo-inc-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pathfinder: Kingmaker Bundle</a> -- 52 items for $32</li></ul>

			<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotaku</a>, the San Diego-based PlayStation studio Visual Arts Services has been hit with more layoffs. This week, an unspecified number of employees were notified that their last day with the company would be Friday, March 7. The news was shared publicly by former Visual Arts Project Manager Abby LeMaster (who left three years ago for Riot Games). In a LinkedIn message, she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that 'many' friends had just lost their jobs, lamenting that Sony had just let go of developers with a lot of experience. Here's a quote:</p>
<p><em>PlayStation Studios: Visual Arts was a playground, and it was also my first job in games. I started as an intern with an Information Systems degree, unsure of where I fit in, and met some of the most incredible people. It was a place where we got to experiment, learn, and contribute to projects that defined eras of gaming. The teams there were filled with artists, engineers, producers, and creatives who poured everything they had into their work. We chased excellence, and we built things we were proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>But also, more than anything, PSVA was about the people. The friendships I made there shaped me, and I carry those relationships with me to this day. The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup. This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill, experience, and passion of the people I worked with at PSVA are undeniable.</em></p>
<p>Visual Arts had ambitious plans just a little over three years ago when studio head Michael Mumbauer <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-san-diego-studio-existing-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to work on existing PlayStation franchises using the studio's own proprietary technology. Mumbauer wanted the studio to lead development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of The Last of Us</a>, but PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst deemed the budget required too high, and Naughty Dog was once again put at the helm of the remake, with Visual Arts reverting to its usual supporting capacity. The team then also helped Naughty Dog with The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>These new Visual Arts layoffs are only the latest to hit Sony teams. Last month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on new cuts at the Technology Group. Of course, Firewalk Studios, developer of Concord, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Overall, it's a widespread disease that runs rampant throughout the whole gaming industry, between rising game development budgets and reduced growth prospects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another PlayStation studio has reportedly been hit by layoffs, with support studio Visual Arts apparently in the Sony firing line this time around.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Visual Arts was hit by layoffs earlier this week as part of "a further restructuring of Sony's US game development operations". Cuts reportedly included staff who worked on some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">recently-canceled projects</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canned live service game</a>.</p>

<p>However, Kotaku's source, whom the publication doesn't name, says the layoffs were more widespread than that, seemingly suggesting that cuts also included staff who weren't involved in the aforementioned projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-visual-arts-layoffs-days-gone.jpg?itok=HbgYrISj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-visual-arts-layoffs-days-gone.jpg?itok=_e2dW7V2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Recent PlayStation layoffs apparently include employees who worked on a now-canceled project by&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>dev Bend Studio.</figcaption></figure><p>As Kotaku points out, ex-Visual Arts associate project manager Abby LeMaster confirmed the layoffs herself <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>, saying that waking up to news of the layoffs was "tough" and that the talent let go by the studio would be "extraordinarily difficult to recoup".</p>

<p>While you might not know Visual Arts' name, it's a fairly important studio for Sony, providing development support for major studios like Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>These layoffs come after what has been a relatively difficult year for Sony. While the gaming giant enjoyed critical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials" rel="nofollow">and commercial</a> success with the likes of throwback platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony also suffered an embarrassing failure in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just a couple of weeks after launching</a>.</p>

<p>In January, Sony announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">shake up its leadership structure</a>, appointing Hideaki Nishino the sole president and CEO of Sony's interactive division. The change means that while Hermen Hulst will remain the head of PlayStation Studios, he'll now report to Nishino, rather than the two sharing CEO duties.</p>

<p>Special Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake editions can make an already seismic release greater. The remake we never thought would happen is happening, and Activision is making sure to capitalize on it by releasing several unique editions. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake</a> rumor is less a whisper and more a truth. While we’ve all been kept in the dark waiting and wondering, developer Iron Galaxy has been busy working on the remake. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-revealed-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Pro Skater 4</a> will be reimagined in 2025, and you can customize your experience with different editions.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m here to hold your hand as we idly coast along on our boards and check out the scenery. </p>

<p>As a lover of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, I don’t see a world where I’m not picking up the Digital Deluxe Edition. It’s all digital content (as you’d expect) but it includes some incredible DOOM crossover goodies—along with Early Access.

            <p>After the success of Marvel Rivals, NetEase is publishing another shooter due for release this week: FragPunk. At least, it's releasing on PC, as its console launch has been delayed without a new release date.</p>
<p>The online shooter was first revealed at last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>, showing off its unique card mechanic that alters gameplay and the environments with wacky effects.</p>
<p>FragPunk releases on PC tomorrow, 6th March, but a message from the official social media account states the Xbox and PlayStation releases need more time due to "unexpected technical challenges".</p>

<p>"Since the announcement of the game, your excitement has been truly inspiring, and we know how much you've been looking forward to launching into battle on both Xbox and PlayStation," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"However, we want to be fully transparent with you: during the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimisation and adaptation.</p>
<p>"Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the console versions will now be released.</p>
<p>However, the developer will compensate players on Xbox and PlayStation by providing all rewards up front, including in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience, and more once the game is out.</p>
<p>Any console pre-orders will be cancelled, but those players will receive in-game currency worth $10 when these versions eventually launch.</p>
<p>"This delay was not an easy decision, but we are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our players, and this additional time will allow us to fully optimise and polish the console versions for launch," the statement continues.</p>

<p>The PC release of FragPunk will include 150+ Shard Cards, 13 playable heroes (called Lancers), and seven maps to battle on.</p>
<p>FragPunk promises an alternative to Valorant - like Riot's shooter it's a five-versus-five free-to-play shooter with teams taking turns to attack and defend.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunks-card-system-ensures-its-set-to-be-your-new-favourite-valorant-competitor">hands-on with FragPunk at last year's Gamescom</a> and was impressed by both the speed of gameplay and its intriguing card system that should help it stand out from other games of the genre.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> on PC has been updated with a new Enhanced version, bundling in a range of tune-ups such as ray-traced graphics and support for AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS, new features for GTA Online, and a heaping helping of swankmobiles for your fleet of GTA cars. Existing GTA 5 story mode and GTA Online progress will carry over, and it’s all free to people who own the old version of GTA 5, which is now known as the Legacy version on Steam. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s a nice overhaul with a few downsides. One is that the game’s system requirements have also been Enhanced - you'll need double the RAM and double the graphics card memory, amongst other things. You can still play the Legacy version if you don’t have the specs for the upgrade, but Legacy and Enhanced owners aren’t allowed to play together, which threatens to drive a bit of a wedge through the community.</p>
<p>The Enhanced version also adds “kernel-based anti-cheat protections”, which may not amuse those of you who prefer it when games don’t snoop on every application you have running from the stinking bowels of your computer, or have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/according-to-experts-on-kernel-level-anticheat-two-things-are-abundantly-clear-1-its-not-perfect-and-2-its-not-going-anywhere/">concerns</a> about the cheater-rumbler software throwing up false positives or exposing your system to ransomware. But the big forum complaint, right now, is that Rockstar appear to have done away with GTA 5’s in-game text chat - possibly because these Enhancements come via the previous "next gen" update for GTA 5 on PS5 and Xbox, which obviously have different kinds of chat functionality.
</p>
<p>
There are many threads about the absence of text chat on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3240220/discussions/0/592890771319858068/#c592890771319866010">Steam</a> and Reddit. Several people have posted what they claim are screenshots of conversations with Rockstar support. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3mxmt/as_it_turns_out_the_lack_of_chat_in_the_enhanced/">One of these alleged support messages</a> acknowledges that “in-game text chat is not supported in GTA V Enhanced currently”, which suggests it’ll be addressed via patch; in the meantime, it advises people to make use of the game’s SMS features or platform level chat features. I’ve approached Rockstar myself for comment.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like picking the straws from a bale of spun gold, but in-game text chat is a feature many have come to rely on. Perhaps you have disabilities that make text chat more convenient, or perhaps you’d like to exchange salutations with randos without speaking aloud and potentially revealing your gender.</p>
<p>More frivolously, somebody’s posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3zxwx/the_newbie_took_off_before_i_realized_that_ee_had/">a tragic communique</a> about innocently boarding a plane piloted by a brand new player, and realising they couldn’t communicate with each other. Hey, perhaps there's a Netflix miniseries in this. I'll send Vin Diesel a request for comment, too.
</p>
<p>
There are also a host of other complaints related to people struggling to migrate their progress between versions. While irritating, these seem more like the usual launch-day bugs.</p>
<p>Of course, the lion’s share of disgruntled responses to Rockstar’s social media posts about the update are from people pining for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> trailer. The game remains slated for console launch later this year so it's definitely high time we had a video. Maybe even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">GTA 6 PC release date</a>, as a treat.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-pre-order-bonuses-have-been-found-on-steam.1125747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie’s next game, Marathon, has reportedly had its pre-order bonuses uploaded to the backend on Steam.</p>



<p>That’s according to the SteamDB Discord server (and reported to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3pv6f/marathon_preorder_cosmetics_found_in_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>), who noticed that that extra editions of Marathon and packages relating to pre-order bonuses were uploaded to Steam.</p>



<p>According to the information, such pre-order bonuses will include free Marathon skins that can be used in Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Such an update suggests that the game will be announced soon, and according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, he said in February that he believes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/">Bungie will reveal </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/"> in April</a>.</p>



<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play,” he said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was first revealed on May 24, 2023, with a teaser trailer revealing that the game would be a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter. </p>



<p>In June 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s gameplay loop</a>, including an experimental feature that would see players have an in-game timer controlled by their oxygen supply. </p>



<p>Marathon is scheduled to release in 2025 for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing more of Bungie’s Marathon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Eagle-eyed Dungeons and Dragons fans have spotted a fresh reference to everyone's favourite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> vampire, hidden away in the game's new Monster Manual. 
</p>
<p>
Astarion is featured in the 2025 edition of the Monster Manual - or at least, a quote from him is - as spotted by Baldur's Gate 3 fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1j0wrn4/astarion_mentioned_in_the_new_monster_manual/">reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/the-baldurs-gate-3-arization-of-dungeons-and-dragons-continues-as-astarion-gets-2-official-mentions-in-the-new-source-books/">GamesRadar</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"Darling, you are simply delicious," Astarion says, atop the Monster Manual page detailing Vampire Spawn (medium or small Undead, Neutral Evil). And this isn't the first time Astarion has popped up in official D&amp;D lore either.
</p>
<p>
Astarion previously popped up in the official D&amp;D Player's Handbook (2024 edition) as seen in an eye-catching piece of artwork for the daylight spell. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/astarion-hed.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Here, Astarion can be spotted tucked away in the bottom right corner, unafflicted by the spell's effects which have begun to burn up all his vampire spawn brethren. (Astarion canonically is immune to sunlight, thanks to the handy plot device of having his illithid tadpole in his brain).
</p>
<p>
Last year's handbook did not specifically confirm it was Astarion in the artwork, but <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/astarion-from-baldurs-gate-3-appears-in-the-2024-players-handbook.706670/">ENWorld</a> later got acknowledgement from the illustration's artist that it was an official appearance by the character, the rights to which are owned by D&amp;D maker Wizards of the Coast.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has now wrapped up work on the game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">one final patch that added in Xbox Series S splitscreen support</a>. The studio has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">now begun work on its next game</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">it won't be Baldur's Gate 4 or anything at all to do with D&amp;D</a>. Still, it's highly likely we will see a new entry in the series launch at some point - even if it is from another developer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review.1125723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You wait for ages for a bus to come along, and then two arrive at once. It’s not something you’d expect in the controller world, but GameSir are absolutely smashing things out of the park right now. Not content with the already well-featured and excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> – which we were only just able to review – GameSir has just launched <em>another</em> multiformat controller, the Super Nova. In many ways they feel like opposing sides of the same leaf, giving gamers a choice of subtly different controller designs. Well, as long as they’re GameSir controllers.</p>
<p>The Super Nova looks and feels amazing. There’s a lot to be said for a controller that you hand to someone and they immediately respond with generous oohs and aahs. The Super Nova is that controller. The weight here is just right, with enough heft to feel premium and powerful without it feeling like you’re manhandling a brick. At 263g, it shaves a little bit from the Official Xbox Controller’s 287g, which makes it less of a chore through long stints, but has enough heft that you’re not wondering what you’ve spent your money on.</p>
<p>There’s also rubberised grips that wrap all the way around both arms so that your hands feel absolutely set in place when you’re playing – here it’s definitely a step up from the Cyclone 2 which has textured plastic instead. In terms of immediate feel, the Super Nova is the new GameSir king. You’ll be even more impressed when you discover that it’s less than £50.</p>


<p>Visually, the two are distinct, but fairly similar, especially in how they both feature RGB strips running around the controller. The difference with the Super Nova is that they’re not hidden away, whereas the Cyclone 2’s strips are within the body, shining through the translucent plastic. Personally, I think the Super Nova is the better looking of the two, the LED strip providing a hard line between the body and the arms of the gamepad, but it’ll very much come down to individual preference.</p>


<p>The included charging stand continues the Super Nova’s RGB lights, and one of the nicest touches is the way that they line up and cycle as a complete circuit when you put the controller on the base. The base gives you an extra USB-A socket too, which can play home to the 2.4Ghz dongle, keeping everything neat and tidy. There’s also Bluetooth built in and wired support, meaning the Super Nova works perfectly across PC, Nintendo Switch, mobile and Smart TV platforms.</p>
<p>There are some key differences between the Super Nova and the Cyclone 2, and primary amongst them are the buttons. The Super Nova says it uses ‘silent’ buttons, but they’re fairly traditional membrane buttons across the board, including the D-pad. It’s a step down from the microswitch-equipped Cyclone 2, but they are much quieter if that’s important to you. They do feel nice and solid, and work perfectly well, and the ABXY buttons are slightly larger, making them easy to locate in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>You can also physically move them around, which is ideal if you want to swap to a Switch-centric face button layout, with the magnetic faceplate lifting off easily so that you can access the internal components. You can replace the analogue stick tops too, though there are no additional parts included in the box. I should note that you need to be in a settled environment when you take it apart, as I nearly lost my X button while popping everything out. You definitely don’t want to lose one of them!</p>
<p>As with the Cyclone 2, and the majority of the latest controller releases, the Super Nova uses Hall Effect analogue sticks and triggers. Not only are they more precise – the Super Nova’s two analogue sticks both achieved 100% accuracy on Gamepad Tester – but they will last for a very, very long time thanks to the wizardry of magnets. If you’re the kind of person who’s worn out multiple Xbox controllers and Switch Joy-Con, the Super Nova is an ideal replacement, and at this price it’s an easy choice.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of FPS – I’ve continued to be mildly average at Overwatch 2, but I’ve seen more Play of the Game awards than ever before – then the inclusion of trigger lockouts will be perfect for you. This is something I adore in controllers; shortening the length of time to activate the trigger means that your response time is quicker, and in a head-to-head shoot-off against someone without lockouts, you’re the one who’s going to win.&nbsp;The Super Nova’s lockouts are more traditional than those seen in the Cyclone 2, and as a result they feel sturdier, but at the cost of losing the microswitch element that GameSir including there.</p>

<p>You’ve also got two back paddles, and they’re well placed beneath your fingers but firm enough that you won’t activate them unintentionally. It’s easy to program these on the fly, or you can dig into this and other functions in the GameSir Connect software. Just like the Cyclone 2, I’d be slightly wary of hitting the update firmware button – there’s a known bug lurking around that soft locks your controllers, requiring a reset via the rest button on the back – but beyond that it’s a deep and extremely useable piece of software.</p>
<p>Around the back, you’ve also got a selector to move between Bluetooth connections and the 2.4 GHz dongle, and while it’s nice to have that physical action, it’s very closely inlaid into the rear of the controller, and a little tricky to activate. While the Bluetooth connection is relatively snappy, it can’t compete with the 1000Hz polling rate of the 2.4GHz dongle. It means that the Super Nova is wickedly fast, and when you add together the feel, the features and the responsiveness, you find a ‘pro’ controller in all but name.</p>
<p>At £50 – or even cheaper if you shop around – the Super Nova is incredible value for money. The clearest competition for the Super Nova is, of course, its sibling, the Cyclone 2, or indeed Gamesir’s wired offering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/25/gamesir-g7-se-wired-controller-review/">G7 SE</a>. They’re all packed with Hall Effect sticks and triggers, and various other ‘pro’ features while undercutting the standard offerings from everyone else. As much as I like them, you can’t compare a Switch Pro Controller to the Super Nova, and if you’re looking for a Switch controller in particular, Gamesir’s latest is the one you should get.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/absolum-is-the-next-game-from-streets-of-rage-4-developer-guard-crush-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Guard Crush Games, Supamonks and Dotemu have announced Absolum, a brand new fantasy brawler that is due to be released later this year. The confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, PS4 and Switch. The announcement trailer opens up with guards clamping down on those who live in this game world, until they are interrupted by two rebels, one wielding a sword and magic while the other has an axe and a gun. The visuals look sublime.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvI172bkKDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Absolum will allow you to play as one of four rebel heroes, including the sword wielder and the gun toting dwarf. The other rebels are not showcased in this trailer, but are part of the artwork. The world is known as Talamh, and it will be a world that will be different each time you play with multiple paths and changing enemy encounters on each playthrough. Dotemu has announced that a full gameplay trailer will be released in the next few months, and it is likely we will see the other two characters come in to play. Talamh is under the control of Sun King Azra and his loyal princes, who terrorise the local population.&nbsp; High Enchantress Uchawi brings the rebels together to overthrow Azra and his loyalists.</p>
<p>The rebels of Absolum are Galandra, the sword wielder you see in the trailer, and she has necromatic powers which are destructive. Karl is the dwarf in the trailer, and he is also the last free dwarf in all of Talamh. His blunderbuss gives him access to explosive moves, and his strength is ideal for close quarter combat. Brome, who is not seen in the trailer, is a wizard, and the final character, also not in the trailer, is Cider who is described as a “nimble skirmisher.”</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Streets of Rage 4 review, I wrote, <em>“Streets of Rage 4 is a must for any beat ‘em up fans, especially those with fond memories of the original trilogy. The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.”</em></p>

			<p>Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent has increased its stake in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, edging closer to Sony's shares in the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-additional-shares-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a> today, Japanese publication Nikkei revealed that Tencent has increased its stake in the company by 1.11%, bringing it to 7.97%. The Chinese conglomerate confirmed the company had increased its share in FromSoftware's parent company as part of a <em>"capital business alliance"</em> between the two parties.</p>
<p>Despite increasing its share ratio, Tencent still isn't the largest shareholder in Kadokawa. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/">December</a>, Sony and Kadokawa confirmed that the two companies had entered a strategic capital and business alliance that made Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa stock. The alliance will allow Kadokawa to realize the company's Global Media Mix strategy, which involves the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is only one of the game development studios owned by Kadokawa, but it is definitely the most popular. The creator of the Souls series is now working on an Elden Ring spin-off called Elden Ring: Nightreign which combines mechanics from the main game with roguelike elements to provide a co-op experience that has ton of potential, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo has won another lawsuit this week, this time against a pair of counterfeit sellers selling fake amiibo cards on Amazon.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Nintendo and Amazon filed a joint lawsuit against the counterfeiters for allegedly selling fake Nintendo goods, but the sellers failed to respond.</p>
<p>Now a Seattle district judge has issued a default judgement in the companies' favour, awarding over $7m in trademark infringement damages (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/533664/nintendo-7-million-counterfeit-amiibo-lawsuit-trademark-infringement">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically, Nintendo sought $705,963 against one seller through several seller accounts, $6.2m against another seller with several accounts, and $47,652 against both for a shared account.</p>
<p>"The Court finds this damages request to be reasonable, in light of the nature of the deceptive scheme, the scope of the sales, the involvement of each Defendant, as well as the need for compensation, deterrence, and punishment," court documents read. "The Court therefore awards Nintendo damages in the amounts and allocations sought."</p>
<p>Amazon shut down the sellers' accounts ahead of filing the original complaint.</p>
<p>"Nintendo utilises both internal and external resources to combat counterfeit and infringing products," wrote lawyers in that original complaint. "Nintendo works with a third-party brand protection service vendor on the detection and removal of product listings violating Nintendo's IP rights that are identified and sold in Amazon's stores. Nintendo works regularly and collaboratively with Amazon to identify counterfeit Nintendo products and to strengthen automated detection and removal of the products from Amazon's stores."</p>
<p>The news follows an announcement from Nintendo yesterday it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">successful in a lawsuit against French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which operates the website 1fichier.com. The decision was "significant" in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games, as well as for "the entire games industry".</p>
<p>Other lawsuit wins include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">against Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, which shut down and paid Nintendo $2.4m, as well as against a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">streamer who broadcast pirated games</a> last year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most high-profile legal action from Nintendo, though, is its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>. The Pokémon-with-guns game has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-32m-players-a-year-after-release-but-nintendo-lawsuit-remains-unresolved">surpassed 32 million players</a> a year after its release, but the legal case currently remains unresolved.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bad Guitar Studio’s Fragpunk is being touted as a game-changer for online shooters. Its console release date is a big talking point for PlayStation and Xbox users, so let’s check out the latest details on the launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-new-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fragpunk</a> delivers Indiana Jones-sized Short Rounds with quick battles and ever-changing dynamics. It may be a Hero shooter—taking inspiration from Overwatch and Marvel Rivals—but it has its fresh twists. Shard Cards allow players to customize their playstyle on the fly, midgame with gameplay-altering abilities.</p>



<p>It looks cool, it enjoyed a smooth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-closed-beta-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a>, and its PC release is already locked in. But what about if you’re waiting for the Fragpunk console release?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fragpunk-come-out-on-console">When Does Fragpunk Come Out on Console?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Do you take American Express? Credit to Bad Guitar Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fragpunk’s console release date has been delayed indefinitely until an unspecified date.</strong></p>



<p>The news has shocked players waiting to gear up for Fragpunk on PlayStation and Xbox. The March 6 release date is only happening for PC players now, and the developer has neglected to reveal so much as a vague release window to look forward to.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-has-fragpunk-s-console-release-date-been-delayed">Why Has Fragpunk’s Console Release Date Been Delayed?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Bad Guitar Studio provided an update on March 4 to explain the delay was due to “console compliance testing” issues.</strong></p>



<p>The explanation came via a March 4 post on the team’s official <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X social media page</a>.</p>



<p>“During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation. Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no update or timeframe is provided for a Fragpunk console release. All that’s promised is the “Team is working closely with both the Xbox and PlayStation teams to get Fragpunk into your hands as soon as possible.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>A message from FragPunk team about the delay of the launch on console platforms:</span></p></article></div>



<p>Console players who jumped on board early will be compensated at least. Players can claim a ton of engagement rewards, refunds, in-game currency, and much more.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you a disappointed PlayStation or Xbox user who was looking forward to Fragpunk’s console release? Do you think the level of compensation is enough when PC players get a huge advantage? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has reacted to online negativity regarding the upcoming Borderlands 4, stating "if you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price".</p>
<p>Pitchford's words come as part of an exchange on social media with influencer Gothalion, who also serves as audience director for publisher Midwest Games, and kicked off after Gothalion claimed Pitchford had muted a fan for raising some "very valid concerns (mild takes really)" about the next entry in the Borderlands series.</p>
<p>"His critique came from a place of love," <a href="https://x.com/Gothalion/status/1896361473586384983">Gothalion wrote</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/dont-gaslight-me-borderlands-4-ceo-randy-pitchford-begs-fans-to-be-optimistic-about-the-upcoming-fps-otherwise-well-all-pay-the-price/">GamesRadar</a>). "As will mine. Please reconsider. Do better. Make a great Borderlands, and when your longest lasting biggest supporters give feedback and worries, especially respectfully, digest it gracefully."</p>

</figure>
<p>Pitchford, however, did not take warmly to Gothalion's comments, and said the aforementioned mild takes were not a critique, but "shitty negativity that was demotivating" for the Borderlands 4 team.</p>
<p>"Want the best Borderlands? Root for us and cheer us on. If you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1896371927259980287">Pitchford replied</a>, adding he appreciates criticism and has "never been in short supply" of it.</p>
<p>"Don't gaslight me on his post," the Gearbox exec closed. "It wasn't criticism. It was pessimism. It's toxic for people killing themselves for your entertainment, so fuck that noise."</p>
<p>This is, of course, not the first time Pitchford has been vocal in defence of his studio and media online. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-randy-pitchford-defends-recent-flops-by-comparing-gearbox-to-the-beatles">the CEO compared his company to the Beatles</a>. "I wish everything [we do] could be a hit," he said, "but that is not how it works... The greatest musical act of all time, The Beatles, had a 25 percent hit rate."</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A long-running zombie MMORPG you can play in your internet browser is shutting down next week, after almost 20 years of plank-smashing and supermarket looting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urban-dead">Urban Dead</a> is closing down because a new UK law threatens hefty fines for online services (including games) that don't follow age restriction rules and other guidelines. It looks like making the game compliant with that law would be too much work for the solo web developer who's been keeping the apocalyptic servers going for this long. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Sad to have to announce that Urban Dead will be closing down on Friday 14 March 2025, due to an upcoming change in UK website legislation," said developer Kevan Davis in a <a href="https://www.urbandead.com/shutdown.html">post on the game's website</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/cult-text-based-zombie-mmo-urban-dead-is-shutting-down-after-a-full-19-years-8-months-and-11-days-because-of-new-uk-legislation/">Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p>"The Online Safety Act comes into force later this month, applying to all social and gaming websites where users interact, and especially those without strong age restrictions. With the possibility of heavy corporate-sized fines even for solo web projects like this one, I've reluctantly concluded that it doesn't look feasible for Urban Dead to be able to continue operating."</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act was passed into law in 2023 and comes into effect this year. The UK government says the act will make social media and search companies "more responsible for their users’ safety on their platforms."</p>
<p>"The strongest protections in the Act have been designed for children," an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">explainer says</a>. "Platforms will be required to prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content."</p>
<p>But the law has been criticised as a censor's charter by human rights groups <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/online-safety-bill-a-threat-to-human-rights-warn-campaigners/">such as Open Rights</a>, and big companies like Apple have complained that it has <a href="https://www.24zero.net/apple-calls-uks-online-safety-bill-a-serious-threat-to-end-to-end-encryption/">repercussions for end-to-end encryption</a>. This is a bit messy, since Apple is already in a spat with the UK government over <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">a secret order</a> they were handed by the government to hand over the keys to their encryption - but, look, none of this has anything to do with zombies. Urban Dead just seems to be collateral damage in a bigger legal brawl between the UK government and corporate interests.</p>
<p>"So a full 19 years, 8 months and 11 days after its quarantine began, Urban Dead will be shut down. No grand finale. No final catastrophe. No helicopter evac. Make your peace or your final stand in whichever part of Malton you called home, and the game will be switched off at noon UTC on 14 March."</p>
<p>Malton is the name of the big city you explore in the game. It's basically loads of blocks full of gun shops, fire stations, hospitals, malls, pubs, and other potential sources of useful items to scavenge. You can board up the windows of any building to protect against the undead. It's the only MMO I know that lets players play as zombies. I briefly wrote about waking up as a zombie and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-urban-dead">enjoying the game's refresh battles</a> back in 2017. I haven't played for many many years, but my fond memories of the game include holding out in a boarded up mall with lots of other players (and a single "pet" zombie player who muffled and groaned in <a href="https://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Guides:The_Zombie_Lexicon">a whole language that you could actually translate</a> if you took the time to examine the moans). </p>
<p>The developer doesn't write off a re-boot down the road. "If Urban Dead is ever revivified or spun off in any way in the future," says Davis on the Urban Dead news page, "it'll be announced on this website."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-to-last-30%E2%80%9340-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content.1125675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At a recent Assassin's Creed Shadows showcase event in Japan, Ubisoft Quebec Creative Director Jonathan Dumont discussed the estimated length of the upcoming open world game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1xnfk2J98Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Genki Gamer</a>, he said that the studio expects the main story to last at least thirty to forty hours, while the whole game could last more than eighty hours when accounting for all the side content.</p>
<p>That's certainly a hefty amount, although a bit less than the gargantuan Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which required 61 hours just for the main story and could last up to nearly 150 hours for a full completionist run, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the website HowLongToBeat</a>. Admittedly, Valhalla's quests and missions weren't always memorable, and gamers nowadays have loudly expressed their disdain for fetch quests and the like. Hopefully, the new installment can deliver higher quality content on average.</p>
<p>For Ubisoft, it would be an understatement to say that there's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows. The French publisher had to deal with multiple underwhelming commercial launches, including Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, XDefiant, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. The shorter spin-off game Assassin's Creed Mirage did well enough, but now Ubisoft needs a big win. It's why they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows twice</a> in a desperate attempt to improve the game and make sure it hits the intended mark.</p>
<p>Bringing players to the long-requested setting of 16th-century Japan, toward the end of the Sengoku era, the game features dual protagonists Fujibayashi Naoe and Yasuke, a shinobi and a samurai, respectively. Ubisoft Quebec has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-lets-you-stick-with-one-protagonist-for-most-of-the-game-exploration-loop-is-sherlock-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that players could stick with their preferred protagonist for most of the game if they so choose, though there will be some things that one is much better at than the other, and at some point, the game might force you to switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-off-the-improved-anvil-engine-shares-new-tech-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new version of the Anvil engine</a> delivers interesting improvements to the stealth gameplay, too. For the first time in the franchise, hiding in the shadows will actually make the player character invisible to their enemies. This means that during nighttime, every shaded spot will become a dynamic hiding spot in which the players can advance themselves further, both indoors and outdoors. Players can even destroy lit lanterns with Shurikens, creating new shadowed spots. Moreover, the dynamic weather and seasons can affect stealth as well. When it's raining, the sound covers the player's footsteps. Rain also makes changes to enemy patrols, as some NPCs will seek shelter from the rain. Seasons have an even greater effect, as some bushes/vegetation won't be there in the winter months.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to debut on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>I’ve only ever known the Suikoden&nbsp;series as the JRPG where you can recruit like a hundred different characters. I always loved the idea of that whenever I heard it, but the closest I came to actually playing them was with being tempted by the recently released spiritual successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/eiyuden-chronicles-hundred-heroes-review/">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a>. With Konami setting out to revive their entire gaming catalogue, though, it was only a matter of time before Suikoden was brought back into the spotlight. I’m thankful it was, and that this two-for-one HD remaster gave me the kick I needed to finally dive into a pair of unsurprising but thoroughly enjoyable old-school JRPGs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTLkLvgGvXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The amount of effort put into restoring and remastering these games for modern screens is immediately evident. These aren’t quite HD-2D works of art on the level of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest 3 Remake</a>,&nbsp;but they get pretty dang close. Plenty of environmental sprites has either been entirely redrawn or enhanced in 3D, with some realistic lighting or brightly glowing fires placed here and there in certain environments.</p>


<p>Despite characters being the focal point of this series, they don’t feel like they’ve gotten as much love in the process of remastering. Character sprites look nearly identical when compared to the original releases, retaining a pretty lanky &amp; blocky pixel aesthetic that ends up clashing just a bit with the much more modernised environments. Character portraits, meanwhile, are hit-or-miss. Those in Suikoden 1 have all been completely redrawn, and while some look pretty sharp many of them lack the same sharp style as the original portraits. Suikoden 2 portraits, meanwhile, are simply scaled up HD versions of the original portraits – but they’ve had a bit of their edge sanded off in the process, and a few even have bits of smudge and blur that come off looking pretty uncanny.</p>
<div id="attachment_457581"><p id="caption-attachment-457581">Suikoden 1 visual upgrade</p>
</div>
<p>The stories of these two games slot right into the classic fantasy formula. first game weaves a tale of an evil empire and a young hero poised to topple them with the help of his friends. The sequel, set a few years later, is a bit more open-ended as it follows childhood friends who get swept up in a series of fateful encounters and separations in the midst of a massive civil war. Both games, ultimately, steer you towards the same goal: recruit 108 allies to build an army big enough to conquer the big bad.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you’ll only be hanging out with up to six of your allies. Standard battles in the game are pretty traditional turn-based bouts where your crew of six occupy a set of rows based on their attack range, standing opposite enemies that have done the same. It’s pretty basic stuff, but these battles are broken up in a few refreshing ways. For these remasters new quality-of-life features let you toggle auto-battle or sped-up battles to help trudge through the slower sections of the game, but there’s also different battle types that you’ll be thrust into at times.</p>

<p>Both games feature Duel battles where just two characters duke it out in a rock-paper-scissors combat format. It’s a really cool way to add some extra stakes to the more climactic encounters in the story. Then, there are War battles. In the first game, they’ kind of like scaled-up singular encounters from Advanced Wars. In the second game, though, War battles are massive turn-based tactical RPG bouts that really test your patience.</p>
<div id="attachment_457579"><p id="caption-attachment-457579">Suikoden 2 visual upgrade</p></div>
<p>In an otherwise basic set of JRPGs, I was constantly kept entertained and on my toes thanks to the features that make Suikoden&nbsp;such an iconic and unique series. Constantly encountering and recruiting hundreds of new allies was a thrill, and any time the slightly-basic story or combat started to overstay their welcome, an epic Duel battle or a massive War battle shook things up and got me right back into the thick of it.&nbsp;Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster&nbsp;doesn’t make these old-school titles feel like brand new games by any stretch, but it’s still a surprisingly polished and easily accessible way to dive into JRPG history.</p>

            <p>
Capcom has unveiled a bustling in-game event schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, with the first oppurtunity to gain new gear available now.
</p>
<p>
Six events will go live over the next three weeks, each lasting for a week or two, with rewards ranging from new headgear to... more cheese? I guess <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">Monster Hunter Wilds is really leaning into its cheese naan meme</a>.
</p>
<p>
The schedule begins now with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-kut-ku-gone-cuckoo-event-guide-rewards">Ku-Ku Gone Cuckoo</a>, an event based in the Scarlet Forest which requires you gather special materials to obtain the Mimiphyta α headgear. This runs until 18th March.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-stalking-supper-event-guide-rewards">Stalking Supper event</a> is also now active, which rewards you for gathering more Kunafa Cheese in Windward Plains to be used on your barbecue grill. This runs until 11th March.
</p>
<p>
Upcoming quests include Tongue-Tied, running from 11th-18th March, which involves gathering Armor Spheres, and then a trio of new events beginning on 18th March.
</p>
<p>
These include Ballet in the Rain, which involves gathering Glowing Orb - Swords, Sand-Scarred Soul, for gathering Glowing Orb - Armors, and Like A Fire Hidden By Sand, where Capcom says you can obtain "the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition!"

<p>
Capcom has a <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule?utc=0">full event schedule on the Monster Hunter Wilds website</a>.

Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom announced that Monster Hunter Wilds was its fastest-selling game ever</a>, with 8m copies shipped so far.

			<p>A few hours ago, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1896969076884562078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has surpassed six million players, adding that such a scope is 'hard to comprehend' but the studio is 'incredibly thankful' to the community.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean six million users have purchased the game. That's because STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been available on Game Pass from day one, making it difficult to discriminate between real buyers and subscription users who found the game bundled in their library.</p>
<p>Still, it sounds like GSC Game World is happy enough so far. Moreover, while there has been no mention of a PlayStation 5 version, the console exclusivity <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is believed to be timed</a>. Eventually, STALKER 2 should also launch on Sony's console, opening up to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>The developer still has a long road ahead when it comes to post-launch support, anyway. The game should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to include hardware-enhanced ray tracing, official mod tools with cross-platform mod integration, and even a multiplayer mode, about which we know practically nothing so far. On top of those, there are also two upcoming expansions that were sold as part of the Season Pass, included with the Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The base game is well worth playing, if a bit too rough, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

            <p>A healthy pinch of my motivation for writing about waiter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> plate em' up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-way-of-the-tray">The Way Of The Tray</a> is so I can read your hospitality job horror stories in the comments, but I do love the energy here. It's a breathless, colourful (actual) plate-spinner that has you serve mythical dishes in the daily grind for tips from Yokai customers. You'll then invest those tips back into waiter skills and restaurant upgrades, or at least whatever petty cash is left over from paying rent.</p>

<p>I personally would not rely on the structural integrity of a layer of onigiri to support multiple clay bowls and glass bottles, but I am not a professional, nor do I have to please a clientele of demons, large spiders, and Kappas. I also personally wouldn't have written the phrase "immerse yourself in the mysterious atmosphere of Japan" in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373830/The_Way_of_the_Tray_Japanese_Restaurant_Simulator/">Steam features</a>, since all you have to do there is add an '-ese folklore' to not sound like a 17th century powder-wigged buffoon trotting out his maid in Geisha makeup for tonight's dinner party entertainment. Here are some less irksomely worded features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master the art of keeping your tray balanced: every mistake can cost you a tip. Learn to manage your time so you can serve all your guests on time and prevent them from leaving.</li>
<li>Serve unusual orders to yokai and learn all the secrets of local cuisine.</li>
<li>Develop your waiter skills to earn more tips and invest them in upgrades, and don’t forget to pay the rent.</li>
</ul>
<p>My own experience in food service includes frying up English breakfasts in a chippy cafe, temping for a catering company for weddings, and working in a Wetherspoons-grade pub kitchen (I believe the professional term is "microwave ape"). None of these were especially negative, mind. The chippy was in a popular holiday town, which led me to observe that some customers will treat any perceived imperfection as a direct assault on their perfect getaway, but I suppose the nature of limited leisure time makes solipsists of us all. As does paying six quid for a bacon roll. If I'd known you were going to be a Kappa I would have whacked extra cucumber in there, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilisation VII</a> studio Firaxis have welcomed prolific modder Sukritact on board as a tech artist, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1j3mwhr/sukritact_is_joining_the_firaxis_team/">announcing the news</a> in the grand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1j3mwhr/sukritact_is_joining_the_firaxis_team/">strategy game</a>'s Discord. Sukritact has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sukritact/myworkshopfiles/?appid=289070">storied Steam workshop history</a> of Civilisation VI mods dating back to 2017. These range from fully-animated wonders to rebalances, and their recent '<a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/sukritacts-simple-ui-adjustments.31860/">Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments</a>' has been going down well with Civ 7 players.</p>

<p>That user interface has been a point of contention since release, with Greg Costikyan saying it had "real issues" in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">review for RPS</a>. A patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-civilization-7-update-adds-a-confusing-natural-wonder-plus-tweaks-to-the-ui-ai-and-age-mechanics">released yesterday targeted some of these issues</a>, with another planned for March 25th. It also added the Bermuda "<a href="https://x.com/ayeejuju/status/1885399584622411793">nobody be getting lost over here no more</a>" Triangle wonder.</p>
<p>Modders getting the well-deserved bag can be safely considered one of the unequivocally good genres of gaming news - although someone does point out in the above linked Reddit thread that this means working to a company's schedule rather than a personal one. Still, It's always lovely to hear. Recently, Bethesda hired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> writer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/writer-on-impressive-fallout-london-mod-bags-job-at-bethesda">Stephanie Zachariadis as an associate quest designer</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/years-ago-cdpr-found-a-farmer-who-was-remaking-the-witcher-inside-the-witcher-3-brought-him-from-australia-to-poland-and-now-hes-working-on-the-witcher-4/">CD Projekt hired a mod-making Australian beetroot farmer</a> to work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Valve also have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minerva-goes-pro-valve-hires-ultra-modder">a history of snagging outside tinkerer talent</a>.</p>
<p>Firaxis certainly sound like they need additional hands on deck at the moment. Despite the game releasing under a month ago (or slightly earlier if you ponied up extra for the "my current level of expertly engineered excitement is surely an accurate reflection of my future enjoyment" edition), they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/upcoming-civilization-vii-expansion-release-dates-seemingly-leaked-by-nintendo">already rolling out the DLC</a>.</p></div>
