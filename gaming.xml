<p>Sure, there was far too much monetisation in the form of multiple different currencies, and the battles lacked a much-needed strategic edge, but for a mobile game you can largely play for free, it scratched an itch that kept me from ripping overpriced real-world packs and connected me with a lot of friends doing the same.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fonvuwm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>I’ve kept up playing since then, obtaining all One- to Four-Diamond cards of each of the 11 sets while also managing to pull each Immersive card. I’ve also reached the Master Ball rank in each ranked season. Yet despite being someone clearly still invested, my opinion on TCG Pocket has flip-flopped around like a Magikarp that can't decide if it wants to reach the water or perish on dry land. Every positive comes with a negative for this Coalossal gacha game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="38d82b098e613"><a title="Dragonite &amp; Babies" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38d82b098e613/dragonite-and-babies.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Lowell Bell / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the last year, every key feature or update developer DeNA implemented to make the collecting and battling experience better has come paired with an attempt to fleece the player base for more real-world dollars.</p>
<p>A good example of this (that later got ‘fixed’) is how you trade. TCG Pocket launched without the ability to do so — despite the name of the game — and when it did debut, it came with another new currency and restrictive rules around what cards you could trade, enticing you to spend more real-world money on packs, as gacha games are wont to do.</p>
<p>Notably, you couldn’t trade cards from the current set, and you couldn’t trade Two-Star cards or above. If your favourite Pokémon is Dragonite and you <em>really</em> want that rainbow-border Dragonite EX, better break out that credit card because the Pack Points system isn’t going to get you there unless you spend a few hundred dollars, as you couldn’t trade a friend with duplicates for it.</p>
<p>After fan backlash, DeNA course-corrected from this restrictive system. They first Axewed the trade-based currency and merged it with Shinedust. And sometime soon — perhaps even as you’re reading this — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">they promise</a> you’ll get to trade Two-Star cards while also implementing the ability to gift Diamond rarity cards to friends.</p>
<p>These changes will undoubtedly make TCG Pocket much more player-friendly, yet from my anecdotal experience, this is too little too late. Many people I know dropped it because it was far too stressful to keep up with the rapid release schedule of new cards.</p>
<p>And despite improvements to trading, I’m not sure collecting is going to get much better. The most recent set — the limited-time Deluxe Pack EX — has players both happy and angry like a Morpeko. There’s no mechanically new cards in this pack; however, every pack has an EX card within. This makes it an absolutely amazing catch-up pack for players who missed key cards in past sets.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4748a5f840705"><a title="Deluxe Pack EX All Pack Mascots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4748a5f840705/deluxe-pack-ex-all-pack-mascots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokemon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, this set is impossible to finish without spending money before it leaves the game, until some time in the nebulous future when DeNA re-releases it. They went ahead and included 353 total cards, which is quadruple a normal pack of about 75 cards. It includes reverse holo cards along with regular reprints of common cards, making most packs full of fluff for those — like me — that have kept up with their collections.</p>
<p>Worse, the cards from this set do not retroactively clear past sets despite being the same in every other way, meaning that if you want to grab those last few EX you’re missing to complete them, this pack is essentially useless.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>While my opinion on the collection aspect of TCG Pocket has soured, I’ve come to appreciate increasing strategic depth to ranked online battles. I know many don’t agree with me here, but as someone who has regularly played online TCGs since <strong>Hearthstone</strong>’s debut, I find a lot of the matches require interesting plays and choices that keep me coming back to reach Master Ball every season. DeNA has done a great job targeting issues with the battle system, such as introducing Baby Pokémon that alleviate the disadvantage of going first if you’re running a deck with them.</p>
<p>However, not everything is perfect as we’re mired in a Suicune EX and Greninja meta at the moment. DeNA does not rebalance their cards, instead choosing to power creep their older sets, which means the last pack mascot — Suicine — is dominating the meta, appearing in about 60% of my matches. Greninja is the only non-Trainer Genetic Apex card that still sees regular play. I was done playing against the blue dog and frog about a week into the September season. Even if the matches against it are often exciting, no new cards from the Deluxe Pack EX unfortunately ensured we got another month of their <em>'rain'</em> of terror.</p>

<p>Of all the people I know still playing TCG Pocket, I’m the only one who consistently climbs the ranked ladder every season. Most people just log in to rip their daily packs, check Wonderpicks, and move on.</p>
<p>Every positive change DeNA makes to TCG Pocket either comes with or is in response to a negative, still. The Mega Evolution-themed set has three packs to open instead of one or two, making it harder to collect ‘em all. But immediate trading of that set means you can grab the meta-relevant cards or cards you want to build decks for quicker, making the climb to the Master Ball rank that much more exciting as more people will have cards to stay competitive with the Wailords among us.</p>
<p>If the upcoming trading features bring a player-friendly breath of fresh air to the game, I could see myself enjoying TCG Pocket for another year or more.</p>
<p>After a full year of updates, I wouldn’t change my review score; however, it'd be a 7/10 for different reasons. Battles are far more strategic now, but the collection aspect can oftentimes feel overwhelming, especially if you’re free-to-play.</p>

<p>With additions to the trading system on the horizon, TCG Pocket <em>might</em> reach a place where it feels less like it’s a floundering Magikarp and something more like the raging Gyarados it was when it first launched. But as always with mobile gacha games, I don't have a lot of hope that potential will ever materialise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pints of beer after work in a cosy London pub. A glass of wine in the evening at a villa in the Sunset Marquis hotel, West Hollywood. A phone call in the dark outside a Chinese restaurant in Windsor, England.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three disparate scenes, all more than 5,000 miles from Sony's headquarters in Tokyo, were backdrops for a decision that helped define the PlayStation 2, Sony's landmark console that celebrates its 25th anniversary in North America today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best-selling console of all time for well-documented reasons: its massive library, its headstart on the Xbox, its mid-life price cut, and its affordability as a DVD player. But the deal that brought a trio of Grand Theft Auto games – GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas – to the PS2 before any other platform was also vital. They collectively make up three of its top six sellers. Some people bought the PS2 just to play GTA and if you didn't have one, you were nagging a friend who did. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris Deering, the then-president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, estimates the deal boosted console sales in Europe by a fifth – a huge margin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've heard snippets about this deal and about that key meeting at the Sunset Marquis before. But IGN has now spoken to four people at the centre of it all who can tell the story in more detail than ever. They reveal previously unknown twists and turns in negotiations: how Sony nearly missed out on exclusivity in the US, how Take Two got cash and a discount on production costs from Sony, and how Microsoft could've derailed the whole thing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-claude-1761233968809.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Theft Auto 3's silent protagonist, Claude, became one of the PS2's iconic characters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2D, top-down GTA games sold decently but scored middling reviews, and Deering's interest in GTA 3 was only sparked by a chance conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We used to have these company pub nights," he says. "It gave me a chance to deal with people I would never talk to and ask them some dumb questions." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He asked one such dumb question to the "very sharp" Sarah Thompson, who oversaw a Sony team evaluating third-party games. "I said: 'You seen anything?' She said: 'Yeah, GTA is looking really cool.' It put it at the back of my mind."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was actually a contractor called Andy Macoy who had first flagged a GTA 3 test build as impressive. As well as being filed in Deering's brain, it sat on the team's shortlist of games that Sony might want to secure as an exclusive at E3 2000, according to the then-vice president of publisher and developer relations at SCEE, Zeno Colaço, who was Thompson's boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering went to LA that June knowing he needed exclusives in order to win a second console generation in a row. Microsoft’s Xbox was on the horizon and Bill Gates had showed off a prototype in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They get a billion dollars a year from Windows licenses. They can do anything they want – they just have to want," he says. "How do we get out ahead of this? That was in the back of my mind. I didn't want them to come in and take away the chance of getting two console [generations] in a row. It was almost like a personal, I don't want to say vendetta, but it could have rained on my parade. So that was a hidden motivation."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sony needed it more than we did.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering and David Reeves, then head of marketing at SCEE and later Deering's replacement as president, met various publishers at a villa in the Sunset Marquis hotel. Take Two, the owner of Rockstar Games, was on the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every person at that meeting tells a slightly different version of the story. Non-disclosure agreements obscure some of the details and the intervening 25 years have clouded memories. It's not clear what was negotiated in the room and what was handled in follow-up phone calls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we know at least six people attended. From Take Two it was Kelly Sumner, who led the company outside of the USA and would become CEO in 2001, and Gary Lewis, who was COO and later president of international. From Sony it was Deering, Reeves, Colaço, John Brunning from the legal team, and possibly also Jim Ryan, who later led Sony's gaming division. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colaço claims Sumner initiated the meeting "to complain that another one of Take Two's games was getting a knock back from our content group" – the same group that had earmarked GTA 3 as a winner. He thinks that game may have been State of Emergency, which Sony thought was "gratuitously violent".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Anyway, we listened to their complaints," he says. "I explained our position and thoughts of what adjustments might be an acceptable compromise." Then, "to smooth the meeting over and throw them a bone, we asked them whether we could do an exclusivity deal on GTA and another game, with the background knowledge that GTA was doing something original".</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-cat-1761234025399.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The exclusivity deals mean Stephen Bliss' character illustrations for the "3D Universe" era of GTA games feel distinctly linked to the PlayStation brand. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner rejects this version of events. "I'm not saying we were happy about the approval process" for games, he says, but any discussion of that was not linked in "any way at all" to the GTA deal. Exclusivity would never have been used as any kind of "sweetener" for Take Two, he says, because "Sony needed [it] more than we did". (It's also worth pointing out that Deering intended to bring up exclusivity at the meeting anyway, and that Lewis, from Take Two, also says he doesn't recall what Colaço describes).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, the starting point of the offer, Colaço says, was "co-marketing" for GTA 3. Basically, Sony would match $1m of Take Two's marketing money. It offered the same deal for another Rockstar game, but he doesn't recall which one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were at least two other elements to the deal, although they appear to have been negotiated after that initial E3 meeting, likely back in the UK between Deering and Sumner. First, cash up front. Second, what Sumner describes as a "reduction on production costs". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In those days, production costs were really, really expensive," he explains. "Basically for the right to buy a disc and have it packaged and delivered to your warehouse, I think in around 2000 is about $11 per disc… And when you're selling millions and millions of discs, which hopefully we were, any reduction on that is very nice, thank you very much." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He won't say how much of a discount it was, but Deering says it was "in the neighbourhood of a couple of pounds a unit, maybe $3". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 3 sold 8.5 million copies on PS2 – which, at $3 a unit, would represent more than $25m in potential savings for Take Two and Rockstar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Two also negotiated incentives in exchange for, among other things, Sony getting the rights to sell exclusive software bundles that would include GTA, Colaço says. And as for the cash, Sumner recalls Sony agreeing to pay a "significant amount of money" up front – back then, Take Two was not the mega multi-billion dollar company that it is today, and "any millions that were coming in were gratefully received at that stage".</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We were keen to get into bed with Sony.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither side characterises negotiations as tough. "It wasn't like the United Nations, it was more, 'Would you like another glass of wine?'" says Deering. "It wasn't intense."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's very few formal meetings with Chris [Deering]," adds Sumner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It'd be a mistake to think that this deal was <em>purely </em>about money. From speaking to all sides, it's clear that these men got on well, respected each other, and shared a common outlook on gaming's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering wanted more "mature" games on PS2 to make the console more relevant to adults – Rockstar fit the mold. Take Two, for its part, knew the PS2's power could match Rockstar's creative ambitions. It also knew that Rockstar's games were edgy and, at times, controversial, so it needed a company that understood its vision and wouldn't meddle. Sony, which had experience managing stars like Mariah Carey, were ideal, says Take Two's Lewis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we were keen to get into bed, so to speak, with and work alongside Sony. And interestingly enough, they felt the same," he says. "You sit down sometimes, if you're lucky to do so, with certain people in a room and you realize, okay, we're comfortable with this deal… we knew we could work with them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everyone knew what they wanted from it," says Sumner. Sony was "massively supportive… and we just absolutely believed in what they were going to deliver."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-de-1761234429773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 3 remains culturally important to this day, and was remastered for modern consoles in 2021.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner couldn't sign the deal off alone, though: he needed his CEO and, crucially, Rockstar to agree. It felt like a "massive, massive bet" to cut off Xbox and to focus on the PS2 as a platform. "It had to be a team decision… but Sam [Houser] and the guys were like, 'Well, if we want to deliver what we really want to deliver, we can't keep on PS1. And it has to be PS2.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal for GTA 3 to have two years of console exclusivity with PlayStation was finalized with an evening phone call. "I was standing outside a Chinese restaurant in Windsor and doing the final negotiation," Sumner says. "The deal was done at eight or nine o'clock at night, out in the dark, in Windsor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does it look like a fair deal looking back? In a 2013 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article?page=3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Eurogamer</a>, David Reeves described it as "remarkably cheap". Sumner chuckles at the notion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that's in hindsight, either that or he's the best poker player in the world. He certainly squeaked a bit when we did the deal," Sumner says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were very, very happy at the time. And I think Sony were very happy as well. Yes, it was cheap from what we now know… I wish I could go back in time and renegotiate it and get a few more quid," he says, chuckling again. "[But] also, it was more beneficial for Take Two and Rockstar than we thought it was going to be. So everyone won."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering, for his part, says he does not think it was cheap, and that it was broadly in line with other exclusive deals negotiated at the time – including securing Tomb Raider as a PS1 exclusive. The concept of the deal, he says, was to "make up what they would've made by having the other versions".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn't the end of the saga. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There were conversations about doing something with Xbox. But that just didn't seem right.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal only secured exclusivity in Europe: in the US, Sony was "not as massively supportive" of it, Sumner recalls. In fact, GTA 3 could've easily launched in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive in Europe only. That would have, theoretically, allowed it to release on Xbox in the US far earlier than its eventual November 2003 arrival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The US "were ambivalent at first," Deering says. "I don't think they were focusing on the franchise, and hadn't had that same tip from their third party team on the rumoured power of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then word got out around the industry that this is going to be a good game," he says. "And finally, I think at the very last minute, the US came in and joined on. 'Can we hitchhike on this deal?'" He claims they did so "reluctantly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colaço says it may have even been after GTA 3's initial release. Sony Computer Entertainment America "only really got on board when they saw GTA’s sales impact and the relationship we had established with Take Two flourishing," he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Xbox's release approached, Sony and Take Two's partnership was tested again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has previously revealed that, in 2001, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recalls-time-it-rejected-rockstars-pitch-to-put-gta3-on-the-original-xbox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected Rockstar's pitch to put GTA 3 on the console</a>. It's not clear how an alternate version of events would've jived with Sony's exclusivity deal, but Sumner believes that, ultimately, a deal with Microsoft was "never going to happen" even if it was "ridiculously large".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were conversations about doing something with them. But that just didn't, in my mind, my memory, didn't seem right," he says. "They weren't heavy and they weren't aggressive about it, Microsoft, but… we were happy with the bed we're lying in. And there was no reason to change and also, you know, PlayStation were doing better than Microsoft at that stage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also claims Microsoft just "didn't understand what made us tick".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sony made you feel warm and in my memory, that's not what we got with Microsoft. They weren't aloof, but they just really didn't get it. I don't think they really understood the market. And they weren't certainly putting their arms around us. You do business with people you like, or you trust. And that's what we did. We just trusted [Sony], absolutely trusted them."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>He was serenading the whole hotel… And he's not a bad singer, to be fair.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That trust, and those flourishing relationships, glued Take Two and Sony together, says Lewis. "You could ring any of the senior management there and they would answer your call and they would listen to what your concern was, whether it be getting approval for the game, whether it be production and marketing, whatever it is… I was speaking to someone from Sony probably daily."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony also helped on the development side, recalls Obbe Vermeij, who was then a technical director at Rockstar North. GTA 3 famously began development on the Dreamcast, and while he was initially sad to leave it behind, Sony made the switch easy by sending 20 PS2 dev kits, which were rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony didn't lend Rockstar engineers but it did have what Vermeij describes as a "weird room full of electronics" at its London HQ, where third-party developers could test their games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They would be able to find the bottlenecks and tell you, at a very detailed level, these instructions [to fix it]," he explains. "Sony were just super supportive whenever we asked for something, they would give it to us." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering and Sumner's relationship was particularly strong. They only have good things to say about each other, and, Sumner says, still occasionally meet for beers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have very fond memories of Chris Deering singing outside my hotel in Reykjavik at four o'clock in the morning. He was serenading the whole hotel… And he's not a bad singer, to be fair." But those trips – those "jollies" – weren't nearly as important as the support Sony provided. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They really went out there to support the company...  and I hate to say, in my opinion, unlike Nintendo, unlike Xbox, and unlike Sega," he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It felt like someone putting their arm around you and saying, actually, guys, you're part of the team. I mean, it sounds like I'm in the Sony fan club. And I'm not saying that just because it's about PlayStation 2, I actually truly believe it."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/vice-city-cast-1761234168103.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The success of the GTA 3 deal led to Vice City's 12-month PlayStation 2 exclusivity.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That trust lasted far beyond GTA 3. It's not clear when timed exclusivity discussions for GTA Vice City and San Andreas began. Deering remembers the initial agreement as a "three-game deal." Sumner says each of the games was negotiated separately. Colaço says it was when SCEA joined the GTA 3 exclusivity deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was, at the very least, a renegotiation of terms following GTA 3's release, Colaço says. "Once the game came out and was a success, much bigger than anyone expected, then to maintain the arrangement the financial numbers went up considerably." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Two, he says, made the argument that losing out on sales on other platforms was becoming more and more costly as GTA's popularity surged. He says that was "partially true", but that Take Two also enjoyed being a close partner with Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So the conversations became much more about becoming strategic partners than transactional ones." That includes, he says, discussions about exclusivity for future GTA games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we don't know the terms of the Vice City or San Andreas deals, it's safe to say they were far bigger than GTA 3's. And, as we know, the exclusivity periods shrunk with each new game. Sony secured a full year for Vice City, but just seven months for San Andreas – both down from GTA 3’s two years. As time went on, the people attending meetings "changed a little as discussions were more global and the financial numbers dwarfed the original deal," Colaço says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sam Houser and others were all like, 'Oh my God, it's not doing well.'</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The impact of GTA 3 on wider gaming culture and on the PS2's sales was not immediate, nor guaranteed. Before release, Rockstar was worried that GTA 3 wouldn't cut through, Vermeij says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the last E3 show before [release], maybe six or eight months before the game came out, it had a really poor showing. People weren't really that interested. I remember the guys in New York, Sam Houser and others, they were all like, 'Oh my God, it's not doing well.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But of course, we did know that Sony were into it, and they promised a lot of marketing and they totally delivered on that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until six months after release that its success was obvious, he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Typically a game would sell well for three or four months and then it would just die out. With GTA 3, it wasn't like that. It sold okay, but then it just didn't die out. It just kept going because people told their friends and it was just picked up organically. It just kept going."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner and Lewis both say Take Two played into that by keeping the product "tight": if demand was one million units, they'd ship 600,000. "People were saying it was going to be banned. It was never ever going to be banned, but people believed that, and so what we did is we kept the product really, really tight, so when you saw it in Electronics Boutique, you had to buy it, because if you didn't buy it they may not be here tomorrow,” Sumner says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto was soon a phenomenon with cultural cache. Sumner, who had moved to New York, was called onto primetime TV shows to defend GTA's violence. He also recalls putting a music budget together of $600,000, only for Tommy Matola, the head of Sony Music Entertainment, to say he'd do it for free. "He said, 'I will get you the tracks, I just want to release the CD.' That was the power of Grand Theft Auto."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lewis recalls the joy of success following GTA 3's release. "You get a sigh of relief, I think is fair to say initially, and then this euphoria, because it keeps happening. We really had arrived when these products continued day in, day out, to sell… every 100,000 new PS2s we could pretty much say, 'Well, we got to sell another 10,000 GTA 3s.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's impossible to say exactly how much GTA exclusivity contributed to the PS2's success, but everyone agrees it helped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course they would have been successful [without it],"  Sumner says. "Would they have been as successful without Grand Theft Auto? Probably not, because the amount of coverage and the desirability of that product just sucked people in at a ridiculous rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sony delivered a great platform but it's a piece of plastic unless you have something like Grand Theft Auto on it and that was fundamental to people's understanding or awakening to the opportunities, cultural opportunities that the PlayStation could deliver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering adds that, in Europe, "all things considered, recognising and trying to be self critical and not inflating everything, we probably did 20% more than we would've without it, at least through PS2 and 3."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not bad for what started as evening drinks at a Los Angeles hotel. "They came to the Sunset to complain," says Colaço. "They went out with $2m they weren't expecting. And we did the best exclusivity deal of all time!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Samuel Horti is a journalist with bylines at the BBC, IGN, Insider Business, and Edge. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-sony-secured-gta-as-a-ps2-exclusive]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publisher Krafton has declared itself an "AI-first company", announcing a move to "place AI at the centre of problem solving" via a "complete" company reorganisation.</p>
<p>The megacorp outlined its "transition to an AI-first company" in a Korean-language <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">statement</a> posted to the official website that detailed the goals of its new strategy to "prioritise AI as a central and primary means of problem-solving", "fostering change in individuals and organisations, increasing company-wide productivity, and accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth".</p>
<p>"Starting today, Krafton will automate work centered on Agentic AI and fully implement an AI-centered management system where members focus on creative activities and complex problem solving," said Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han, as translated by machine. "We will leap forward as a company that promotes the growth of members and expands the organisation's areas of challenge through AI."</p>
<p>As part of this commitment, Krafton's earmarked around $69.7 million (100 billion Korean won / £52.3 million) to invest in a GPU cluster, and support the multi-stage tasks required for "sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning". This, Krafton believes, will serve as a foundation for accelerating its AI tech, which it hopes to complete and have up and running in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>Another $20.8 million (30 million Korean won / £15.5m) will also be invested in its workforce to train its staff to use AI tools.</p>
<p>It'll be through this new infrastructure that Krafton believes it will strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services.</p>
<p>Krafton's position is not an outlier in the industry. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars, Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> has used AI tool Stable Diffusion, and even <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> has admitted experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>

Hard on a good day, Medium when my friends were over, Expert once and then never ever again. That was my <em>Guitar Hero</em> sweet spot. And for years, it seemed like everybody had one. The plastic guitar controllers became a staple of living rooms everywhere, and the songs — from big bands, small bands, and bands that didn’t even actually exist — became huge hits. Long before TikTok was the most important thing in music, getting your track on a <em>Guitar Hero</em> setlist could change your life forever.</p><p>For <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/versionhistory">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a><em>, </em>we go through the whole history of <em>Guitar Hero. </em>The story begins in arcades in Japan, travels to an unlikely pair of companies in the US, and nearly falls apart entirely before becoming an enormous hit. For a few years, <em>Guitar Hero </em>was as big as any game you could find, before it began to slowly fade into the background. The game may not be around anymore, but you can still find its legacy in some pretty big-name videogames.</p><p>Hosts David Pierce, Ash Parrish, and Chris Grant all lived through various parts of the <em>Guitar Hero </em>story. They gather at the <em>Version History</em> roundtable to talk about the franchise’s many precursors and influences, the E3 conference that became the franchise’s breakout hit, the eventual rise of Rock Band, and how <em>Guitar Hero </em>eventually lost most of its luster. We also bust out the axe for the first time in a long time, to see who’s still got it.</p><p>This is the fourth episode of <em>Version History. </em>(The first three were about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/792339/version-history-podcast-hoverboards">hoverboards</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/798692/how-blackberry-messenger-set-texting-free">BBM</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/802307/sony-watchman-tv-version-history">Sony Watchman</a>).

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The PlayStation 2 is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, October 26, 2025. Below, we remember the diversity of its library, the qualities that have lived on beyond it, and the ones that were exclusive to that moment in time.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In a certain light, games are more expansive than they have ever been. Forums like Itch proliferate game jams and niche sub-cultures, and give aspiring developers a place to share their work. Steam is home to a wider catalogue of games than has ever been available on any home console. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">The diversity of the games in these places is under direct threat</a>, but is by no means defeated.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, if one wanted to experience the medium of video games in all its breadth on just one platform, a PlayStation 2 might still be the best bet.</p><p dir="ltr">The diversity of the PS2 forms a striking contrast with its counterparts released during the same period. The Nintendo GameCube has more than a few bonafide classics, but the majority of them were developed in-house. You will always know Microsoft's original Xbox better as the source of Halo-fueled college LAN parties and Xbox Live hangouts for any other game you could play with it.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2, on the other hand, is host to a set of video games that stretch beyond their borders and feel, somehow, barely associated with the console that first housed them. It carried Grand Theft Auto to becoming the biggest video game franchise on the planet. The console is tightly tied to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in my mind, even though those games also came out on the GameCube and Xbox. It was the origin point of Kingdom Hearts. It kickstarted Persona's explosion of popularity in the US and Europe, paving the way for Metaphor: ReFantazio. It is hard to understate the PS2's role in popularizing the medium of games and setting the course for what it would become.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590777-61pete6v4vl._ac_uf1000%2C1000_ql80_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590777" data-ratio="0.656" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590777-61pete6v4vl._ac_uf1000%2C1000_ql80_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590777"></a><figcaption>The humble, classic PlayStation 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590777-61pete6v4vl._ac_uf1000%2C1000_ql80_.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It also was host to the unusual and unique. Rule of Rose is still one of the strangest and most profound survival horror games ever, and stands up strong against the competition of the time, which includes unassailable classics like Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4. It was home to Drakengard, a still disturbing and grueling journey through dark fantasy hell. Ico and Shadow of the Colossus are still stealthily influential, shaping The Last of Us and God of War (2018) alike. Yet, they have a grandeur and a magic those games cannot capture, a poetic spareness that feels tied to the PS2's architecture. If you play Shadow of the Colossus on an original PS2, you can feel the console straining against the ambition on display. That fact enhances its majesty, it does not strangle it.</p><p dir="ltr">On the PS2, Katamari Damancy--a gonzo, existential toy--could find a massive audience, while Silent Hill 2 and Fatal Frame III: The Tormented pushed the medium towards a maturity it still struggles to find. Games like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty questioned the foundations of the medium well before BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line tried their hands at metafiction. Of course, the PS2 was a product of all that had come before. Still, the breadth of what it sets up and anticipates is astounding.</p><p dir="ltr">All this, though, takes for granted the distance I have now from this time period. I am not reading about interesting games from Japan that will never be ported over. I am not strolling down to my local store, only to find the shelves populated with cheap tie-in games and money-grubbing sports titles. I am not an aspiring game developer, attempting to make my way into the industry and discovering how hard it is to make something that is truly yours. I am someone who has played most PS2 games by borrowing them from friends, picking them up on the cheap from a mom-and-pop game store, or through extralegal means. I can now play English translations of those games that never made it to America. My wistful utopian gaze at the PS2 is a side-effect of revisiting it now. Plenty of my grips with the video game industry have their roots on the PS2. As I am typing this, unique and startling visions are just a click away. Why feel nostalgic at all?</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">The PS2 was far from the last time video games were good. But it was the last time mainstream games felt like they were actively and collectively pushing new ground beyond pixel counts.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">One reason is that the PS2 represents a time when few console games were aspiring to take over your life. The lack of ubiquitous internet connections on consoles meant that only a scant few could offer continual online updates. Massive online sagas like Final Fantasy XI and Phantasy Star Online were exceptions that proved the rule. Even they did not have the innumerable hooks into your wallet and your life that are commonplace across free-to-play online games now. The roots of that are, of course, in PC gaming. But now it is everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 also got way cheaper over its lifecycle. For a time, the PS2 was cheap enough it became ubiquitous. It is still the best-selling console of all time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/04/playstation-2-manufacture-ends-years?INTCMP=SRCH" rel="nofollow ">still selling over a million units</a> in the fourth quarter of 2012, just a few months before it was discontinued, at the very end of its life. For years after, games like FIFA and Final Fantasy XI were still regularly launching new entries on the PS2. It is <a href="https://www.theenemy.com.br/playstation/playstation-2-terceiro-mais-popular-brasil" rel="nofollow ">still one of the most popular consoles in Brazil</a>, when modded models running pirated games reign supreme. That fact makes Sony's pivot into expensive, premium hardware with the PlayStation 3 all the more baffling and heartbreaking.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, the PS2 was a device that was relatively cheap, had a gigantic and diverse library, and existed on the cusp of a new online era it both predicted and eluded. The PS2 was far from the last time video games were good. But it was the last time mainstream games felt like they were actively and collectively pushing new ground beyond pixel counts. For much of the PS2's lifecycle, even mainstream games felt expansive, strange, and daring. That's worth celebrating, and worth mourning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EGX and The Death of the UK Gaming Expo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The United Kingdom’s relationship with the video game expo scene has crumbled. Once upon a time, the nation boasted showcases like the Insomnia Gaming Festival, WASD, and EGX, but they’ve all disappeared into the shadows over the years.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival went bust (and is trying a half-hearted resurgence), WASD shut down, and EGX has become a pitiful, almost unbranded corner in the larger MCM Comic Con in London. I attended EGX over the weekend, and I’m sad to say that it’s no longer worth keeping alive.</p>



<p>EGX’s disappearance marks the death of the UK gaming expo circuit.</p>



<h2 id="h-uk-gamers-are-left-to-dream-hack">UK Gamers Are Left to Dream(Hack)</h2>



<p>Next year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">DreamHack returns</a> to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>ten years</strong>, which is a saving grace of sorts for gamers across the territory. In some places, the courageous efforts of more grassroots events like EPIC.LAN are trying to get some wheels turning, but the most iconic expos in the business have now faded into nothingness.</p>



<p>In 2024, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomnia-gaming-festival-review/">Insomnia Gaming Festival</a> imploded after 25 years of entertaining visitors, thanks to financial woes brought on by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s trying to make a grand return in 2025, but <strong>it’s not looking good</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>One of the final Insomnia Gaming Festival events, and while it was bustling, nobody knew it was about to collapse.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Also in 2024, the WASD showcase, a more intimate event in London that was one of my favorite events in the world, was shut down as the event’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-scene-crumble-wasd/">organiser entered liquidation</a>.</p>



<p>Now, I’m sad to report that EGX is done and dusted.</p>



<h2 id="h-farewell-egx">Farewell, EGX</h2>



<p>Formerly known as the Eurogamer Expo, EGX was once the shining star of the UK gaming scene, a monumental event that drew international acclaim and hosted a showfloor featuring the biggest names in the business.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This was EGX in 2014 after a rebrand from ‘Eurogamer Expo’. It was a massive event that was once seen as the UK’s E3.</figcaption></figure>







<p>The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t kind to EGX, but in the years that followed the devastation of the virus, EGX seemed to be getting back on an even keel. That growth has ebbed away into nothing, and EGX is now an unrecognizable corner of the larger MCM Comic Con event.</p>



<p>I attended EGX (for the last time) this year, and baulked at what was on display. It was almost impossible to spot any EGX branding, and what I did find was a few scattered indie games and a lone LAN area featuring a few rigs with a mix of playable titles on them. No big names, no exclusive demo opportunities, and almost <strong>nothing </strong>in the way of gaming activations.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The cracks in EGX started showing in 2023 (Image Credit: Later Levels Blog)</figcaption></figure>







<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">EGX and MCM joined forces</a>, but the showcases were separated, and EGX still enjoyed a standalone profile that was represented in the branding of the event. This year, EGX has all but disappeared, leaving MCM standing tall – but even that has issues.</p>



<p>As I walked around MCM, I was greeted by vast swathes of market-style stalls selling anime body pillow covers, mystery bags, animatronic furry tails, AI-generated art prints, and plastic toys aplenty. Amid a sea of half-baked cosplays and bored-looking event employees, I found none of my people; the gamers had failed to show out for EGX, what little of it there was.</p>



<h2 id="h-barely-an-expo">Barely an Expo</h2>



<p>The PR folks backing the event were offering me nothing but film and TV opportunities, and despite there being the likes of Troy Baker, Ben Starr, Chris Judge, Doug Cockle, Neil Newbon, and Elias Toufexis in attendance, nothing came up in a gaming capacity.</p>



<p>I made a conscious effort to request <strong>some kind of connection </strong>from the staff running the meet and greet area, and was palmed off with a ‘Sorry, they don’t have time for that,’ by a go-between messenger of an employee who failed to get me any traction from a nearby manager. I should stress that the manager who had ‘no time’ for me was plainly standing on the spot doing nothing.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know you’re in the good times <strong>when you’re in them</strong>. This was one of the first Eurogamer Expos in London</figcaption></figure>







<p>With no games to play, no big-named exhibitors occupying the show floor, and there being nothing in the way of gaming activations, I was reduced to wandering the stalls and trying to get excited about merchandise (spoiler alert: <strong>I didn’t</strong>).</p>



<p>The panels were visited by a half dozen people every time someone was on the stage, the security staff were lacklustre and weren’t doing their job properly, and the busiest portion of the event seemed to always be the ‘food court’.</p>



<p>I can see EGX vanishing entirely next year, and while MCM will persist, it too has been reduced to something almost unworthy of a spot in your calendar. All eyes are now on Gamescom, an utterly phenomenal event that continues to expand year after year. I’ve been to Gamescom twice and can stress that it’s the <strong>ultimate event </strong>in the world for gamers, and I just praise that it’s only a short flight away for me.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, gamers around the world can still enjoy events like Summer Game Fest, PAX, DreamHack, Tokyo Game Show, and other localized, regional events. If you want a regular expo in the UK, you’re out of luck and will need to travel.</p>



<p>Do you agree that the United Kingdom needs to do better in the gaming space? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Overall reception was positive, with many praising its continued gameplay and intriguing storyline, though some criticism was made toward the game's high difficulty and limited multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Its the west vs. Japan this week, so let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:192886,174452 @ 1761493148 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="727ea50c27067"><a title="Prime Echoes - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/727ea50c27067/prime-echoes-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? It showcases Samus in a pretty cool action pose, while in the top left, we can see U-Mos, the last remaining Luminoth on the planet Aether. In the bottom right, meanwhile, we can just about make out the Ing, and this makes for a lovely little representation of the light and dark shifts we see in the game. Lovely stuff.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="df0b1e0b514c2"><a title="Prime Echoes - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0b1e0b514c2/prime-echoes-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach is interesting, not least because it contains an odd little release date advertisement over on the right. Why..? Who knows. Otherwise, this is mostly a showcase of Samus herself, however the change in colours as we move toward the right indicate the encroaching presence of Dark Samus.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's also called 'Dark Echoes' here, for reasons!</p>

<p>Give Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken a new look</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>McDonald's Japan recently teamed up with Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> series to offer a new range of burgers.</p>
<p>If you're not able to make it to Japan in time to taste test each one, this might be the next best thing. The global fast food restaurant is now offering free codes for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> which unlock "McDonald's EX" colours for certain characters. This includes different colours for select Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken outfits.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c5375a50981e"><a title="McDonalds Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c5375a50981e/mcdonalds-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom, McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's each code via the McDonald's Japan social media account. To unlock each colour in the game, you'll need to navigate to the options menu and scroll down to "Input event code". From there, you can redeem each outfit colour.</p>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ryu)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>M3L4-WJAK-8FCH-6AYV</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Chun-Li)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>CDU9-BBPC-DNQU-98M9</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ken)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>LFCU-8RYT-7MP9-RH8F</li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo Life can confirm these codes can be redeemed in local copies of Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2. You can redeem these codes on other platforms as well. Just keep in mind, to access these colours, you'll need to have unlocked or purchased the specific outfit for each character.</p>
<p>These codes can be redeemed until <strong>12th December 2025</strong>. There's also a McDonald's EX colour for M.Bison, but this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1ogaq3r/comment/nlfd6qe/">apparently a gift</a> region-locked to Japan.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 arrived alongside the Switch 2 in June. You can find out more about it in our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

Does that mean I can play co-op with a friend who’s on PS5 while I’m on Xbox or PC?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yup.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Finish the multiplayer thought. What do you mean by “sort of” with multiplayer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name suggests, this is campaign-only. When I asked about why they’re not also remaking Halo 1’s fantastic multiplayer in Unreal Engine 5 – think about how glorious Blood Gulch and Hang ‘Em High and Sidewinder would look in UE5! – Game Director Greg Hermann told me, “Right now we’re just focused on the 25th anniversary and the campaign here.” Executive Producer Damon Conn added, “Halo Infinite and [Halo: The Master Chief Collection] provide really great experiences for multiplayer.” Which is true…though that doesn’t help PS5 owners very much. Unless… </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does this pave the way for Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite to get ported to PS5 to get PlayStation players caught up on the series?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to check back on that one. Conn said, “There is an opportunity for us to grow the fanbase. We’re bringing the most players to Halo ever. So that growth is what we’re truly interested in. And this paves the way for future stories and Halos.” So…maybe?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Will Campaign Evolved be a full-price game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked but didn’t get an answer. Personally, $50 feels right to me without proper multiplayer, but Microsoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><u>already tried</u></a> to raise its first-party game prices to $80 this year, so I’m probably being naively optimistic with that $50 thought. At least there’s new single-player content here, though.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-03-1761260005068.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you just say “new single-player content”?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes! I didn’t get any details beyond the very basic description: Campaign Evolved will include a three-mission prequel story arc revolving around Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. I asked if those missions will be available straight out of the box or if they’ll need to be unlocked, perhaps by completing the campaign. Halo Studios did not have an answer for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any gameplay changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, lots of little ones, actually. Vehicles are now destructible and they can be hijacked, as they were in every subsequent Halo game after Combat Evolved. You can also now pick up and wield any weapon the enemies can, which means you’ll have access to the Energy Sword, among others, in this campaign. The Warthog has four seats now (the extra one is on the back, like riding on the lowered tailgate of a pickup truck), and you can pilot a Wraith tank. I didn’t get to see any of the Flood in the chunk of The Silent Cartographer mission I played, but Halo Studios says they’ve implemented dismemberment for Flood enemies. The team also told me that “level design has been thoughtfully updated” to smooth out pain points. Presumably they meant the Library, but they didn’t specify. Also, the cinematics have all been completely redone, with new mocap and freshly rerecorded dialogue from Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-04-1761260005069.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Any other updates?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other notable one: Skulls! Halo Studios is adding Skulls to Campaign Evolved, and lots of ‘em. The most Skulls ever in a Halo campaign, apparently, and the total number is “dozens.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does it still feel like Halo in Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my brief experience so far, I’d say yes.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-x-south-park-collab-coming-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1335118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed that a Fortnite collaboration is coming with <strong>South Park</strong>, the animated show that has been running since the late 1990s. On social media, a claim emerged alongside a source, with the uploader suggesting that someone <strong>at Paramount </strong>corroborated the leak.</p>



<p>Fans quickly busied themselves imagining how it would work, given that South Park characters are fairly diminutive in stature and stand all of about a few feet tall.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://xcancel.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SamLeakss claimed</a> that South Park is coming to Fortnite in a crossover event.</p>



<p>Far from being the most unlikely thing in the world, players have accepted that this is gospel and have started assembling theories to explain how the collab would work. One user quickly shared an outfit that <strong>might just work</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others suggested that Epic Games would be throwing Cartman into a Mech Suit, while others demanded the arrival of Mr. Hanky as a Back Bling item. Those familiar with the South Park universe pointed out that ‘anime versions’ of the characters could be used, but that’s perhaps a little too niche to be a commercial success.</p>



<p>We know nothing beyond the original claim, unfortunately.</p>



<p>In recent Fortnite news, it was revealed that the developers of the Roblox game ‘Steal a Brainrot’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steal-a-brainrot-developers-sue-fortnite-copycat/">are trying to sue</a> Fortnite UGC developers who have allegedly ripped off their creation. This is being taken pretty seriously, as Steal a Brainrot has become one of the most popular Roblox games in record time in recent months.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>The Simpsons </strong>are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/">coming to Fortnite</a> with a themed map.</p>



<p>Do you want to see any particular South Park characters surface in this collaboration with Fortnite? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent YouTube video has revealed 40 minutes of gameplay from Wreckreation, the open-world sandbox racer. Eagle-eyed gamers spotted the upload and have been poring over the gameplay, which shows a halfway-decent racer with destruction elements and arcade-like racing mechanics.</p>



<p>Wreckreation is set to drop on October 28, and I’m hoping for a solid day-one patch, as there are more than a few bugs in the gameplay video uploaded by ‘Flotutu’ on YouTube.</p>



<h2 id="h-burnout-in-the-big-2025">Burnout in the Big 2025</h2>



<p>We’ve not seen a new Burnout game for more than 15 years, which feels pretty harrowing. Once upon a time, Burnout offered a high-octane, energetic racing experience punctuated with visceral crashes and takedown systems.</p>



<p>Wreckreation comes <strong>from the creators </strong>of the Burnout series, and it’s an all-new adventure set in a massive open-world map with sandbox mechanics. The game is designed to be pretty open-ended, offering multiplayer gameplay, stacks of customization, and some construction features that allow you to flex your imagination.</p>



<p>Here’s the video featuring the 40 minutes of Wreckreation gameplay that was uploaded recently:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WRECKREATION🚓 v1.1 Gameplay Découverte FR en 4K sur PS5 🎮 Le Burnout où TU construis tout ! 🏗️" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taEd4HPhN_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As the gameplay unravels, prospective fans will spot a few bugs involving the game’s physics and destruction-based elements. At one point, the player crashes into a truck and glitches inside it, clipping like crazy until the game forces a cutscene.</p>



<p>It’s relatively safe to assume that a day-one patch will drop on October 28 alongside the launch of the game to address some of these lingering issues. That’s the problem with playing a game early; it’s often not representative of the final product.</p>



<p>It looks good enough, though. It’s mostly unlicensed and focuses more on high-speed, arcade action than realism, but that’s what people <strong>want </strong>from former Burnout developers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 RedSec Battle Royale will only be available in Duos and Squads at launch, one insider claims. Once known as Firestorm, we reported that it has changed its name to RedSec and will be shadow dropping on October 28th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, another story has emerged that may confirm a pretty interesting addition to the mode. While nothing is yet confirmed, the leaker in question has leaked many details about the upcoming mode, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the name</a> and mode itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-duos-and-squads-are-only-team-options-for-battlefield-6-redsec-claims-insider">Duos and Squads Are Only Team Options for Battlefield 6 RedSec, Claims Insider</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST 🚨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?t=p0lnGa3QMgZbPQs634JShw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, which we reported on yesterday for the name RedSec, they claim that Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode will only be available in Duos and Squads. That means only groups of two and groups of four will be the only formations playable. Fortunately, the insider claims it will only be for launch, so future builds may expand that number. As they point out, the 100 player count could be made of 50 teams of two and/or 25 teams of four.</p>



<p>With 100 players, it’s sure to be quite the spectacle. The popularity of EA’s military shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has only grown</a> since its release earlier in October. While the surprise shadow drop isn’t going to be exactly how they may have planned it, it’s no doubt going to hit big. Other titles like Fortnite and Call of Duty have done the genre, so it’s natural that Battlefield is going there. Still, it may be a bit disappointing for some who wish to go in by themselves or with a group of five or more.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Duos/Squads matching in Battlefield 6: RedSec? Do you think it’s true? If so, have you already decided who you’ll venture out with?

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMOs</a> are a strange facilitation of games because they are, ostensibly, dead on arrival. Not dead in the sense of "lol dead game," that exact comment you see littered in the comments of articles, videos etc. about literally any online game, no matter how popular it is. Dead in the sense that it will die, as all things do, because one day the servers will go down and there will be no (legal) way to play it anymore. I put the legal in brackets there because there are many a fan effort that allow you to play a range of "officially" dead MMOs, but what would a game about a Frankensteinian revival of such a thing look like? Probably, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gorgons-garden">Gorgon's Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Gorgon's Garden, we go back to the year 2008, weirdly, personally, probably the last year I spent regular amounts of my time playing an MMO. It's a random summer day, and you are trawling through Hypogeum.net, a resuscitated version of it anyway, a fictitious forum all about an MMO called Gorgon's Garden, now defunct due to a majority of the game being sealed away by a digital currency that no longer exists.

<p>
In practicality, the game is not the game, "Gorgon's Garden," but the game, Gorgon's Garden. It is you, hanging out on your computer, in what looks to be the family computer room - you can see the edges of the computer screen, hints at a room beyond the bevels fully revealed in a reflection when the screen goes dark. You can browse that fake forum, read cringey posts from people of all ages, learning tidbits about their lives, and importantly, find a tool from a notorious hacker that bypasses that dead digital currency. The world of Gorgon's Garden opens up to you once more.
</p><p>
It's mostly quite simple, you can only look left or right, though you can move in any direction. Attacks are limited to the swing of a sword and one spell, and as you kill enemies you level up, which doesn't do much but increase your health.
</p>
<p>
As you delve further and further into the game, or perhaps dive is the right word, it starts to fall apart, the forum acting as a hub of secrets pushing you further down the rabbit hole. What starts as something silly moves towards something genuinely a bit unsettling, and I'll stop there because the whole thing is short, and free, and given the season, you've not got much reason to not try it out yourself.
</p>
<p>
If you need further convincing, Gordon's Garden comes in part from Feverdream Johnny, developer of one of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orbos-odyssey-is-psychonauts-meets-sonic-adventure-and-you-can-shoot-your-character-like-a-bullet">weirdo platformers Orbo's Odyssey</a>. Go on, give it a go, remind yourself of the horrors of niche forums and your favourite dead MMO, there's no better time for it. You can pick it up on <a href="https://feverdreamjohnny.itch.io/gorgons-garden">Itch.io</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just like the seasons, everything changes in the Jwar Isles. These developments are reflected in the Cycle Decks, and we've been given a first look at some of the cards in the next. In this article, we'll exclusively reveal 5 new cards from the <em>Bushido</em> Consequences Cycle Deck, which is available to preorder now.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.

<h2>Seasonal Changes</h2>

<p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the Weeping Sky Cycle Deck before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p>

<ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li>
	<li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li>
	<li>Enhancements, are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li>
	<li>Themes, offer new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li>
</ul><p>We don't know the full breakdown yet, but there are usually a few faction-specific cards, along with Ronin cards that can be used by all. GCT has stated that the newest factions, such as Awoken, will receive dedicated cards in upcoming releases like Kuna, rather than in this cycle deck. This allows them to focus on fully developing these factions, however, Awoken players can still incorporate Ronin cycle cards into their warbands.</p>

<p>Below we reveal 5 cards from the new cycle deck, with comments on their design and lore from the GCT Studios team ahead of our own thoughts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-2.jpg?itok=SqoK0GN5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-2.jpg?itok=4GLiMHap 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>New Eagle Army</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Amidst the mystical upheaval in the celestial realm, it's vital to anchor the narrative through the eyes of the Jwar Isles' people. The Shiho Clan has been quietly rebuilding its power base since Hiroto's return. Though they lack the resources to field a standing army like the Prefecture of Ryu, they’ve uncovered pockets of Ashigaru veterans, disciplined fighters whose loyalty, training and battlefield organisation remain intact. These seasoned warriors are well-suited to open combat, a necessity if the Shiho are to reclaim their former influence.</p>

<p>Theme cards play a pivotal role in shaping a faction’s identity, unlocking fresh warband configurations and tactical possibilities. The New Eagle Army theme exemplifies this. Reflecting the elite band of Shiho Ashigaru, once the envy of the land, these soldiers gain powerful advantages when managing Virtue Tokens, making them reliable in both melee and ranged engagements.</p>

<p>Strategically, the Theme enhances warband efficiency by offering free Warband Terrain &nbsp;and / or Enhancements, along with cost reductions for Ashigaru profiles. While the Theme forges the Shiho’s hallmark flanking warfare, it introduces a compelling “take and hold” playstyle, rich with nuanced micro-movements that the faction is celebrated for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Shiho player, I'm looking forward to trying this out. Even as a Wolf player, it reduces the cost of the Wolf Ryoshi and Spears, and adds in the free Terrain and Enhancements. It might just pull me away from my Open Rebellion theme!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-3.jpg?itok=B-E4Hiz3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-3.jpg?itok=Tbxf8TtV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Consequences of Kiyohara</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Sojobo’s machinations continue to unfold, and the stakes have never been higher. Having already fractured an Asura, the act that drew the gaze and anger of Rajin, he has now unleashed the Awoken to keep the heavens turning, but at what cost? One thing is clear: desperate times demand desperate measures.</p>

<p>From a gameplay perspective, Sojobo has fallen out of favour with the Kami and is now relentlessly struck by lightning, a punishment few could endure. Even a king, it seems, is not immune to the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>So why include the card in your warband? Despite the divine backlash, Sojobo's card offers a substantial cost discount, making him a compelling choice. This allows players to field a high-value defender at a low cost, unlocking new possibilities for list-building and tactical flexibility. It’s a risky play, but one that could pay off handsomely for those bold enough to use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sojobo is a 24-cost Ronin that can join&nbsp;Shiho Clan, Temple of Ro-Kan, and The Descension warbands and is a very effective fighter who can make it harder for ranged attacks across the entire battlefield, and also push units away from them. As the team says above, reducing their cost to 19 at the risk of them taking damage each turn could really pay off.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-4.jpg?itok=dxs-AL5j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-4.jpg?itok=VY_9KwqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Yokai Corruption</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>After the great Tsunami, rising waters forced the spiders from their hidden lairs into human settlements and forests, spreading dread wherever they crept. Once again, the common folk came to fear the spider’s presence and so Grandmother, and her corrupted followers, took on this form, one that mirrors her essence and the spirit of her death-bringing cycle.</p>

<p>Now, Sojobo must confront the embodiment of the returned Thirteenth Cycle. If he is to fulfill his mission, he cannot avoid this malevolent force. With such powers unleashed, even the Yokai are being reshaped and twisted into new forms that reflect the corruption of nature itself. The Cult of Yueri stands as a chilling benefactor to this transformation.</p>

<p>This card presents a true conundrum. Your Yokai will blaze with additional Ki Tokens, surging with unnatural energy throughout the game. But this power comes at a price: the stolen energies will eventually consume them. It’s a classic twist on risk-reward mechanics, and one that many Yueri players will find irresistible, offering bold new strategies for those willing to gamble with fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding this to a Yokai unit with a high Ki empowers them more and means they'll survive longer, but each time they use a Ki feat, they'll drop by 1, which means they might not be as effective late game, but if you want to storm them into combat, and watch them burn out taking down enemies, then this Enhancement for the Cult of Yurei is glorious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each cycle is marked by a celestial Asura, a divine embodiment of that cycle’s spirit and nature. For generations, it was believed there were only twelve cycles, but ancient calendars and forgotten dates revealed a hidden truth: a missing cycle, long obscured, whose absence caused the Heavenly misalignment that Sojobo now seeks to correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the return of the Thirteenth Cycle, a much older cosmic order begins to reassert itself. At this pivotal moment, Master Bat’s influence surges, and as the heavens realign with his domain, his growing power manifests through this event card.</p>

<p>Mechanically, this event disrupts many effects that would normally remove Bleeding Markers, including Heal. As a result, any model with the Bleed Trait becomes significantly more lethal, its damage lingering. Ideal for warbands that lean into damage-over-time mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the recent release of the Master Bat Ronin unit (who gives Bleed tokens on their attacks) and Nagato, who opened up the House Bleeding Moon Shadow Wind Clan theme, this Event means that those Bleed tokens are definitely going to be there in the end turn to do damage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-6.jpg?itok=_fyRFbIG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-6.jpg?itok=xQ5exTGY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Weeping Sky’s Influence</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The skies themselves are said to weep, mourning the faltering celestial order. As the heavens tremble, the consequences ripple through both the mortal realm and the spiritual plane, reshaping the balance of power across the Jwar Isles.</p>

<p>At the heart of this upheaval stands Lord Toad, master of the previous cycle and a divine force whose influence endures. Even King Sojobo, no stranger to ambition, offers him respect. Lord Toad is far from finished. He revels in the bounty his cycle has unleashed, and the signs of his lingering power are unmistakable.</p>

<p>From the quagmire and shadowed tunnels, the lifeless legions of the Imperial Court have begun to rise. Their emergence is no coincidence, it is a reaction to Lord Toad’s enduring will for change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This card offers a powerful early-game advantage: it prevents long-range attacks during Turn One, shielding your warband from opportunistic enemy volleys before formations are set. Whether you're protecting fragile units or setting up a bold advance, this effect can dramatically shift the tempo of the opening round.</p>

<p>The battlefield even becomes a quagmire, Lord Toad, ever the opportunist, thrives in this environment. The movement boost granted by the Quagmire effect plays perfectly into his slippery tactics, allowing him to reposition with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Toad was a recent Ronin release that can be used across all 14 factions. While in a quagmire, Lord Toad's movement is boosted by 2 to 6 and ignores all terrain and other models for the purposes of movement, rushing them ahead to make use of their Swallow Up ki feat to remove an enemy unit from the battlefield for a turn.</p>

<h2>Future&nbsp;Consequences</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Marvel Rivals has caused a major player spike on Steam, its highest in a while.</p>



<p>Released in December 2024, the free-to-play multiplayer superhero shooter has been going steady. With the release of Season 4, which added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela, the game has seen a decent, stable player base. While not as high as when its first season dropped, touting a 644,269 player count, it still ranks as one of the most popular games on Steam. In any case, earlier this week, the numbers rose quite a bit, heading into numbers only seen for the beginning of a season. Well, a new mode, one fans have been asking for for quite a while, has been added.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-pve-marvel-zombies-mode-almost-doubles-marvel-rivals-usual-player-count">New PvE Marvel Zombies Mode Almost Doubles Marvel Rivals’ Usual Player Count</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, earlier this week, Marvel Rivals kept at a usual 75k-80k player count, decreasing from the start of Season 4.5 with Daredevil. However, on October 23rd, the game spiked into the high 120k, almost double what it was the previous day. It continued into yesterday and today. The reason? The addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-pve-zombies-mode-arrives-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Zombies PvE mode</a> lets players fight against AI enemies. Based on the comic and new animated series, the limited-time Halloween-based mode brings it to life with droves of zombies and perilous fights with friends. </p>



<p>A quick look at Reddit supports the rise quite well, as many fans have praised the mode a ton. Some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1oeqvfe/holy_fucking_shit_is_the_marvel_zombies_game_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Living-Ad102</a>, want it to be a permanent addition to the game. Given that PvE has been asked for since the game’s release, the massive spike isn’t too surprising. If anything, it’s clear that NetEase may want to do more of these events. Either way, if you want in on the fun, best to do it before mid-November while Marvel Zombies lasts. </p>



<p>Have you played the Marvel Zombies mode in Marvel Rivals yet? If so, how is it? Would you like to see PvE added permanently to the base game? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

A thing I find a lot of joy in is the fact that despite there's technically a new, shinier, perhaps by some people's standards better version of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> is still kicking around. Before the Old School was tagged on the front end of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> was an MMO I put many hours into (and found little success in) as a youth with too much free time, so the fact practically two decades later it's introducing a brand new skill into the game simultaneously impresses me and strikes existential fear into my heart because of how old this game actually is.
</p>
<p>
Moving on swiftly, sailing! That's the new skill coming to Old School RuneScape, the first new one since its launch. According to a <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1">blog post</a>, sailing is quite the undertaking, described as "bigger and more expansive than any content that's come before it," and a skill that "touches almost every aspect of the game." With this new skill, you can own up to five boats at any time. These boats are upgradable, and there's three sizes to choose from: the raft, small boat, and large boat.

<p>
There's ship combat, which apparently mostly works the same as land combat, and you can also take a few different NPCs with you out on the sea - or your real friends too! Levelling up requires, technically, just one thing, which is, well, sailing. This includes "interacting with facilities on your boat" like trimming your sails, an action that nets you some XP as well as a speed boost.
</p><p>
On top of all that, you can salvage shipwrecks, chart the oceans you travel across, do some deep sea trawling, complete new quests, gather new resources, and while this one's a bit more secretive, there's new areas to explore too, including 30 new islands, some of which have some new dungeons.
</p>
<p>
The sailing update is coming to Old School RuneScape pretty soon too, as it's currently planned to launch in just under a month's time on November 19th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a sleepy Sunday, but it’s also time to wrap up your week with another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle will be easy for some, including <strong>boxing fans</strong>, but I’ve still provided the best hints around so that you can get things finished as fast as possible, then get on with the rest of your weekend.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-26">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #868:</p>



<ul>
<li>BEE</li>



<li>BUTTERFLY</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>STING</li>



<li>BRASS</li>



<li>PERCUSSION</li>



<li>STRING</li>



<li>WIND</li>



<li>BEAUTY</li>



<li>POPULARITY</li>



<li>STARING</li>



<li>TALENT</li>



<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>DROPLET</li>



<li>KITCHENETTE</li>



<li>STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think orchestra sections! These are categories of musical instruments</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe creatures or actions associated with light movement or flight</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These words relate to qualities often judged or admired in people or performances</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group plays with diminutives or cozy-sounding words</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 26.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-26-868">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 26 (#868)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRASS, PERCUSSION, STRING, WIND</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BEE, BUTTERFLY, FLOAT, STING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BEAUTY, POPULARITY, STARING, TALENT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DOGGY, DROPLET, KITCHENETTE, STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <p>FromSoftware has pushed back the release of the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> to "allow time for performance adjustments".</p>
<p>In a brief statement, the developer apologised for the delay, but said it was "wholeheartedly [working] toward release", which is now expected sometime in 2026. Sadly, a firmer release window has not been provided.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring's Switch 2 port, Tarnished Edition, was announced at a Nintendo Direct presentation back in April</a>. It's slated to include the base game and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature.</p> <div>

<p>FromSoft hadn't given a firm release date for the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition in 2025, but it was initially expected to release before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We apologise to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support," the team said.</p>
<p>As for FromSoftware's Elden Ring spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-unveils-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-mode-ahead-of-release-tomorrow">New mode Deep of Night mode is now live</a>, adding extra challenge to the multiplayer spin-off game. The world of Limveld will be full of deadlier enemies, and Nightlords won't be selectable, as in the main game, but instead players can traverse multiple depths, with escalating difficulty and challenges.</p>

            <p>Raven Software says its focus for the year ahead and Call of Duty: Warzone comes down to three pillars: "Battle Royale, Resurgence, and the future of the game".</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882">update</a> posted earlier today, the developer said the team was "incredibly excited and there is much more to come", including a "first look" at some of the updates on the way, but insisted "Battle Royale is the foundation upon which we've built every new mode, feature, and memorable moment".</p>

<p>"While we continue to innovate across the entire game, we feel it's important that Battle Royale remains a cornerstone of what we do," the developer stated. "That's why we're expanding Battle Royale to include support for multiple large maps via map rotation. While it wasn't previously realistic for us to host multiple large maps, we've since taken the steps necessary to support it. This won't be a launch feature with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, but it's a key addition slated for early next year."</p><p>Though it previously insisted it would "approach change more deliberately to preserve the original Warzone launch experience" after re-releasing Verdansk last spring, Raven confirmed it's going to "increase how often we release updates and refine the way we surface new features to you".</p> <div>

<p>"The goal is balance: keep things moving without forgetting about seasonal support and quality-of-life improvements," the team explained.</p>
<p>As part of that, Raven says it's heard you "loud and clear" about Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience, admitting it has "started to feel a bit stale".</p>
<p>"So, to start, we're delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow," Raven explained. "The launch of the new Haven's Hollow map in Season 01 will be another step in spicing up Resurgence. These past months, we've made changes based on feedback received during early previews of Haven's Hollow.</p><p>"Shortly after launch, we'll be bringing back map rotation to Resurgence, which will swap between Rebirth Island and Haven's Hollow," the statement added. "We are also exploring opportunities to bring back past maps in future seasons: an improved version of Fortune's Keep is underway as we speak. Our goal is to ensure that each map has room to shine without sidelining the ones that you love most."</p>
<p>Moving forward, the developer says it will continue to make "significant, meaningful improvements on multiple fronts", and intends to "deliver a higher frequency of updates, with a larger emphasis on balance changes no less than twice per season".</p>
<p>"Our approach to weapon and attachment balance is fundamentally shifting, which means redefined roles at launch followed by multiple balance passes per season with adjustments entirely unique to Warzone," Raven explained. "Regular updates will extend beyond weapons to include shifts in ground loot, perks, equipment, contracts, and much more throughout the year."</p>
<p>Players can expect a seasonal roadmap next month, and more Ranked Play camos in Season 2, as well as "the arrival of our new Blackout experience on Avalon during Season 2".</p>
