            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24200304/voicemod-key-xbox-playstation-voice-changer-soundboard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular voice changing software Voicemod is finally going to work with game consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. While Voicemod has been available as an app on Windows PCs for more than five years, platform limitations have forced Voicemod to create dedicated hardware to bring its popular voice changer and soundboard to game consoles.</p><p><a href="https://www.voicemod.net/vmkey/">Voicemod Key</a> is a tiny USB-C dongle that turns your regular gaming headset and mobile phone into a voice changer and soundboard for game consoles, phones, and tablets. “The original idea was from the community, we found it on YouTube,” explains Voicemod chief operating officer Jochen Doppelhammer in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Voicemod can’t build an app for Xbox or PlayStation, so Voicemod users had been using headsets within headsets to get the voice changer working with their phones and consoles. One person even put together a bunch of audio splitters that fed the output of a microphone into Voicemod and then back out into the microphone input on a console. “They put it together and I was like, I need to try that! That was the initial idea, and with the splitter you find problems and to solve them we needed electronic components,” says Doppelhammer.</p><p>Voicemod Key works by using two audio jacks and a USB-C port to route your gaming headset into the Voicemod app on mobile and back out into your console. You plug your wired headset into one port, a stereo cable into the other, and then connect up the other end of the stereo cable to your game console. The dongle then plugs into the USB-C or Lightning port on your phone, where you can launch voice changing features or the soundboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>How Voicemod Key connects to a console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>Voicemod’s AI voices and real-time voice changing features will all be available, alongside buttons to launch custom soundboard audio that your friends will hear in a party chat. Voicemod is also planning to get its Key hardware working with voice chat apps on a phone in the future. Voicemod will turn its Key dongle into a virtual device so it loops back the audio and any iOS or Android apps will then receive the modified voice changing audio as if it were the real microphone. It’s similar to how Voicemod works on macOS or Windows, with virtual audio devices.</p><p>Doppelhammer and the Voicemod team have had to create hardware to solve a software restriction in closed platforms like iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. You can publish apps on many of these platforms, but Apple, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo don’t let developers get deep access to the audio components.</p><p>I get the sense that Voicemod Key is a solution that Doppelhammer and the team are reluctantly having to build to try and prove to platform holders that they should open up and allow apps like Voicemod.</p><p>Voicemod Key will only work with wired headsets, largely because of the way it captures the audio and modifies it. Proprietary solutions like Xbox Wireless won’t be supported, and the latency of Bluetooth would make a real-time voice changer like Voicemod challenging. Doppelhammer says the “vast majority of our target audience” is more inclined to use a wired headset or have access to one, so he’s not too concerned about the lack of support for wireless headsets at launch.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Voicemod Key hardware will be bundled with subscriptions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>If Voicemod were able to build a native app on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, the wireless problem would be solved. “We don’t want to build our own device. This will enable a lot of conversations, because people will see how it works, what it takes, and that there’s a market,” says Doppelhammer. “This whole thing made me realize one thing: PC and Mac are the only platforms left that are half-way open. Everything else is locked down.”</p><p>Voicemod has grown in popularity in recent years as people look to real-time voice changing software and soundboards to be more expressive in online words like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Roblox</em>. Voicemod was once a niche app for Twitch streamers, but Voicemod Key aims to bring the software to people who play <em>Fortnite</em> on console or <em>Roblox </em>on a tablet or mobile phone.</p><p>The first version of Voicemod&nbsp;Key, with support for a console mode, will soon be available for <a href="https://www.voicemod.net/vmkey/">registered beta testers</a>. Voicemod is planning to bundle the hardware with its Voicemod Pro subscription, so you won’t need to purchase it separately. The team is targeting a launch later this year in the US, with a second version supporting both console and mobile early next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>1047 Games have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, sequel to the gambolling free-to-play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from 2021 in which you could blast people through wormholes. The new game brings back said wormhole-based carnage together with newly "faction-forward" teamplay, and if you want to know what "faction-forward" means when it's at home, I encourage you to stick your whole head into the below crackling cinematic trailer-vortex. I promise nothing bad will happen to it on the other side.</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 sports three factions, each favouring a particular style of quantum superpositional skull-splattery, in addition to new arenas, weapons and modes. We see a bit of that in the trailer: one character has a pop-up holo-shield, another has an electric frisbee, a third keeps things simple with a homing rocket launcher. It's apparently a big step up in production scale from the 2021 game, which the developers characterise as something they slapped together in their pyjamas at a sleepover, using detergent bottles and jam. Since then, 1047 Games have swelled to around 150 people, amongst them veterans of such venerated gunalots as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/halo">Halo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call Of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>"The original Splitgate's development was ambitious but scrappy; the game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams," 1047's co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx observes in a release. "This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry.</p>
<p>"This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters," he went on. "It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community." Thank you Mr Proulx, I have filled out my press release bingo card now, though you forgot to tell me how laser-focussed Splitgate 2 is on delivering immersion.</p>
<p>Hark at me and my jadedness! I'm just grumpy because I keep accidentally writing "Slipgate". You'd think I'd be more receptive to the sequel to a game Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-review">laser-tagged with a Bestest Best</a>, summarising it as a "raucous shooter that goes beyond its portal gimmick, with first-rate arenas and gutsy gunfights". For my part, I can only comment that the screens below remind me of Halo's louder map designs. I'll have to give the 2021 game a try.</p>

			<p>It's a pretty big GeForce NOW Thursday, as NVIDIA has confirmed that its cloud streaming service has been integrated into Xbox.com game pages, making it even faster and easier to launch supported PC games. As you might recall, a few Xbox users <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-streaming-seems-to-be-available-directly-on-xbox-game-pass-for-certain-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> GeForce NOW on game pages a couple of weeks ago, and it looks like the feature is now officially rolled out to everyone.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. NVIDIA is also discounting Premium Memberships for a limited time; both the Priority and the Ultimate tiers are half off until August 18, allowing GeForce NOW users to subscribe for a monthly $4.99 or $9.99, respectively. If you're a regular cloud user, you may want to pick the discounted six-month subscription, which would be $25 for the Priority tier and $50 for the Ultimate tier.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also a wave of nine games added to the library, seven of which have just launched or are launching today.</p>
<p>● The Crust (New release on Steam, July 15)<br>
● Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder (New release on Steam, July 16)<br>
● Nobody Wants to Die (New release on Steam, July 17)<br>
● Dungeons of Hinterberg (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, July 18)<br>
● Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, July<br>
18)<br>
● Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (New release on Steam, July 18)<br>
● Norland (New release on Steam, July 18)<br>
● Content Warning (Steam)<br>
● Crime Boss: Rockay City (Steam)</p>
<p>The highlights of this GeForce NOW round are Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, which we have recently reviewed favorably:</p>
<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>) is a breath of fresh air. Despite a slow start, a low challenge level, and an almost non-existent narrative, this action game-meets-tower defense experience is engaging and can be enjoyed by all sorts of players, even those who aren't typically into the genre. Hopefully, the game will turn into a series in the future, and a sequel will address the few shortcomings that hold Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess back a little.</em></p>
<p><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-accessible-and-fun-soulslite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>) is an enjoyable and highly accessible Soulslite. A44 created a great entry point for the genre, not to mention an exciting fantasy setting that mixes black powder, magic, and influences that go beyond the usual European medieval style. The combat is fun and won't cause you to break any controllers. The story is also worth following, although the game perhaps ends up too soon, leaving narrative and gameplay possibilities to be explored by a sequel.</em></p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sues-social-media-user-for-excessive-slanderous-and-insulting-comments-against-employee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Eurogamer</a>, Sega has issued a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/240717_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> via its Japanese site confirming that it reached a settlement against a social media user who harassed an employee.</p>



<p>Loosely translated, the press release explains the individual “made excessive slanderous and insulting comments” against one Sega employee for a long time. </p>



<p>Sega continues that “the subject will pay damages to our employee, delete the slanderous and insulting comments, and refrain from such actions in the future.” It is currently unclear just how extensive the payments are.</p>



<p>Following the settlement, Sega reinforces that “we will continue to take appropriate action based on our Customer Harassment Policy when we judge any behavior to be malicious.” Sega seems prepared to take further legal action when necessary against social media harassment.</p>



<p>Last March, workers at Sega of America became the first staff of a major gaming company to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-workers-become-first-major-gaming-company-to-ratify-union-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratify a union contract</a>. It spans a variety of offices, and it covers approximately 150 full-time and temporary employees.</p>



<p>However, that same week, Sega also revealed plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-layoffs-studios-hit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lay off hundreds of employees</a> across a wide range of studios. Jurgen Post of Sega said in an email that “we need to respond to the changing economic landscape.”</p>



<p>On the content side, gamers are looking forward to the new Crazy Taxi, which Sega recently revealed will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-new-crazy-taxi-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world multiplayer title</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24200542/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In a world terrorized by gods, <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em> sees you step into the vengeful boots of Nor Vanek — armed with a cutlass, a flintlock, and a tiny magic god. The steampunk, open world of Kian needs saving as the armies of the dead flood from a magical doorway. But despite some clever ideas, an intriguing cast with excellent performances, and varied environments, this third-person souls-“lite” action RPG can’t escape the trappings of a clearly limited budget and lack of polish — which is a shame because it could’ve been an excellent way into the genre.</p><p>Players are thrust into the shoes of Nor during a battle that looks like it’s straight from both World War I and every generic dark fantasy. There are soldiers in uniform, with muskets and flintlocks, firing at zombies pouring out from some strange gateway in the distance. There are trenches and barbed wire, helmets on infantry, and medals on generals, while magical beings tear apart Nor’s comrades.&nbsp;</p><p>While the game does an acceptable job of introducing you to its mechanics, it does absolutely nothing when it comes to the setting. Even now, I cannot tell you much about the world. I can’t even tell you what “gods’’ are, aside from the fact that you are tasked with killing them.</p><p>Kills earn Nor reputation points that linger like “souls” or <em>Bloodborne</em>’s Blood Echoes. However, unlike soulsborne games, you can immediately claim the reputation. If you do not claim the reputation, you bolster a multiplier, which exponentially increases how much reputation you then earn, through each subsequent kill. However, if you’re hit even once, you lose it all. It’s a brilliant risk-reward system, balancing the unfairness of losing everything against the safety of immediate usage. You can use reputation points on upgrades, to purchase items, and so on.</p><p>The combat is fast-paced, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5">the new <em>God of War</em> games</a>, allowing Nor to use a variety of melee weapons, her flintlock, or a sniper rifle on the fly. She also gains access to magic after she meets an adorable god called Enki. He is in the shape of a cute fox with a soothing voice and wants to assist Nor in her goal of defeating the other gods. Like <em>God of War</em>, you have a constant companion, with whom Nor exchanges charming dialogue, commenting on the world or situation. Their relationship grows from one of distrust to friendship and proved the golden thread for me throughout the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>With Enki as both the source of magic and a wielder himself, combat turns into a balletic foray into weapon usage, dodging, and spells. Unfortunately, unlike soulsbornes or <em>God of War</em>, the animations are stiff and do not feel responsive. Fluidity and timing are key in such games, and the lack of polish isn’t merely “nice to have” but essential, given the split-second decisions and sense of flow constitutive of these experiences. This is especially felt in boss or miniboss fights, or against larger enemies, where their stiff animation is readily apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is also cursed by repetition: similar enemies resulting in similar fights, with only the background changing. Dying and respawning alongside enemies is of course a key staple of soulsborne games, but enemy variety helped undermine sterility. Flintlock does not really have this.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>The lack of polish is most damning here. You can see it in the game’s dated graphics, even if the designs remain creative. Stiff animations are compounded by faces that lack expression. The environments — ranging from snowy mountains to rock lands, deep caves to magic arenas — are varied, but it’s hard to ignore the ugly textures, poorly drawn nature, and questionable lighting.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a pity because the game relies a lot on dialogue and interaction with NPCs. For example, Nor travels initially with her surrogate father Baz (with the iconic voice of Elias Toufexis). He’s a merchant and smith of sorts who assists Nor in her travels, having injured himself in an initial foolish raid that led to many soldiers’ deaths. But, due to the poor character details, it was often hard to tell his emotions and feelings. The voice acting did all the lifting.&nbsp;</p><p>The frustration also rests with how the game communicates information. Those of us who suffer through FromSoftware games are used to obfuscation. However, those games don’t rely on dialogue, as they do not even feature a voiced protagonist (unless you count your choice of screaming and ignoring Sekiro for now). But <em>Flintlock</em> drips in dialogue, yet provides no background, introduction, or setup that allowed me to understand who Nor is or what the fight is about.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of that can be conveyed through well-designed cutscenes, with silence and expression doing a lot of work as with Kratos and Atreus in the new <em>God of War</em>. But, because <em>Flintlock</em> does not have that level of polish, we are denied that. Cutscenes are generally spartan and devoid of frills, simply guiding you from one area to the next.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>I felt like I was playing the sequel to a game that had introduced me to this world and these characters. Like I’d opened up to a late chapter in a thick fantasy book, without a glossary.&nbsp; While it was wonderful uncovering the weird world of Kian, I still felt detached from it.&nbsp;</p><p>I did love that Nor and Enki’s journey to defeat the gods does tangibly change the world. Villages can be rescued from bandits and others, returned — in the blink of an eye, with zero cutscenes — to the people. This opens up merchants and quests. Nor can also recruit NPC who provide permanent bonuses and equipment on her quest.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Flintlock </em>makes for a comfortable introduction to the intimidating soulsborne genre and even creates its own unique spin with its risk-reward mechanic. However, I am hesitant to outright recommend it, given its lack of polish and repetitive play. Its varied environments and the central relationship between Nor and Enki deserve praise, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing for veterans of such action RPGs, let alone for newcomers. </p><p><small>Flintlock <em>launches July 18th on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?</p>

</div><div>



            <p>I've been fumbling for a grasp on Bokeh's skull-splitting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a> since I first heard the words "brought to you by Keiichiro Toyama, former designer of Silent Hill, Siren and Gravity Rush". Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.</p><!--more-->
<p>Never seen The Thing? A quick summary: it's a creature feature in which a bunch of scientists near the South Pole find that their base has been invaded by an alien monster that can assume the form of whatever it eats, prompting an immediate spiral into foam latex and KY jelly-flavoured chaos. Slitterhead takes the idea, shifts it a few thousand miles north, and swaps out Kurt Russel for a bodiless force, the Hyoki, with the ability to possess human beings and enhance their skills. </p>
<p>You play the Hyoki, and your job is to chase down the Slitterheads - nasty insects who are <em>also</em> able to possess and transform human bodies, but rather more messily. In <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/slitterhead-how-silent-hills-creator-is-building-2024s-craziest-horror-game/">a demo attended by the active and avid folk of VGC</a>, the player begins as a stray dog, recalling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku7qnh261CY">the opening scenes of The Thing</a>, with perhaps a touch of commentary on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/animal-human-disease-kill-epidemic-covid-b2440567.html">real-life zoonotic diseases</a>. Can you pet the dog? Possibly, but I strongly advise that you stay away from dogs in the context of anything remotely influenced by The Thing.</p>
<p>Each hapless host has different capabilities. Some are armed. VGC feels that Slitterhead's combat isn't anything to write home about, despite the ability to warp into a bystander's head for a cheeky backstab, but there are some amusingly grisly mechanics involving traversal and exploration. For example, you can portal through a fence gap to a body on the other side, or leap your current host off a roof so that you can bounce to another in the street below. Toyama says the developers have leaned into the idea of civilians as disposable fodder. "Originally, they were supposed to be powerful, but that proved to be not entertaining," he told the site. Please say that again, Toyama, with a drawn-out, sinister pause between "not" and "entertaining".</p>
<p>My thoughts gravitate immediately and predictably to stealth gameplay. I like the idea of posing as a shopkeeper, eyeing up the clientele for wriggling temples and other symptoms of infestation. Perhaps it'll be like Assassin's Creed's old PvP modes. That said, I'm not sure how amenable Slitterhead will be to such foetid, forensic sandboxing in practice. "One decision we made early in the game was that we originally wanted an open-world setting for the game, but it wasn't reasonable with the budget," Toyama told VGC. "That decision worked well, boxing in the missions and progressing through the storyline."</p>
<p>Here's hoping the neighbourhoods are nicely crowded, at least, because I have seen more Quit/Restart screens than you've had hot dinners, and as such, I'm going to burn through plenty of hosts in my time with Slitterhead, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bokehs-silent-hill-and-siren-esque-slitterhead-gets-release-date-and-new-in-game-trailer">out on November 8th</a>. Take a few cues from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/will-we-ever-get-to-play-one-city-block">Warren Spector's legendary single city block RPG pitch</a>, maybe?</p>

			<p>A Final Fantasy IV high-quality AI movie was recently shared online, and it's so good it could pass for an official adaptation.</p>
<p><em>(Light spoilers for Final Fantasy IV will be found ahead. Avoid reading if you haven't experienced the first few hours of the game.</em></p>
<p>The movie, which was created by the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AILab.-fv8qb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user</a> behind an earlier<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vi-ai-live-action/"> Final Fantasy VI AI movie</a>, covers the events from the beginning of the game up until Cecil becomes a Paladin, giving viewers a look at some pretty accurate recreations of Cecil, Rosa, Kain, Rydia, Kain, Edward, Tellah, Yang, Palom and Porom. While it is evident even at a glance that it is an AI-created movie, it's still impressive how accurately it depicts characters and events from the classic entry in the Square Enix series.</p>
<p><iframe title="【FF4】AIでオープニングからパラディンになるまで再現してみた  (Final Fantasy 4 AI generated movie)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwCJrh4KI64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike the sixth entry in the series, which was only remastered and ported a few times, Final Fantasy IV did get a full 3D remake, originally released on Nintendo DS before being ported to other gaming systems. The 3D remake introduces new gameplay mechanics, CGI cinematics, and voice-acted cutscenes that breathe new life into the classic.</p>
<p>Those looking for a more authentic experience can play the Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster. This remaster is available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch, alongside the remasters of the other 2D entries in the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Trump Shooter Posted Cryptic Message on Steam Before Assassination Attempt]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/trump-shooter-steam-message/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trump-shooter-posted-cryptic-message-on-steam-before-assassination-attempt.930588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/trump-shooter-steam-message/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On July 13, a would-be assassin took several shots at presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania. He only succeeded in wounding the former U.S. President but shot and killed an innocent bystander in the crowd before being eliminated by the Secret Service. In the days that have followed the assassination attempt, plenty of information has surfaced online regarding the shooter.</p>



<p>It was revealed by a UK-based news outlet that ahead of his attempt, the gunman wrote a cryptic message on Steam that directly foreshadowed his actions.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-watch-as-it-unfolds">‘Watch as it Unfolds’</h2>



<p>Thomas Crooks travelled to the Trump rally in Pennsylvania with the intention of assassination the controversial presidential candidate. He managed to climb up to a nearby rooftop and lay prone as he lined up his target, opening fire but missing as Trump moved his head at the last second.</p>



<p>As internet users probed into the identity of the shooter, they uncovered a Steam profile that was verified as being owned by Crooks. It has since seemingly disappeared from the platform, but not before news outlets <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13645939/Trump-shooter-Thomas-Crooks-wrote-July-13-premiere-watch-unfolds-gaming-platform-Steam-shooting-former-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obtained a single comment</a> posted by Crooks before the shooting took place:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lo and behold, on July 13, Crooks attempted to make history by assassinating a former U.S. President (and potential future president). </p>



<p>This connection is sure to prove inflammatory, as many sitting in the United States government have been outspoken against the impact violent video games have on young people worldwide. Donald Trump has directly condemned ‘gory’ video games and has suggested that exposure to such games creates violent people who want to go on shooting sprees.</p>



<p>It’s an age-old debate that has been running rampant since the 1990s when violent games – especially shooters – started emerging. It was arguably kicked off in earnest by the Columbine shooters, who in 1999 killed 13 people in their high school in Littleton, Colorado. The pair’s connection to games like DOOM became widely publicised, and from then on, gory games were linked to several more prolific shootings, such as the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre and the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see what’s said about this in the coming days.</p>

    <div>
        

        <p>And here's how much they're paid.</p>

    </div>

            <p>
Court documents have revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - still - a team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">dedicated to game development</a>. 
</p>
<p>
How many people work on the world's most-used PC game store and launcher? As of 2021, just 79. Valve's hardware team stood at just 41 people as of the same year, a fraction of its games team which employed 181 people. A further 35 staff were described as being employed in "admin" roles. 
</p>
<p>
Altogether, that's just 371 people employed by Valve in 2021, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.

<p>
So, how much did Valve pay its team of 371 people, back in 2021? We know the figures divided up for each team, too. As laid out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">The Verge</a>, Valve's 79 staff working on Steam were paid a combined $76,446,633 - so, an average of $967k each. Its hardware team was paid a combined $17.7m - an average of $431k each. 
</p>
<p>
Valve's games team was paid a total of $192m for an average of $1m each. Even better off were its admin staff, who were paid a total of $157m, for an average of $4.5m each. Is this the team that Gabe Newell is in?
</p>
<p>
How do we know all this? Well, Valve is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gabe-newell-has-been-ordered-to-testify-in-person-at-a-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit">currently being sued by Humble Bundle's initial creator Wolfire Games</a> over the company's 30 percent cut taken from store purchases. (It's a similar fight to the one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">Epic Games is having with Apple and Google</a>, albeit over PC rather than mobile.) 
</p>
<p>
Wolfire has argued Steam has an effective monopoly over the PC market, and should end its power to block Steam games being sold for cheaper on rival storefronts - something it says has impacted its ability to do business via Humble. (Full disclosure - Humble is now owned by IGN Entertainment, which also owns this website.)
</p>
<p>
Back to Valve, and while the numbers above are just averages, and also three years out of date, it's worth noting that Valve's own public employee handbook claims the company offers "profitability per employee... higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft". Valve is yet to comment on the document, which was removed from court records after its contents were first reported.

            <p>
Tickets are now on sale for The Genshin Concert Tour, coming to the UK for one night only at Wembley Arena.
</p>
<p>
The concert will see music from Genshin Impact performed by the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg (conducted by Gast Waltzing), alongside visuals from the game.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the Wembley show on 29th October, the tour will also arrive in Berlin and Paris in December. Tickets are available to <a href="https://www.genshinconcert.live/">purchase online</a>.

Genshin Impact has certainly become a phenomenon since its release in September 2020. Its original music is produced in-house by HOYO-MiX at developer Mihoyo.
</p>
<p>
Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg is a German orchestra known for its performances of film music and concert works since its founding in 1918.
</p>
<p>
Game music concerts are thriving at the moment. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-concert-tour-visits-london-in-april">The Stardew Valley Festival of Seasons tour</a> has been ongoing this year, which added new dates due to its popularity.

</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Bertie attended an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-baldurs-gate-3-victory-tour-has-been-extraordinary-but-feels-like-its-finally-coming-to-an-end">orchestral performance of Baldur's Gate 3 as part of the Game Music Festival</a>, which acted as a victory tour following its numerous award wins.

</p>
<p>
I also attended the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-symphonic-adventure-was-the-perfect-recap-before-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring Symphonic Adventure</a>, which was the perfect recap ahead of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC.


</p>
<p>Still, Genshin Impact players and voice actors have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-voice-actors-speak-out-over-lack-of-diversity-in-genshin-impact-natlan-character-designs">criticised the lack of diversity in the character designs</a> from the game's new region.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-fc-25-will-feature-a-paid-season-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-sports-fc-25-paid-season-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a> reveals that EA Sports FC 25 will incorporate a paid season pass, which will net players rewards in three popular game modes: Ultimate Team, Career Mode, and Clubs. The ‘Premium Tier Pass’ will be an additional tier system for the existing free tier system.</p>



<p>The producer of EA Sports FC 25’s Ultimate Team mode, Karthik Venkateshan, revealed that the free tier in the new game will work similarly to what we saw in EA FC 24. “The premium pass will be something we’re adding on top,” added Venkanteshan. This season pass will be shared across their Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Career modes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Richard Waltz, the game design director for the Ultimate team on EA FC 25, shared that players will only notice something extra in the premium tier compared to the free tier at a high rank. The premium season pass will have “no exclusive rewards that will mean that you have to do that. We’re going to be having players, packs, that sort of thing, in Clubs, customisation options”, Waltz explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players will have the option to purchase the EA FC 25 Season Pass using coins or FC points. However, the price of this Premium Tier pass is not known at the moment.</p>



<p>At the same time, EA FC 25 is a paid flagship title that already includes microtransactions, and introducing a paid season pass might raise some concerns among the players. For instance, the Apex Legends community isn’t too happy about the new battle pass system, and they are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressing their disappointment on Steam right now</a>.</p>

Also, the upcoming game will include a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/womens-career-mode-comes-to-ea-sports-fc-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Women’s Career Mode</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-mode-everyone-buy/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-mode-everyone-buy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has just released a new Escape from Tarkov update, and this one gives anyone the ability to purchase the new PvE mode that was introduced several weeks ago. Until now, only Edge of Darkness and Unheard Edition players could access PvE (Player vs. Environment), but this latest offer now means that anyone can get involved – <strong>for a price</strong>.</p>



<p>It costs $20 to secure PvE forever – once you’ve bought it, you own it until you decide to delete your Escape from Tarkov account, or something.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-pve-is-now-platform-wide">Tarkov’s PvE Is Now Platform-Wide</h2>



<p>Everyone can now play on Tarkov’s PvE mode, which has proven to be something of a solid alternative to the traditional PvP experience. For those who aren’t too emboldened by the idea of playing against savvy, skilled players who are unpredictable, talented, and at times overpowered, PvE represents the perfect mode to soak up everything the game offers.</p>



<p>In PvE, you’ll get the full experience – quests, trading, PMCs (AI), bosses, and the crushing disappointment of having a great raid only to be one-tapped by a Scav at 100m through a bush.</p>



<p>It’s a comprehensive offering that has some key advantages. Firstly, you can play PvE with other players, which means you’re not losing that team element. Second, it isn’t subject to regular wipes, so you’re not bound by time to complete as many quests as possible before your account is reset. But with that being said, you can still initiate a wipe yourself, if you want that experience. </p>



<p>Also, running an ‘offline’ PvE raid – which means playing solo (not as a Scav or on Streets of Tarkov) will load you into your raid in a matter of seconds, and not minutes. It’s a like-for-like replica of Tarkov, you’re just losing the element of fighting other players – that’s it. </p>



<p>Now that Battlestate Games has released this update, anyone can sample PvE – it just costs $20 to get that opportunity locked down.</p>

            <p>When you dive into the mess of folders on your PC, what do you find? Cobweb-plastered manuscripts for those twelve fantasy novels you started? Mouldy design documents for those nine games you never actually began coding? Perhaps dozens of little motheaten thumbnails of that masterpiece you're planning to someday paint? Relax, I'm not calling you out (I have my own groaning cybercabinet of neglect). Rather, I'm here to say don't worry. Everyone does it. Even famous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> character designer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> director Tetsuya Nomura, who has a “huge number of game proposals lying dormant” in a mish mash of folders on his PC. You're just like him!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nomura made the comments in an interview with Famitsu (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-tetsuya-nomura-has-a-huge-stock-of-game-proposals-lying-dormant/">translated by Automaton</a> - thanks!) where he spoke alongside Takumi Isobe, director of upcoming action RPG Reynatis. When asked about the number of projects he has, Nomura jokes that his computer is a "labyrinth" replete with scenarios and synopses. He's unsure if any of them "will ever see the light of day". A bunch of game ideas and proposals get plopped into a folder simply called "NEW".</p>
<p>The veteran Square Enix man talks some more about his creative habits in the interview. I'll let you delve deeper if you want. I just wanted to evoke some sense of common humanity to all those frantic souls with fifteen first drafts languishing in the dark corners of their desktop. Because reader, I am also he. In many ways, I too am the man who designed the characters of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>. I too have been credited on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/33342/tetsuya-nomura/">103 video games</a>. We are the same. </p>
<p>I'm being silly. But I really do like it when the people we look upon so often as the legends of an industry reveal something mundane and ordinary about their working life, like the state of their folder hierarchy. All those people you admire, they do not only pee and poop, but they close the wrong tab by accident too. They get lost in their own sub-directories and have to quickly scribble down any idea that comes to mind into hasty documents so they don't "forget what the proposal is about", in Nomura's own words. If you spend a lot of time working on a PC, there is something genuinely unifying and levelling about the idea that even those we call the greats must click "remind me later" multiple times a day. Even Shigeru Miyamoto has probably typed his password with caps lock on and only realised it after hitting enter.</p>

            <p>
To celebrate today's launch of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Capcom has released a video performance of a traditional Japanese theatre show detailing its story.
</p>
<p>
It's performed by the National Bunraku Theatre, an Osaka-based company celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. Bunraku theatre combines narrative recitation, puppetry, and music, dating back to the Edo period from 1603 to 1868.
</p>
<p>
The performance is a tribute to the new game, which is steeped in Japanese folklore.

The game itself combines fast-paced action with tower defence gameplay and is out today across PlayStation 4, PS5, PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-demo-available-now-okami-collaboration-announced">demo from earlier this month is still available</a> to give the game a try. 

</p>
<p>
The game was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-reveals-path-of-the-goddess-at-xbox-games-showcase">revealed at the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>, with a proper look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-reveals-first-gameplay-at-xbox-partner-direct">gameplay provided at the Xbox Partner Direct</a> earlier this year.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure.930543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let me preface this review by stating that it was a weird experience. It’s been a while since I’ve been a spectator of so many peaks, valleys, troughs to trawl through, and clarity to connect the dots. If anything, I’ve left the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg"><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em></a> a changed individual, and whether that’s a good thing? Well, I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p>This is the debut title from Austrian-based developers Microbird, who’ve made <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> as a love letter to their country of origin. You play as Luisa, a trainee for a law firm who is taking a hard-earned break to Hinterberg, based in the Austrian Alps. Not only is she using it as a chance to decompress, but to also master the new-found dungeons and magic that have cropped up in the area.</p>
<p>The game runs on a day-by-day basis. In the morning, you’ll get up, figure out where to go, and then decide whether it’s a day of dungeoneering, slaying beasts and looting up, or relaxing and taking in the sights. Both options have their benefits – the former more so than the latter – but once the evening clocks in, it’s time for a bit of shopping, socializing, and sleeping.</p>

<p>I will say that my first impressions weren’t great. When combat is introduced, you’ll quickly find how shallow it becomes, even in the later stages. You’re relegated to a light attack/heavy attack button layout, with a dodge roll and a rather meager stamina system added for good measure. There isn’t a combo system attached, so you’re largely just smacking your chosen attack until everything drops.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> does try to make combat a bit more exciting and involving, in the form of “conduits”; massively powerful attacks that tend to devastate groups of enemies too easily. The game does know this and tries to limit how frequently you can use these conduits, but some might say not nearly enough, as energy for it drops all the time in battle.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the enemy variety is there, but visual design is not. All of the enemy designs are a murky brown with silver streaks running through them, and it makes readability a nightmare since a lot of enemy strategy boils down to clumping up together. Thankfully, there are the occasional bosses that break up the monotonous flow with some genuinely good combat design that makes the best out of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s gimmicks.</p>

<p>Of the 4 hub areas you’ll be looking for dungeons in, each one has a “skill shrine”. These offer you two magic spells exclusive to the area – one special attack, and a ranged attack – which not only can be used in combat but also in environmental puzzles <em>Hinterberg </em>offers inside and outside of the titular dungeons. This is where the game shows its hand a bit further.</p>
<p>They’re not complete brainbusters, but they’re a welcome break from just how dull <em>Hinterberg</em>’s combat can be, even in numbers. What does suck is that when I say the magic spells are exclusive to their specific hub areas, I mean it. The magical floating snowboard can only be used on the wintery peaks of Kolmstein, as the rest of the world cannot account for its special abilities.</p>
<p>Regardless, it makes for a better break than the rest of what the game has to offer, as the structure is largely obfuscated by its ludicrously fast pacing. The closest comparison one could make is with the eerily similar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/boyfriend-dungeon-review"><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em></a>, where the holiday appears to be on a time limit. <em>Hinterberg </em>offers several places where it treats the world as an actual spectacle, rightfully so but with rewards that are pitiful in comparison to what you can simply find and buy elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of NPCs who are just downright unlikable. If you run into anybody who isn’t a local, they’re written with such a smug air of cynicism, that even the promise of a helpful character upgrade isn’t enough to spend a night with them. If you want to use the game's photo mode, you’ll have to spend a minimum of one night with a depressing and arrogant journalist who refuses to engage in even the smallest amount of whimsy, and that's before things turn sour.</p>
<p>Spend time with the locals however, and you’ll see <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> switch from a middling dungeon crawler to an interesting and arresting commentary on privilege. I’m not even kidding, when you hear from the locals, the perspective changes, and suddenly it’s no longer a cutesy dungeon crawler with a charming cel-shaded aesthetic, but <em><span><span>Pokémon </span></span></em>by way of Alan Moore.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the energy is alive as you begin to realize just how much Microbird cares – not just about the game world they’ve created, but the world they inhabit outside of it. The amount of disdain it appears to host for “instagrammable” ideals, tourist traps, and theme parks built into decades of culture. Now I was playing to stop it, for the sake of a world that uses the town of Hinterberg as a perpetual name tag.</p>

<p>And then… I’m not going to say it drops the ball, but <em>Hinterberg</em>’s combat fails to make up for the spectacle the world starts to present. The final handful of bosses struggle with camera placement, legitimate strategy, and a narrative that doesn’t really know where to go from the conclusion it sets up. Without going into heavy spoilers, imagine if the goal of brushing your teeth was just cleaning the front set.</p>
<p>Sure, no one else can see the back row, but they're going to be thinking about it.</p>
<p>Still, there was an urge to return to the <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, even if it was for a short while. The game has a fantastic trick that nearly every player is going to gloss over on their first playthrough, so I was raring to go. However, trying to get through the combat a second time just wasn’t cutting it for me.</p>
<h2><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>I love the world of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I love the people that inhabit it, and the soft characterizations Microbird applies to each and every one of them. It's just that the core combat can be so tedious, that it became an obstacle I had to contend with to get to the good stuff. Sure, I could use Hinterberg as a retreat, but I care about this world, and as the game goes on, it’s quite clear that a lack of action doesn't help anybody.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
A flowery, gorgeous world that is enthralling to listen to, but abrasive to interact with, to the point where its structure can confuse players with its intent. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

Here is an incomplete list of people, creatures or things that susceptible Terrans have glimpsed in the surface of the Moon: an old man, a rabbit, a crow, a moose, a toad, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjqb44/moroccos-anti-colonial-moon-king-livesinside-this-artists-memory">King Mohamed V of Morocco</a>.

<p>
Going by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073490/To_the_Stars/">Steam demo</a>, To The Stars could be one of those deceptively simple timesinks. Each round starts you off with a single planet, with a number denoting the size of its starfleet. Click and drag a starlane to a neighbouring planet within range, and your scowling, smiling homeworld will proceed to sweat spaceships in that direction, chewing away at the target's garrison till it takes possession. 
</p>
<p>
In the process, it will also swiftly and merrily consume its own mass, devouring its internal resources till at last it explodes, by which point you'll hopefully have conquered that neighbouring planet, and be making inroads on two others. Yes, this is a "planet-hopping" game in the sense of hopping over crumbling platforms in Sonic. The empire must grow, because it is forever munching away at its own foundations. Of possible relevance: this game has funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.
</p>
<p>
Should two planets send ships to attack each other, the one with the higher garrison capacity will usually prevail, but you can sway the odds by having other planets reinforce the defending planet. Again, it might seem simple. But then a few of your reinforcing worlds go pop, and then a third faction mounts an assault on your homeworld, and the whole board swirls around into an unexpected configuration.
</p>
<p>
Swallowing all the planets and exterminating all the other races is one way to win. Another is colonising all of the local astral monuments. These lack ship construction facilities, however, making them a chore to Klingon to, but if the other civs in play have higher overall ship speed and power stats, it might be your only option.
</p>
<p>
Each race - they include a faction of villainous cats and a society of crystalline yoga instructors - has a couple of special abilities on a cooldown, such as laser defences or a mind control aura that flips the allegiance of approaching vessels. There are some fun, unannounced variables - for instance, exploding planets wipe out ships within the blast radius, potentially buying a civ on the ropes a short reprieve. Speaking of reprieves, you can pause the game at any point. You'll probably want to, because the fact that every planet is a ticking timebomb means that most rounds are over in moments.
</p>
<p>
I really like the little I've played of To The Stars, which hits <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073490/To_the_Stars/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/to-the-stars-80b18e">Epic Games Store</a> in August. It's an adult kid's game, if that makes sense, an Aardman take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> with a sickly undertow of Ren &amp; Stimpy. The soundtrack is great, too - it's as twitchy and sherberty and insidious as the visuals. The trouble is, planetary phantasmagoria of this sort can be contagious. When I next look at the moon, will I see one of this game's celestial ogres leering back at me?

            <p>
While the world waits for news on Switch 2, there's still life in Nintendo's current aging console yet - and money to be made - as evidenced by the reveal of a Joy-Con Charging Stand.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo made the announcement via social media this morning, with word the device was officially dubbed the Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory, and would be available to buy from 17th October. 
</p>
<p>
How much will it cost? For now, Nintendo is keeping that rather crucial detail to itself.

<p>Why now? Well, people are more likely to have additional Joy-Con rattling around now than they did back at the Switch's launch in 2017, and it's a bit of a faff to ensure they all remain charged. </p>
<p>
Also, well, it's the Switch 1's final Christmas - why not make a bit more money off the old girl while you still can?

<p>
Will original Switch Joy-Con work on Switch 2? Nintendo hasn't said, though this would probably make the charging stand more of an investment. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">it will lift the lid on Switch 2 properly before the end of its current financial year</a>, however - so before 1st April 2025. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Nintendo has rustled up an array of games to see off the Switch 1 this Christmas. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> releases on 26th September, Super Mario Party Jamboree launches on 17th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">Mario and Luigi Brothership</a> arrives 7th November, while Donkey Kong Country Returns HD slips in on 16th January 2025. Later in 2025 - and almost certainly also on Switch 2 - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.

Each vessel contains mana from a different element. You can wield these powers in combat and while exploring.</p><p><strong>Exploration: Elemental Triggers</strong></p><p>You can use an elemental vessel at the curiously glowing triggers scattered throughout the land and harness its individual power to generate gusts of wind, move rocks, or even slow down time to open pathways and find hidden items on the map. Once you get a new vessel, don’t forget to revisit areas you’ve already passed through. Accessing other triggers will unlock new places for you to explore.</p><p><strong>Battles: Switching Classes</strong></p><p>Obtain the various elemental vessels to switch your characters to new classes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony's rumored upgraded PlayStation 5 model, the PS5 Pro, might very well not release later this year.</p>
<p>At least, that's what reputable leakier Tom Henderson appears to have been suggesting on X some hours ago. When asked about a possible September announcement for the long-rumored Pro model, Henderson <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1813546361872347328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> - "If it releases this year!". While this doesn't directly confirm that the PS5 Pro model won't be launching this year (heck, Sony hasn't even commented on the model's existence), this reply is somewhat interesting as Henderson has long been saying that Sony is planning a holiday 2024 release for the Pro model.</p>
<p>Back in March of 2023, Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-is-in-the-works-for-a-late-2024-release-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Sony was working on a PS5 hardware revision with a release sometime in late 2024. Several months later, in July 2023, Henderson talked about the codename for the PS5 Pro model - Trinity - <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-rumored-to-launch-in-november-2024-with-accelerated-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a planned release date in November 202</a>4. "Whether or not a PlayStation 5 Pro console is desired enough in the current market remains to be seen, but as of writing, the PlayStation 5 Pro is in development and is targeting a November 2024 release date", Henderson wrote back then (via Keytogaming).</p>
<p>Some months ago, Henderson again talked about the Pro model, <a href="https://wccftech.com/latest-ps5-pro-specs-are-real-says-insider-sony-still-targeting-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying the then leaked specs of the console were the real deal</a>. In addition, he said that Sony still appeared to be targeting a Holiday 2024 launch for the beefed-up PS5 console. Whether internal plans at Sony have changed or not remains to be seen at this point. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the rumored PS5 Pro model. For now, check out the leaked specs of the console below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger GPU with faster memory, providing 45% improved performance in rasterized rendering;</li>
<li>Massively improved ray tracing architecture that should deliver 2-3x speedup over the regular PS5, with peaks of 4x;</li>
<li>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second) at 8-bit;</li>
<li>The ML architecture was built to enable the so-called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique. The leaked document describes it as Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm. According to the leaked info, PSSR currently supports up to 4K, but there are plans to add 8K support;</li>
<li>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires similar inputs to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. Moreover, no per-game training is required, just like with the latest version of DLSS. The document goes on to say PSSR requires just 250MB of the PS5 Pro's memory, with a current rendering cost of 2 milliseconds to upscale from Full HD to 4K, although optimization is still ongoing;</li>
<li>The document also includes an image comparison with TAAU and AMD FSR 2, reportedly showing that PSSR offers superior image quality.</li>
</ul>

			<p>Harebrained Schemes has started teasing their new game called Graft. The brief video appears to show a sci-fi setting, which may or may not be based in the Shadowrun universe. Gamers interested in following the development of Graft can register for the newsletter <a href="https://www.harebrained-schemes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. Don't expect to play the game this year or the next, though: the LinkedIn profile of Executive Producer Mike McCain (who returned to Harebrained Schemes earlier this year after directing BATTLETECH and Shadowrun: Dragonfall) mentions an unannounced game launching in 2026.</p>
<p>Then again, it's an appropriate timeline if you know what the studio has been up to. HBS launched the turn-based tactics game The Lamplighters League last October. Unfortunately, the game's reception and sales performance were so weak that parent company Paradox Interactive quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/harebrained-schemes-splits-with-paradox-will-seek-new-funding-and-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parted ways with the developer</a>, causing Harebrained Schemes to lay off many developers. The studio was also forced to go indie and seek funding elsewhere for its new project, which we now know to be called Graft.</p>
<p>As for what it actually is, we know very little about it from the HBS blog. In January, they wrote:</p>
<p><em>It is audacious. It builds on the best of the studio’s history while still being something new and compelling in the strategy space. It’s narratively rich, and there are so many natural connections between the narrative themes and the gameplay systems.</em></p>
<p>The developers made a demo and showed it to publishers at GDC 2024, where it reportedly got a lot of attention, according to Mike McCain:</p>
<p><em>This indie band has been firing on all cylinders! Iterating daily, and making smart and pragmatic decisions with some big creative wind in our sails. We landed in San Francisco with a stronger prototype and vision for our next game than we could have imagined at the start of the year. We met with a whole bunch of potential partners at GDC, and got some fantastic reactions to both the world we’re crafting and the prototype we’ve built. A couple ideas in particular really got eyes lighting up and folks nodding along with enthusiasm. Now, we keep talking and see where that energy leads.</em></p>
<p>Following this teaser, we might learn some actual details about Graft in the near future. Until then, stay tuned.</p>
