            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Would you say that Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive's&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is indicative of the quality of the Scottish gaming industry as a whole? If you would, then you'd seemingly be in agreement with none other than UKIE trade body head Nick Poole.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/npoole_edinburgh-dice-supercharge-activity-7373061435859410945-xtn9/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;(as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/chief-exec-of-uk-videogames-industry-body-boasts-about-strength-of-scottish-games-industry-using-build-a-rocket-boy-mindseye.1297998/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RedbullCola</a>) ahead of a visit to Scottish capital Edinburgh, Poole said the next couple of years will be "really exciting for Scotland's video game and interactive entertainment industry".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that Scotland has a "really dynamic grassroots ecosystem", as well as "some major emerging players and leading work-for-hire studios and service providers". This all seems fairly innocent so far, but at the bottom of the post, Poole includes a (very low-res) shot of concept art for&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-scottish-gaming-industry-ukie-shooting.jpg?itok=cpiLm9u3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-scottish-gaming-industry-ukie-shooting.jpg?itok=MItMRGal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>apparently represents the Scottish gaming industry well enough for UKIE head Nick Poole.</figcaption></figure><p>While Poole doesn't specifically say that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is an exemplar of the Scottish industry, the inclusion of the picture does seem to suggest that he thinks it's a good example of what the country can produce in terms of gaming.</p>

<p>One rather suspects that this either means Poole has terrible gaming taste or that he hasn't actually played&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, and if the latter is true, he also doesn't appear to have paid attention to any of the discussion surrounding the game.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">a disastrous reception</a>, which appears to have led to developer Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laying off more than 100 employees</a> in the game's wake.</p>

<p>The launch went so badly that it even seems to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">rethink its relationship to third-party publishing</a>, which is a pretty impressive feat, although probably not in the way Build a Rocket Boy would like.</p>




<p>What's particularly galling about Poole's comments is that Rockstar North, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, is based in Edinburgh, and it would have been incredibly easy to point to that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-reveals-best-selling-playstation-games-of-all-time" rel="nofollow">insane level of success</a> as an example of the power of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

<p>One rather hopes that someone points out to Poole, who heads up one of the <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UK's most important and influential gaming bodies</a>, that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>isn't the best example to lead with when praising Scotland, but only time will tell.</p>

              <p>Often considered to be the rarest <em>Pokémon</em> card of all, the so-called Pikachu Illustrator (it’s proper name is “Pokémon Illustrator” but no one calls it that) was a print of around 41 cards given to winners of a Japanese competition in 1998. It has since gone on to become notorious, not just for being so highly valued and sought after, but for being the card <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">on which one Logan Paul spent $5,300,000 in 2022</a>. Another of the cards, this one graded as a PSA 9, has just <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416">sold for a flat $4,000,000 on eBay</a>, reaffirming it as the most valuable <em>Pokémon</em> card of all.</p> <p>In 1998, when the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was in its infancy, the prize of a unique Pikachu card for the CoroCoro Comic Illustration Contest must have been nice enough, but not all&nbsp;<em>that</em> special. It’s not known exactly how many were handed out, but it’s believed 41 were printed, made unique by having the word “ILLUSTRATOR” where “TRAINER” would usually appear. The holographic image shows Pikachu clutching an enormous paintbrush, while the Japanese text underneath congratulates the recipients as having been “recognized as excellent in the Pokémon Card Game Illustration Contest.” It’s not known how many survive, but of those that do, the condition they’re in becomes everything. The card Logan Paul bought for $5,275,000 was graded as a PSA 10, meaning it is in absolutely perfect condition. Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">a PSA 7 version in 2023 put up for bids starting at $480,000</a> received not a single offer and went unsold.</p> <p>On Friday September 12, however, another colossal sale price got added to the roster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-sells-for-4-million-on-ebay-3250904/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>.) A PSA 9 version of the Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416?_skw=pikachu+illustrator+psa+9&amp;itmmeta=01K52B559AYKACEQJRAQ7FYPBQ&amp;hash=item548061bf10:g:ZMkAAOSw2gBftsUY&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cD8%2B4RNIGPjfQu10cI3i7MiADIleeZmkMYbcHoGskKVW1uFRrdDQysRGobsccSxuxXNvblhU%2FDuNa8rtRuryQ4jRrEqmuDdthKCzWAkeGrOHT15w6WQt0QPM0uUbamjZPwSrbdviamyB6ZO3%2BEbbja5BqX80KH0oj4pd%2Fx8deTTy%2BeUD96JJSDtNmqyAEbZLX4p68cWqQwaFo98rDfp%2BlTV7vJOAIRPgSvcbxGaGuWwPR9WHUFXjtiqjIPLTu%2FxucxvKlojILs3rcAnLeH4Jb1%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_jUlMuoZg">went up for auction on eBay from seller Scott “smpratte” Pratte, and sold for a cool $4,000,000</a>. This specific card, described as “the Holy Grail of Pokémon,” was for a long time thought to be the only PSA 9 to exist, submitted by Pratte himself after he added it to his collection in 2011. <a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/9249/collector-profile-scott-pratte-profiling-premier-pokemon-trading-card-prognosticator">According to PSA</a>, in 2017 there were four examples graded 9, and at some point Pratte had owned all four of them. In 2013 he sold another PSA 9 version of the Pikachu, listing it for $100,000, but eventually accepting an offer for $50,000. That’s 1.25 percent of what he got for another Pikachu Illustrator with the game grading this weekend. <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-trainer-promo-hologram-trading-card-1998-psa-9-mint/a/7141-91305.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">He sold another in 2016 for just $55,000</a>, which at the time was considered to be&nbsp;<em>extraordinarily</em> high.</p>

 <p><em>Pokémon </em>card prices started to grow in 2020, as the covid lockdowns seemed to drive people to their lofts to find old binders, with classic cards becoming incredibly desirable. This peaked in 2022 when Logan Paul bought the PSA 10 Illustrator as a stunt, and then wore it around his neck on a chain during one of his fake-ass boxing fights. That remains the most expensive card ever, but this weekend’s sale suggests the impact of that price is lasting. Not least considering a PSA 9 Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7287-36167.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">sold the same year for $840,000</a>.</p> <p>It’s not clear why Pratte has chosen to part with it now, although I can think of four million really good reasons. It’s really hard to imagine this value sustaining, so there’s a decent chance it’s been sold at its peak. It’s notable that <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-mint-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7442-36073.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515">someone else sold an identical card just last month for only $625,000</a>, the only difference being that Pratte’s was the first to be graded at 9. You’d imagine whoever sold it must be <em>furious&nbsp;</em>right now, but I can’t help but notice the listing uses the same “Holy Grail!” language as Pratte’s eBay listing. Look, eventually <em>someone’s</em> going to notice that it’s a piece of cardboard. Also, PSA now lists 15 of the card graded PSA 9, 12 as PSA 8, and 7 as PSA 7.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-voyagers-review.1298160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a preview session where I was able to play the first half an hour of LEGO Voyagers, the mandatory-two-player, what-if-Hazelight-made-a-LEGO-game adventure from developer Light Brick Studios and arthouse publisher Annapurna Interactive, I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-voyagers-might-already-be-my-favorite-lego-game-ever">wrote</a>, “LEGO Voyagers might already be my favorite LEGO game ever.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keyword: <em>might</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One less-than-ideal thing happened between my initial preview and my 14-year-old daughter and I completing the full version of LEGO Voyagers – where we tumbled, built, and played our way through to the end credits in same-screen co-op: it ended all too quickly. Though we enjoyed it the whole way through – it left us disappointingly unfulfilled because it ended just as it seemed like it should be hitting its stride. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Short But Sweet</h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Voyagers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, we rolled credits after just three and a half hours – even less than the slim five hours the publisher told us to expect. I’ve never been one to knock a game just for being short. Heck, Playdead’s Inside is still probably the greatest game I’ve ever personally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review">reviewed</a> at IGN, and it, like LEGO Voyagers, is a dialogue-free adventure that ended in less than four hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Inside left my jaw on the floor in astonishment at the incredible masterpiece I’d just experienced, LEGO Voyagers left both my and my daughter’s jaws on the floor for an entirely different reason: We both said, “Wait, that’s it?” To be fair, this is a $25 game and not everything has to be a Silksong. But it did leave both of us wanting more in a, “No really, we actually thought there’d be more than this,” kind of way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Voyagers is playfully curious – delightfully so – right down to who you play as and how you move.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m getting that gripe out of the way up front to set expectations, because outside of the all-too-soon end of the campaign, I love almost everything else about LEGO Voyagers. I’ll start with the tone, which is quite different from Traveller’s Tales’ more whimsical licensed LEGO games and the slapstick-with-heart LEGO movies. Voyagers is instead playfully curious – delightfully so – right down to who you play as and how you move. You and your co-op partner are just nameless, voiceless 1x1 bricks – one red and one blue, both with a single, mildly expressive eyeball attached to one side – and you simply roll your way around the LEGO-built world with fairly believable physics bouncing you around the play spaces. And though it obviously makes no logical sense, you can jump by pressing A (on an Xbox controller) and snap yourself onto any nearby peg with B. Pressing Y rotates your orientation by 90 degrees when you’re in that B-button snap mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually, though, your avatars are not entirely voiceless. Your 1x1 bricks can make adorable little noises if you press the X button, which can occasionally be used to harmonize in certain spots but is more likely intended to get your co-op partner’s attention when playing online. (On that note, kudos to Annapurna for following Hazelight’s lead and offering a Friend’s Pass that allows you to play with a friend online using only one copy of Voyagers.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our adorable 1x1 bricks instantly make for likeable protagonists in an almost Pixar-ish kind of way. I appreciate the little touches, like how the blue one starts with a beach bucket on its “head.” The music – which doesn’t always play but makes an impact when it does – plays a big part in establishing Voyagers’s playful vibe, too. It’s mellow but varied, humming along in the background in a way that’s additive rather than just being forgettable noise. Most, if not all of it, would go on your “Chill” or yoga playlist and not anywhere else, but it totally works here. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bricks That Shine</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to commend the authentic art direction and visual identity of Voyagers, which is decidedly less cartoony compared to the licensed LEGO games. It goes for a sort-of realism, with every piece in the diorama-like worlds looking like the shiny plastic its real-life counterpart is – complete with the LEGO wordmark stamped into every brick. The soft daytime lighting baked into many scenes has a warmth and serenity to it that gives it a relaxing, mellow, and playfully curious tone, and the use of light and shadow helped draw me in immediately. That these sets sometimes have water flowing through them or surrounding them only adds to the believability of these being actually constructed LEGO sets that you’re observing from above as an omniscient participant. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthering that easy-going atmosphere is the complete and total lack of any penalty for death whatsoever; when – not if – you tumble off the edge of a scene or miss a jump and plunge off the side, you’ll instantly reappear right where you last were prior to your mistake. It’s completely low stakes and encourages goofing off, so when you snap yourself onto your co-op partner and roll both of you off a ledge, or fling them off a bridge you’re supposed to be holding down for them to cross, they can’t even be too mad about it until the fifth or sixth time you pull the same trick. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You could build a super-clean bridge that a civil engineer would approve of, or cobble together a hodgepodge of pieces with no regard for aesthetics or efficiency but which gets the job done nonetheless. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s never any direction given, but intuitively we immediately understood that your goal in a game like this is to get from point A to point B. In the early part of the campaign, that’s accomplished by simply picking up loose bricks from around the scene and working together to assemble them into makeshift bridges to cross gaps. In true LEGO spirit, there’s no single right way to build your path forward: You could build a super-clean structure that a civil engineer would approve of, or cobble together a hodgepodge of pieces with no regard for aesthetics or efficiency but which gets the job done nonetheless. We tended toward the latter, and had a great time doing it. (Side note: a Photo Mode would’ve been a nice addition as a way to capture the digital memory of what you create and share it with friends and family – and the act of working together to solve whatever obstacle is in front of you is really enjoyable. But simple screenshots sufficed.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those puzzles ramp up a bit as the campaign progresses, though as I mentioned it felt like there’s a lot more room for it to grow into that it leaves unexplored. A favorite scene of ours had us driving a big dump truck of sorts around an industrial yard where train tracks are made. The locomotive we rode in on had to stop due to a gap in the tracks, so we got out, hopped in the truck with one of us steering while the other (effectively) worked the pedals. We roamed around, collecting raw materials into the truck bed before taking them to the foundry to be forged into usable track pieces, then satisfyingly snapped the new track into place and continued onwards. It’s still simple, but with a few more steps involved than just assembling a bridge or stairway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also had fun with a series of minigames near the end of the story that I won’t spoil here, except to note that they’re particularly finicky physics-based challenges that might be quite tricky for younger gamers that are likely to be drawn to Voyagers and its E-for-Everyone ESRB rating. Fortunately, none of these tricky tasks are required in order to progress – but we did have fun earning the Achievements that came along with completing them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Play Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Though puzzles make up the meat of the gameplay, there’s also a bit of freedom to play around in many scenes. My daughter and I found ourselves racing to be the first to “pop” every flower we came across by rolling over it (and there are a ton of them throughout the entire campaign) even though there are no actual rewards for doing so. There are also fun little “breaks” you can take, such as by each hopping on a teeter-totter or sitting next to each other on a bench. They’re absolutely not required, but they make for fun little pit stops along the golden path (and another idea that those of us who played Split Fiction earlier this year might recognize). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I were to levy one more complaint against LEGO Voyagers, it’s that neither my daughter nor myself quite got what the meaning of the completely wordless story was supposed to be. In the opening moments, the 1x1 brick avatars watch a rocket launch go awry. They spend the next handful of hours trying to get to the rocket facility…and I suppose you’ll see what happens. But if there was a moral to the tale here in the way you might expect from watching Wall-E or playing a game like Tunic, both of us missed it. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-voyagers-review]]></content:encoded>

At various points on social media, Pitchford told people to “code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,” and declare Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.” He also suggested people put their irrational distrust of video game graphics tech such as DLSS aside and use it if available to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s plenty to dig into here, but ultimately what Pitchford is saying is that PC gamers should manage their expectations when it comes to the performance of Borderlands 4 in the context of their own rigs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing,” he said, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicking off a thread</a> clearly designed to address the performance issues that have sparked so much early discourse around Borderlands 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have made an amazing and fun and huge looter shooter campaign game. The game is pretty damn optimal — which means that the software is doing what we want without wasteful cycles on bad processes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford went on to insist that PC gamers have tools that help them balance their preferences between FPS, resolution, and rendering features, and they should make use of them. “If you aren’t happy with the balance between these things you are experiencing, please tune to your preferences using the tools available to you,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Acknowledging everyone is entitled to an opinion, Pitchford insisted it was right for Gearbox to have focused on Borderlands 4’s default settings hitting 30fps on minimum specs, and 60fps on recommended specs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of you would prefer more fps, or more features, or higher resolution. We have provided many tools to help you make those trade offs,” he continued.</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in typical Randy Pitchford on the front foot fashion: “It is a mistake to believe or expect that PCs between minimum specification and recommended specification can achieve all of extremely high framerate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If that last post makes you have a negative reaction, I bet you have emotions and expectations that you feel aren’t sufficiently attended to. I’m sorry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But please accept that the game is doing a lot and running pretty optimally and that you may have to either accept some trade offs between fps, features and resolution as your preference or you will continue to be disappointed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more. Pitchford went on to advise PC gamers should make use of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), Nvidia’s AI-powered image enhancement and rendering technology for GeForce RTX GPUs, downplaying concern about input lag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Use DLSS. It’s great,” he said. “The game was built to take advantage of it. This is not a competitive FPS. And, I have been led to believe that in a blind test that humans cannot detect any input lag. In my own demonstrates and experiments, I believe this is true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone has the freedom to believe what they want to believe and I know on the internet it’s easy to find rage and passionate people who are convinced of all kinds of things, whether they are true or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you are so attached to the idea that DLSS is bad for your game experience because of something you saw or read on the internet, I am sorry. I hope instead you would use the technology designed to give you the experience you want.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/gettyimages-2165616592-1757940049111.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has plenty to say about Borderlands 4 PC performance. Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more, but the rest is pointing out Gearbox is continuing to improve Borderlands 4 and PC performance (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-to-help-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-released-but-there-are-no-patch-notes">there’s an update out although no-one knows what it did</a>), and to thank players for their interest. There are also “a few real issues,” Gearbox is working to fix, but those affect “a very, very small percentage of users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s just one social media thread from Pitchford. There are more on this issue. He <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say customer service reports for Borderlands 4 are roughly 1% of installs, and 0.04% are PC performance related, with CS flagging 0.009% as “valid”  0.037% have experienced success with education (settings coaching).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is less than one percent of one percent (0.01%) of customers using CS tickets for valid performance issues, which is less than 1/5 of the users using CS to get help with Twitch drops,” Pitchford explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the kicker: “This reality is dramatically different than what you would expect if your only sources of information were, say, certain internet threads.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No such assumption made,” Pitchford added in response to one person who pointed out not everyone with PC issues files a ticket. “We are also looking at telemetry in real time regardless of what people report. There are people with low perf and we care about that. But 1% of 1 million is 10,000! Just 1,000 posts feels like everyone the way internet chatter works.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier in the weekend, Pitchford suggested people dead set on playing in 4K resolution should perhaps consider playing at 1440p instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4k with ultra max settings and using two or three-year-old hardware,” he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “You do you, but BL4 and UE5 are doing a lot and for me that trade off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade off - the game looks amazing at 1440p.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4k. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.”</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And there are further quotes, perhaps betraying a touch of frustration from the Gearbox boss. Responding to one person who told Pitchford Gearbox would have been better off building the game for “the most common hardware,” he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>: “Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The minimum and recommended specs are published,” he said. “The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware. Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub-optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is not a game made to run on 10-year-old PCs — this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU. If you’re trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower’s motor, you’re going to be disappointed. If you discover your system can’t run the game well by accident or wishful thinking and/or don’t want to try to mess with settings to make things good enough for you, please use the refund feature on Steam rather than have a subpar experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, responding to one person who said Gearbox should make Borderlands 4 “look good” without using AI upscaling technology, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford hit back with a dose of sarcasm</a>: “Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.  We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know. /sarcasm”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched last week and hit a peak of over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone — a figure significantly higher than any Borderlands game released on Valve’s platform. However, Steam reviews are ‘mixed,’ with most of the complaints revolving around PC performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-%E2%80%93-may-the-quartz-be-with-you.1298127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even in the ranks of nasty little goblins in fiction, Styx is a particularly mean little fellow, but then what would you expect from the grim fantasy world that he was born into? With elves, humans and dwarves all various shades of mean, conniving, and genocidal, it’s not like Styx is morally inferior to those he’s going up against. But now, in Styx: Blades of Greed, he’s not doing it alone.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;| Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZleFS3upA1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Styx has often been able to rely on the help of others in his first two solo adventures, often in an ‘enemy of my enemy’ kind of way, but as Styx looks to escape from the lockdown in place on the human fortress of The Wall, he starts to put together a crew of rapscallions to join him, with a mix of new and returning faces. And what’s the latest object of Styx’s obsession? Well, it’s the power of the Quartz.</p>


<p>Our hands-on picked up right at the beginning of the game, with Styx needing to plot an escape, with a little advice from Helledryn to do so. The Wall is an imposing fortress, built up and up the side of a, well, a giant wall or cliff face, in a fashion that makes Helm’s Deep and Minas Tirith look vertically challenged. Structures sprout out and hang over the rocky abyss below with one of the main ways to get around being to catch a quick zeppelin. But who would ferry a sneaky little goblin around town? Well, maybe you can spring the ship of a drunkard dwarvish captain whose ship has been impounded by the Inquisition?</p>


<p>Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good plan, and lets you get a real feel for the early stages of this game’s stealth action, which is still as broad and flexible as before. Guards tend to go on nicely predictable patrol paths and react in a suitably game-like fashion to make this an enjoyable playground to sneak through, and should react in fairly expected ways to what you try to do. The direct approach is always possible, having Styx slink between cover, get the drop on enemies (often literally from above) and stashing bodies away in boxes as you go. Should you get spotted, you don’t stand much of a chance in one-on-one combat, so it’s best to stay in the shadows, use crawlspaces and more, as well as some extended techniques like poisoning drinking water by just gobbing in it, placing traps, triggering environmental hazards with a goblin clone, possessing guards, and more. If you’re spotted, they put up their hackles for a while, potentially making use of poison gas to try and flush you out of tunnels if they think you just ducked into one, and generally keeping you on your toes.</p>
<p>But Styx: Blades of Greed wouldn’t stop with just retreading the past. In trying to spring the zeppelin from being impounded, Styx needs to break through a Quartz lock, and as he gets some help to do so, he’s drawn to the immense power that this can provide. Also, it starts talking to him with the promise of even more power if he can find more Quartz. What could possibly go wrong here?</p>

<p>As Styx tracks down more shards of Quartz and absorbs their power, he’ll be able to unlock new time-twisting abilities and more that it enables, this coming as a separate skill tree to go alongside the standard Amber skills and crafting recipes he’s learnt. You won’t need the Quartz for some of his other new abilities, though, with a glider that lets you sail through the sky, a grappling hook and claws to climb up taller walls.</p>
<p>This all ties in with a much greater sense of verticality and discoverability through the game’s three environments. The Wall is the home of the humans, while Turquoise Dawn is the more verdant home of the Orcs, and the game will also return to Akenash, the now ruined site of the first title. Each of these regions are going to evolve and open up to you more and more as you unlock those core new movement abilities, so where the first two Styx titles were of a linear structure, Blades of Greed will be more of an evolving open world, replete with key fast travel hot air balloon wharfs.</p>

<p>It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158761/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, you ran a little shop of horrors, dealing plants with an occult edge to the inhabitants of a mysterious dark town. Now, Bad Viking and Iceberg Interactive’s follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, takes us back to Undermere. Again, something strange is afoot. Again, you hear residents’ problems and offer up solutions from your range. Again, there’s a cat you can pat (!) who gets startled by the shop bell.</p>
<p>But this time, instead of being plant-based, the solutions are antique-based. If you enjoyed the first instalment for its puzzles and sinister aura, be sure to reach for this treasure, because it’s just as fun. (Either way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/strange-horticulture">the first game is worth playing</a>.)</p>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, you’re the apprentice of a thaumaturge (a sort of magic miracle-worker) who has left you to run his shop while he investigates peculiar goings-on. He gives you a map of Undermere and a book called 'Strange Artefacts: A guide to occult objects', the latter your bible for working out which among the oddities at your disposal will aid various customers’ misfortunes. And there are shelves on shelves of these otherworldly items: a stag carved of wood, a pendant with a moving eye, a disfigured hand. You know, your usual macabre bric-a-brac.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158760/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much of the play is listening to customers’ requests for mystical antiques. They might be caring for an ailing loved one, or setting out on a journey, or seeking a gift. They might have a particular object in mind, or they’ll just describe the situation and you need to suggest something. You deduce the required trinket by matching the description in your book with the shop’s wares. Clues can be a bit obscure but there are clever hints to help. And when you match each antique successfully, you get more clues, more puzzles. I was so consumed with this gameplay loop that I missed my (IRL) bedtime in my first play session.</p>
<p>Present the wrong antique, however, and you’ll increase a type of anti-health bar. When the meter fills up, you’ll feel ‘a deep fear has taken root’. This takes you to a dice roll minigame where you need to match symbols on dice to those on a board to diminish the fear. It’s quite fun in itself and its spiritual symbols of cats, snakes, suns, moons, etc., feel right at home with the unearthly undercurrent.</p>
<p>But the plot thickens: a customer comes in with a problem and your solution can be one of two items – here the game warns you that your choice will determine the fate of the story. These ethical quandaries arise a few times throughout, and while I won’t spoil anything, I will say I delighted in seeing the consequences of my chosen antiquity.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158766/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around this time the game also opens up new areas and new ways of thinking: you need to procure new items for the store. Dialogue, letters, cards, and other paraphernalia pile on your desk, each hinting at a locale on your map where you can unearth these antiques. This ‘exploration’ doesn’t involve much visual change of scene (the store remains static), but the story unfolds through thrilling Arthur Conan Doyle-style prose.</p>
<p>In that way, the worldbuilding often functions like a visual novel: your imagination is left to fill in the blanks. These moments were when I noticed how masterful the storytelling is, always building intrigue and pulling you through, even when not much is happening on screen. It's impressive that such a rich world fits into such a tiny space.</p>
<p>As you progress, the puzzle ‘pieces’ become more scattered. I found myself cross-referencing various books and tools, and jumping in and out of item inspection. I used my own notes and screenshots to document clues, but it would’ve been nice if findings were logged somewhere in-game.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158765/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, I was never stuck. Whenever I’d feel lost on one puzzle, I’d put it aside and work on another. Lo and behold, the puzzles interlinked and I was able to solve both. This means things flow quite smoothly – making the game all the more addictive.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Strange Antiquities is PC-first. Its point-and-click function longs for a mouse like Tess Sherwood longs for a Horned Shackle, because moving the cursor with the joystick is a bit of a drag. Bad Viking has added options for cursor speed to address this, though I still found the joystick a little laggy. You’d think, then, the game would be an ideal candidate for Switch 2’s mouse feature, but at this stage it’s not supported. So: good ol’ handheld is your friend here – an appropriately cosy way to play.</p>
<p>Along with cursor speed, there’s a good range of settings, such as arachnophobia mode and easy-to-read fonts (unfortunately font size is static, but your magnifying glass can embiggen it). Early Strange Horticulture fans will be excited to enable autolabelling – a blessing for those who find typing on the Switch cursed.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158763/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every artefact, map, and character has been designed with intricate attention to detail – no easy feat when there are so many. The style is dark enough to maintain its arcane leanings, yet cartoonish enough that you know it won't haunt you at night. It strikes the balance of cosy-spooky (or, as my partner says, ‘kooky’). Likewise, the slow tempo and minor-key piano music is a little eerie without being disturbing in a true horror sense; no jumpscares here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, Bad Viking expands the rich world of Strange Horticulture – this time in an antique shop specialising in the occult. The puzzles are cryptic but rarely skull-cracking, forming an addictive gameplay loop: who knew hunting down magic antiques to solve customers’ conundrums could be so satisfying?</p>
<p>The whole thing is cloaked in a gripping mystery narrative, which you can influence with the right (or wrong) occult oddity. And with the possibility of multiple endings, replay value is high – at least for those of you who want to see just how much strangeness is in store.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.1298121/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years and with plenty of solid work, developer Cyanide established the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/">Styx </a>series as one of the most important stealth series still running today, combining a dark fantasy medieval world with a personable main character and some advanced gameplay mechanics to provide experiences like few others. The hardcore approach of the franchise will be turned up to eleven by Styx: Blades of Greed, which is setting out to become the biggest and most complex entry in the series to date.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed in one of the longest session I had booked for this year's show, and, after a brief presentation, it was clear why I was given one hour and half to try out the game. Not counting the sheer size of the open map, which was really massive, featuring a focus on verticality that only opens a lot of possibilities, but also made it feel even bigger, Styx: Blades of Greed is a game that doesn't pull any punches. Though there was a bit of clunkiness to the experience, with some rather complex controls that required a little time to get used to, and enemies sometimes failing to spot Styx even though he was in plain view ahead of them, the experience was as hardcore as it could have been.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed is as hardcore as a stealth game can get.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not counting the above issues, which will likely get ironed out by the time the game comes out, enemies are highly attentive to their surroundings, forcing the player to take advantage of every hiding point or shadow in the environment, and are relentless in their pursuit of Styx if he is discovered, giving up the search only when the goblin is properly concealed, and out of the way. As Styx is not very good at direct combat, a stealthy approach is always the winning one in Styx: Blades of Greed, forcing players to think hard and proceed even more carefully, and to make them take full advantage of the environment by snuffing out candles to create shadows, where he is more difficult to spot, by making noise to distract enemies, or by simply choosing a safer route with fewer enemies. Thanks to a waypoint system, the general area where the main objective is located is easily highlighted, making it easier for players to focus on sneaking around without having to worry about getting lost.</p>



<p>Besides Styx's excellent agility, which allows him to climb pretty much anywhere to take advantage of the aforementioned improved verticality of the maps, the goblin also has many different abilities that can be learned via skill trees. These abilities were extremely varied in the Gamescom demo, ranging from creating clones to fight and distract enemies, setting down a coccoon to be used as a respawn and teleportation point, mind control, and more. These abilities further highlighted how this sandbox approach to level design is a great direction to take the series to, as the massive freedom left to players makes it very involving and engaging. With other tools added to the mix, like a grappling hook and a glider, it will really be interesting to see how stealth game experts will put everything at Styx's disposal to use.</p>



<p>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-director-hollow-knight-silksong-two-week-release-surprise-a-little-callous/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-director-calls-silksong%E2%80%99s-two-week-heads-up-%E2%80%9Ca-little-callous%E2%80%9D.1298118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Excitement and hype have been building around Hollow Knight Silksong's release <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">for years</a>, so it was no surprise when its launch, which occurred 11 days ago at the time of this writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">was a big deal</a>. Several <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games delayed their launches to get out of Silksong's way</a> to try to avoid every ounce of attention being swallowed by Silksong, but others, like Hell is Us, stuck it out, proudly launching alongside Silksong on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that both games are out, and developer Rogue Factor survived the first week and a half of launching alongside Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel, Hell is Us director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had a few thoughts on how Team Cherry handled launching the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>I mean, they're allowed to do what they did,</em>" began Jacques-Belletête when answering what it was like finding out they'd be releasing the same day as Silksong on an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y">Friends Per Second</a> podcast per <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">TWIV</a>. "<em>There's no laws or rules against that. And I don't want to get into, 'Oh they caused this to us or somebody else.' I don't really care about that, and I don't want to get into that type of debate. But I do, it's hard for me not to say, like, when you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like wow. You know what I mean? As the GTA VI of indie, right? And I know now this term gets thrown around left and right, but people in the industry, that's how we were</em> <em>calling such a game. To shadow drop something like this is a little callous.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="'Hell is Us' Game Director on what worked (and didn't) | Friends Per Second Ep #78" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opeNl55y-0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jacques-Belletête also confirmed that there were conversations between Rogue Factor and its publisher, Nacon, regarding whether Hell is Us should be delayed, and that while it wasn't the deciding factor, at least one point of friction against that decision would be having to refund pre-orders, and hope those players purchase them again for the new date.</p>



<p>"<em>The real pain in the ass is that you have to refund your pre-orders when you do that, right? That's the real, 'How you gonna do this?' now you need to rebuild them. We didn't say 'Oh my god, we have to do it but we can't because of that.' We were like, 'No, I think we can get through the storm.'"</em></p>



<p>Obviously, Hell is Us kept its date, which Jacques-Belletête says he was "<em>happy</em>" about, and noted that Rogue Factor is still a larger studio than several of the other indies that delayed their games, which went into the team believing they could weather the storm of Silksong.</p>



<p>But while he doesn't have any hard numbers, it's his belief that Silksong did impact the launch sales of Hell is Us. "<em>I don't have any specific numbers, at least not at this time. But for sure it did</em>." He continued to say that it's not just about Hollow Knight, but about how it's practically impossible to find a release window where you aren't going up against a big upcoming title.</p>



<p>"<em>That's the thing nowadays, getting a window where you're pretty much alone</em> <em>is almost impossible. 15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness</em>."</p>



<p>When we start looking at sales reports for September, it'll be interesting to see where Hell is Us lands on the charts, especially if it lands within a few places of Silksong. As Jacques-Belletête pointed out, there are no laws against what Team Cherry did, and it's difficult for everyone in the industry, no matter who you are, to draw the ever-shrinking attention spans of modern players away from the hundreds of other options they have to any one game. But it seems odd to even suggest that Team Cherry, or any other studio in its place, owes other studios the courtesy of a long lead time. </p>



<p>Team Cherry launched Hollow Knight Silksong in the way that it did with the intention of getting as many eyes as possible on it for September 4. Rogue Factor did the same with its own strategy. Is that callousness, or competitiveness?</p>



<p>For more on Hell is Us,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/"> you can check out my review</a>, in which I noted that despite a few flaws, Rogue Factor is largely able to succeed at what it is trying to do with Hell is Us, and that it is overall "<em>one of the 2025's best games</em>."</p>

            <p>By the great transport gods, trolleymageddon is upon us! It's the end of the line as we know it, and I feel fine. All of that is to say that two wacky trolley-related games are releasing within days of each other, no doubt driving fans of the budding genre off the rails or road.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>, a game about a famous philosophical quandary and also at least one tale of a girl falling deeply in love with a tram, pulled up at this stop on September 12th. Boarding costs £5.20/$6.49/€6.33 right now, or £5.40 if you want the deluxe edition the comes with a mysterious and possibly satirical DLC dubbed '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3550600/The_Trolley_olution/">the V.I.P. lever</a>'. If you hurry, you can probably still catch it! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731330/TROLEU/">Troleu</a>, a game that tasks you with checking tickets and occasionally kicking the bottoms of troublemakers as a trolleybus conductor, is due to pull up on the opposite side of the stop later today, September 15th. Make sure you've got your ticket ready!</p>
<p>If you opt to get on The Trolley Solution's tram, which is named Trolley-San, you're in for a series of amusing scenarios/puzzles based around Phillipa Foot's famous trolley problem. You know, the one with the unstoppable train speeding towards a point at which some tracks separate, with some unfortunate folks strapped to the rails of both forks, and a lever presenting the chance to save one group at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>As I discovered when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trolley-solution-is-a-moral-quandary-that-suddenly-turns-into-a-tragically-touching-tale-of-tram-love">gave its demo a go back in June</a>, The Trolley Solution takes that scenario in a whole bunch of wacky directions, including one which politely requests permission to tweet something highly controversial about footwear from your Twitter account. That's probably less of a threat if you're solely on BlueSky or have smartly given up the socials. Also, this happens:</p>
<blockquote>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough - are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</blockquote>
<p>Given the updated Steam page images feature the likes of a person pushing a tram up an incline like Sisyphus, I can only assume the full version's even wackier.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>andrground</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, meanwhile, is a bus conductor sim with attitude. Lest you accuse me of falsifying its trolleyness, the Steam description insists on a couple of occasions that this is a "trolleybus". I've no idea what the difference between the two is, but our Nic liked the demo when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/troleus-demo-is-for-anyone-whos-ever-wanted-to-physically-kick-someone-out-of-a-moving-bus">gave it a go back in June</a>. That said, while he enjoyed lobbing folks with fake passes out of the doors "at which point they fly off down the street like a crisp packet in a gale", he was neutral about the child kicking you can do if you wish. Here's his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>To keep you on your toes, there's both a passenger annoyance meter and your own boss, the ticket inspector, to contend with, who makes sure you haven't been letting on fare dodgers. I am as yet not fully convinced there is more than 15 minutes of fun here but it is a very good 15 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>Right, now pick your transport and get on. Or, divide yourself in two somehow and board both. Or board neither and stay home to play something else. The choice, as when dealing with tram quandaries and ornery passengers, is yours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can make streaming all your favorite movies and shows a seamless experience with the help of a Fire TV. Specifically, the Fire TV Cube which is the most feature-packed streaming device in Amazon’s lineup. Right now, Amazon, has it marked down by a solid 29%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Normally, you’d find the Fire TV Cube going for $140, but after the discount, it comes down to just $100</a>. That’ll save you a whole $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Streaming Experience</h2>
<p>Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What’s better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It’s sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick’s Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you’re asking. But what if you’re all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way <em>over there</em>? Now you see the value.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max—the premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.</p>



<p>With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that’s what it’s called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.</p>
<p>You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you’re ready to try again against Sister Splinter in&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.&nbsp;</em>Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of<em> Bob’s Burgers</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon’s Fire TV Cube. You’ll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios has reiterated that the plan for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s cosmetics is to remain "gritty" and "grounded" as opposed to embracing more wacky and weird skins that games like Call of Duty and Fortnite are known for.</p><p>Technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson recently elaborated on these points in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official PC Features Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Buhl went on to say any game is free to "be whatever they want to be," saying Fortnite is a "pretty good" game with its "goofy" skins.</p><p>"So, I think where we end up is we're pretty happy with where we are. We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter. That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while," Buhl said.</p><p>Buhl ending that comment with "for a while" is causing some Battlefield fans to panic and theorize that Battlefield 6 will launch without weird skins and then add them later. Evidence of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">non-traditional cosmetics have already leaked, after all</a>, prompting some people to wonder about what comes next.</p><p>Nickerson, for their part, said Battlefield Studios examines the competition and understands the competitive landscape that Battlefield 6 will join this October. However, Nickerson said, "We're really focused on what works for Battlefield at the end of the day. We're not chasing trends. We're not chasing other products."</p><p>Nickerson said people can look at the Road to Battlefield 6 event in Battlefield 2042 to get a "taste" of the kinds of cosmetics that will come to Battlefield 6 down the road.</p><p>"Generally, I think, from a design perspective, we're doing us. We're staying in our lane, doing us at the end of the day," Nickerson said.</p><p>Before this, Battlefield Studios specifically mentioned how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-have-grounded-skins-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj/1100-6533627/" data-ref-id="1100-6533627">Battlefield 6 aims to have "grounded" skins and purposefully avoid Nicki Minaj</a>. Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> hasn't exactly been off to a flying start. While it's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/">developed a healthy playerbase</a>, Steam reviews have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/">not been so hot</a>, primarily due to the game's performance issues. But it's not just PC players that are having trouble, as many players on console have been clamouring for a field-of-view slider option. And based on a recent tweet, it looks like such an option might be on the way.</p><p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966626024235434322" rel="nofollow ">shared a poll over the weekend</a> on his personal X account asking console players about including a FOV setting. He noted that there are "some dreams" he has "where an FOV setting might affect fairness," but also said he couldn't talk about that. It seems like that didn't matter to most folks though, as the top rated result in the poll was "FOV slider or GTFO!" Following that, a post from the official Borderlands X account was shared essentially confirming that the devs will be looking into adding that in as an option.</p>

		<p>Following its early access release for PC and Xbox last year, Maximum Entertainment has confirmed that the city builder with superpowers Overthrown will launch on October 16th for PS5, and exit out of early access on PC and Xbox Series X|S the same day. Overthrown lets up to six players work together to build a world, and whoever wears the crown wields the powers of super strength and super speed to find resources and place buildings.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overthrown - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/28mx1hgDWP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Overthrown begins you are put in a world where there is no city, just wildlife and bandits stalking the wilderness. Armed with your crown, you are tasked with building a town and attracting people to come live in your town, making it grow from a small village to a bustling town. Of course, that kind of growth has it danger and can attract attacks from the wild. You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012237">Overthrown</a> on the PS Store, or get it in early access for £20.99 on Steam and Xbox Series XS now.</p>

<p>In our Overthrown Early Access review, I said, <em>“Overthrown certainly has potential but after just a few hours I felt like I had seen all I could see in the Early Access stage, at least until the next batch of new content is added in January. It doesn’t take long to unlock all the research available and once you have the town starting to thrive you’re waiting for raids to hit or explore a big but rather sparse world. Regular content updates will be needed to keep people invested in their worlds, otherwise the inhabitants will face more than a harsh winter.”</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-chapter-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-chapter-5-not-coming-in-2026s-first-half-chapter-6-officially-confirmed.1298079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has revealed that the game's fifth chapter isn't going to be ready until at least the second half of next year, but there's some good news as well: a sixth chapter has officially been confirmed.</p>

<p>As part of the game's <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fall newsletter</a>, Fox says that he "[doesn't] think that the game will be released in the first half of 2026", presumably referring to&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s fifth chapter rather than to the game as a whole.</p>

<p>He says that as of September 8th this year, Chapter 5's early areas are complete but in need of polish for some optional areas, while the last 40% of the chapter is in a "rough first pass" state, with the final 10% currently being prototyped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=s5szU5gM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=r3oxRAbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 5 won't be along until the second half of next year at the earliest.</figcaption></figure><p>The newsletter also contains the first official confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 6; Fox says that "one programmer is already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6", with regular enemies in Chapter 5 being "mostly done".</p>

<p>It was already fairly obvious that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>would have at least two more chapters following Chapter 5. The game's chapter selection screen shows space for seven chapters, but this is the first time Fox has overtly referred to a sixth chapter for&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, he doesn't provide any kind of timeline for Chapter 6's release; since Chapter 5 doesn't have a release date yet, it would perhaps be strange if Fox knew when its followup would arrive.</p>

<p>In the case of Chapter 5, Fox says he and his team will release it "when it's done", and that he'll continue to update expectant fans on the progress of the chapter as it's made. Hopefully, it won't be too long until the next update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=HD6mVzkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=V19o4CWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A sixth chapter of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>is officially in development.</figcaption></figure><p>Fox has traditionally been pretty transparent about&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s development. Back in October last year, he promised that the game's third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">would definitely release this year</a>, which was subsequently confirmed during a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>He's also pledged in the past that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">development would be "smoother"</a> following relatively lengthy waits for the game's first few chapters, so hopefully, Chapters 5 and 6 will arrive in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s first four chapters on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deltarune/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

            <p>
I'm not sure the just-released Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream is one of those "good games" you're all so bloody obsessed with. My working summary, based on 30 minutes with the demo, is that it's an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">Like A Dragon/Yakuza game</a> developed with a fraction of the budget, and set in "fictionalised" Indonesia. That's to say, it's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> comedy beat 'em up with a bunch of other genres haphazardly stirred in. 
</p>
<p>
I compared it to Rockstar's work and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-dying-light-a-martian-themepark-sim-a-glossy-rpg-remake-and-some-cuddly-lego-co-op">this week's Maw</a>, which was Mostly Wrong. This is a predominantly on-foot experience, for one thing, and you can't grievously assault people at random. There are designated gangs of hoodlums you're permitted to punch out, and as far as I can tell, you have to wait for them to Make Trouble first. It seems very polite and passive for a brawler. Also, you get to transform briefly into a dying cow.

<p>
I'm writing up the demo partly because "Troublemaker" is a brilliant name for an urban sandbox brawl-me-do. Such boisterous Beano energy. Petition to call the next Call Of Duty "Bang Street Kids" and the next Doom "Marine the Minx". The previous Troublemaker from 2023 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498740/Troublemaker/">which was pretty well reviewed</a>) took place in a high school - and what is a city, I guess, but a larger school with fancier social dynamics and also, roaming delinquent students called "cars" that waste you instantly on contact. I'm interested to see how far they can extend this "troublemaking" concept. Could we perchance Make Trouble in outer space?</p><p>I'm also writing this up because while I'm not very sold on the button-mashy core combat system, I'm quite struck by the setting. The demo map is a believable jumble of spaces, their disorder amplified by film grain and pop-up. There are neon sculpture trails, pavements lined with scooters, courtyards roamed by lonely broom pushers, half-constructed concert stages, and noisy backstreets where random guys stand on crates twerking. That last one could be a bug.</p>

<p>It feels like a celebration of somebody's neighbourhood. Sadly, you can't enter all the shops and coo over local brands of fast food - often, you're treated to an anime illustration of a shopkeeper. I sound like a massive stinking tourist, I know. I've only ever been to Indonesia in videogames, the last one being the very different <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/afterlove-ep-review">Afterlove EP</a>.
</p><p>
One early hurdle to overcome is the humour. I'm not sure if it's innately awful or poorly localised in English. Possibly, it's both. Example: dropping straight into one of the demo's free roam modes, I approach a man fishing from a bridge. We've barely exchanged hellos when his wife runs up and castigates him for fishing all day. She makes unflattering reference to his "pole" and bullies him back to work with the threat of withholding "our nightly spicy time". I am left alone on the bridge with nothing but questions. And a pole. I try my hand at some fishing myself, but lose interest when I fail the QTE.
</p>

The jokes do improve in the course of my demo, however uneven the English translation. Subsequently, I meet the aforementioned dying cow, slumped on a corner with a gaggle of onlookers. I moo at the cow sympathetically. The cow tells me that I'm rubbish at speaking cow. This cow, it turns out, has been "gifted by God with critical thinking", and yet now its sorry fate is to be butchered and cooked into rendang.

<p>
I ask whether the cow has any final wishes, and it asks me to pass laws punishing corrupt government officials who steal money intended for 5G towers, or something to that effect. I sense that there may be a joke I'm missing here about Indonesian politics (for context: the game's start-up disclaimer puts the word "fiction" in air quotes). I am unable to pass any laws in the demo, so the cow settles for asking me to help it go on a rampage. There follows a minigame in which <em>I</em> am the cow, barging through cars that conveniently burst like soapbubbles.
</p><p>
Aside from brute catharsis, the tragic bovine encounter also furnishes me with some important background knowledge. Shortly afterwards, another sidequest sees me answering trivia questions posed by a couple of blokes doing a vox pop livestream of some kind. What's rendang made of, they ask? Aha! I know this! That cow was complaining about it earlier!</p>
<p>I somehow score full marks on the quiz, or at least, that's what the NPCs tell me. I celebrate by getting into some lumbering and disconnected brawls with mysteriously hostile dudes in vests, involving light and heavy attacks and parries when I can be bothered. Then I decide that it's time to report back with my findings. It's a deflating end to a demo in which I got to rampage through not-Jakarta as a cow.
</p>
<p>
Troublemaker 2 won't be toppling the likes of Yakuza Zero anytime soon, but it has a similar sense of abandon and generosity. Going by the demo, at least, it's a joyfully ungainly Xmas panto of a game, all glitter and gags and wonky stage punches. Creators Gamecom Team started out as a high school project in 2014, and have also made a bunch of Troublemaker games for mobile. I think I've Made enough Trouble for the foreseeable, but I'm rooting for them. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479770/Troublemaker_2_Beyond_Dream/">Read more on Steam</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>With action-RPGs, it's not uncommon for players to discover character builds that do a little <em>too much </em>damage than initially intended. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 players leveraged the power of the Stendhal build</a> to wipe the floor with enemies until developer Sandfall Interactive toned down the damage, and Bungie has nerfed numerous Guardian builds over the years, much to the annoyance of the game's fanbase. Borderlands has often been an exception to that school of thought, as players have discovered killer combos between weapons, gear, and skills that have helped them overcome tough fights. These have rarely been patched, as additional difficulty modes have helped keep players on their toes instead.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is out right now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and while the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/">has reached an impressive number of concurrent players</a> on Steam, it has also been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/">slammed with negative user reviews</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S </a>version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was challenging due to the console's technical limitations, but optimizing the game for the system ultimately made the game better and more stable.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a>, Technical Director Christian Buhl commented on the challenges of developing the sixth entry in the series launching next month on the Microsoft system, saying that the biggest challenge was dealing with the console's limited memory, which was less than that of the studio's mid-spec PCs, and that caused crashing issues in a lot of the levels. Due to these issues, the team focused on optimizing memory usage in Battlefield 6, and these improvements were also applied to the other versions of the game, resulting in a better and more stable game. The specific optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version also didn't take a very long time, as the memory issues were reportedly fixed in one month or two, according to Buhl.</p>



<p>Although the Battlefield 6 developer managed to find an opportunity in the development challenges the Xbox Series S poses with its technical limitations compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S, many more developers have found these challenges to be a serious issue not easily solved. One of these developers is Saber Interactive, which hasn't managed to make the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/">Turok: Origins</a> run at 60 FPS on the system. Memory limitations were one of the reasons why <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took a long time to release on Xbox systems. For the latter to launch on Xbox systems, Microsoft had to amend its parity clause and let Larian launch their games without split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S, which was later added to this version of the game with a patch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Performance Is "Pretty Damn Optimal", Says Randy Pitchford]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-performance-is-pretty-damn-optimal-says-randy-pitchford.1298037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has been paying attention to comments about&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance since it launched this past Friday, and he's got a characteristically brusque suggestion for you if you're dissatisfied.</p>

<p>As part of a very lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">string of posts</a> on social media platform X over the weekend (which also included multiple threads and responses to other users), Pitchford told one user who suggested&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>should "look good without relying on AI upscal[ing]" to "code [their] own engine".</p>

<p>Pitchford suggested the user "show [Gearbox] how it's done", sarcastically suggesting that those currently working on the game's technical side are "clearly dumb and don't know what they're doing", and that "the world's greatest" technical staff "don't seem to know what [the user seems] to know".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-comments-character.jpg?itok=b_ycA7dQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-comments-character.jpg?itok=GqinSjS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you unsatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance? Randy Pitchford reckons you should "code your own engine".</figcaption></figure><p>For context,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report" rel="nofollow">launched on Friday</a>, has attracted a Mixed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user review score</a> on Steam, with the majority of negative reviews pointing to sub-optimal performance as their reason for scoring the game negatively.</p>

<p>Some users are suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>runs poorly on hardware that's pretty new in PC terms, although others say that features like DLSS and frame generation alleviate the problem significantly.</p>

<p>Pitchford himself <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recommends</a> that players use DLSS, since&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was "built to take advantage of it", dismissing criticisms of input latency and describing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance on PC as "pretty damn optimal". He suggests PC gamers should "tune to [their] preferences using the tools available".</p>

<p>Despite these comments, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>did receive <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an update</a> over the weekend, and that said update was intended to address "stability for a wide range of PCs", so it does look like Gearbox and publisher 2K intend to address these performance issues.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to come under fire for lackluster PC performance in recent years.</p>

<p>Others include the likes of Capcom's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement" rel="nofollow">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, as well as indie titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, although none of these games are built on Unreal Engine 5, which some&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players are blaming for the game's issues.</p>

<p>In any case, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and make sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4" rel="nofollow">our interview with Randy Pitchford</a> to find out how the game came together.</p>

Within the first Galaxy game, Rosalina's backstory is revealed through pages of a storybook, with her journey through the stars explained as her searching for her long-lost parents. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rosalina's parentage is kept vague, with her mother pictured but kept largely obscured. But Nintendo is said to have once planned a more concrete backstory that linked Rosalina and the Mushroom Kingdom, with her being related to Princess Peach in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Years later, eagle-eyed fans spotted a mysterious tease within 2023's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, in a scene which sees Peach discuss her origins, and reveal how she first arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You don't seem like you're from here," Mario says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't know where I'm from," Peach replies. "My earliest memory is arriving," she continues, as a flashback shows her, aged as a toddler, turning up in the Mushroom Kingdom via a warp pipe. Dressed in a skirt decorated with stars and moons, she is quickly found by a group of Toads. "I was so lucky they found me. They took me in, raised me like one of their own, and when I was ready they made me their princess."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/peach1-1757935750838.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Peach arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom, wearing a skirt featuring stars and moons.

Mario suggests, though Peach seems to disagree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies," she hints, as the camera pulls back to focus on the night sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a moment some fans believe is a nod towards Peach's own galactic origins — and with it, the link between her and Rosalina that Nintendo ultimately shied away from confirming long ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario games are not known for their story, and Super Mario Galaxy's director Yoshiaki Koizumi has admitted he wrote Galaxy's storybook in secret each evening, after other developers had left the office. Ultimately, he surprised even Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto with the idea, and an adapted version of his plans was ultimately included. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/peach2-1757935750839.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies." Image credit: Nintendo/Illumination/Universal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without further detail on that link between the two characters, and with Nintendo seemingly keen to keep things vague, fans have been left to debate whether Peach might have once been planned as Rosalina's mother (or even the other way around), or alternatively if the pair were intended as siblings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Has Nintendo now softened its stance on keeping Rosalina's story a secret? Last week's Nintendo Direct also provided some clues. Koizumi and Miyamoto both appeared, with the former announcing a physical version of Galaxy's storybook as a tie-in product, and that additional storybook pages would be included for the first time in the Switch 2 re-releases of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Super Mario Galaxy Movie headed into space next year, fans may finally get some answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
