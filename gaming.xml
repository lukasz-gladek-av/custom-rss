            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-us-dod-list-chinese-military<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Defense has added Chinese gaming giant to a list of companies allegedly aiding the Chinese military, a decision that Tencent itself calls a "mistake".</p>

<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Tencent was added to the DOD's list alongside battery manufacturer CATL, causing the shares of both companies to drop. Tencent's stocks fell by 7.3%, while CATL's dropped by just 2.8%.</p>

<p>The Reuters report goes on to say that Tencent responded to the DOD's decision by calling it a "mistake" and suggesting that its business would be unaffected by the move. The Chinese gaming giant also suggested it would begin legal proceedings if necessary.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=k9rKb54p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=00MChtj- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has its fingers in plenty of pies, including&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>As Reuters points out, the list, which is officially known as the Section 1260H list, doesn't prohibit Tencent from doing business in the US, so it's unlikely to have any material impact on the company's dealings in the short term.</p>

<p>However, having a presence on the list can sometimes serve as a blow to a company's reputation in the US, which could prevent other companies from wanting to do business with Tencent.</p>

<p>Given just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">how many pies</a> Tencent has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">its fingers in</a> across <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">the gaming industry</a>, it's unlikely that there will be a mass exodus of studios breaking their agreements with the Chinese gaming giant, but this still likely won't come as pleasing news to the company.</p>

<p>As for what Tencent is up to outside of its addition to this list, the studio is busy working with developers both Western and non-Western on a number of different projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=RZb13lX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=6ZHFnuW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has plenty of projects on the go.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming giant is currently working with Capcom on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, and it's also behind the extremely&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon</em>-coded&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which was unveiled in full back in November.</p>

<p>Tencent is also attracting talent like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">joined subsidiary LightSpeed Studios</a> recently (but not the branch that's currently working on&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, another Tencent project</a>).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/virtuos-is-working-on-an-unannounced-remake-using-unreal-engine-5.1076022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A developer’s LinkedIn profile has revealed that Virtuos is working on an unannounced remake for current generation consoles using Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>First spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the information comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksii-moskovchenko-17278017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oleksii Moskovchenko</a>‘s LinkedIn page, who is a Technical Art Director at Virtuos. His description of his current work simply reads, “unannounced UE5 PS5/XSX/PC remake.”</p>



<p>In December 2024, several rumors began to circulate that Virtuos would be developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further corroborated by leak Extas1s, who said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game could be announced at the heavily rumored Xbox Direct</a>, which is believe to take place in January. </p>



<p>While some find it somewhat hard to believe that Virtuos could be developing a fully-fledged remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5, the proof is seemingly starting to stack up. For those out of the loop, a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which the game expected to release during the fiscal year of 2022 – a date that has obviously been missed.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we shouldn’t have long to wait to know if the rumors are true if the announcement is set to come during the Xbox Direct, which WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden also <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1876466327583621306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently claimed</a> would be announced very soon. </p>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was first released in 2006 and has sold an estimated 9.5 million copies worldwide, according to the market research firm Electronic Entertainment Design and Research. </p>



<p>For those waiting on the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls 6, well, unfortunately, that one is still years away from release.</p>



<p>What do you think of the current rumors? Do you think Virtuos is developing The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5? Let us know down below, and be sure to join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

It’s only a short teaser, clocking in at just under a minute, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any shots, scenes, and characters that are worth taking a closer look at. From a grief-ridden hospital corridor to an anger-harbouring, red-drenched hospital corridor, we’ve got you covered (as well as some other non-corridor-related details).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, we already did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-two-game-references-and-new-theories-from-the-trailer">full in-depth breakdown of the first Season Two trailer</a> back in 2024, so you can read more about some of our theories about how the show might deviate from The Last of Us Part 2 game there. And we even had a go at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-predicting-season-2">predicting how this upcoming HBO season will play out</a> if you’re in the mood for pure (educated) guesswork. But stay here if you want to check out the five new details, as well as comparisons between the show and Naughty Dog’s original game that we’ve picked out from the brand-new trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Abby’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/1-1736254769934.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the teaser opens we get our first glimpse at the aftermath of The Last of Us’ most pivotal scene. An abandoned hallway, bathed by a flashing red light, is soundtracked by an alarm sound that will no doubt send shivers down the spine of anyone who has played the game. Chronologically, this takes place moments after Joel’s fateful decision to rescue Ellie from the Fireflies at the end of season one. We see a panicked Abby – portrayed here by Kaitlyn Dever – walk down the corridor leading to the operating theater of St Louis’ fictional St Mary’s Hospital. In that room, she’ll find the body of her dad, the surgeon whom Joel murdered to save Ellie. It’s the action that sets the wheel in motion for Part 2’s and (we assume) Season 2’s story of spiraling revenge and violence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Ellie’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/2-1736254801696.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of revenge and violence, that is exactly what is taking place in this scene just before the trailer ends, which shows Bella Ramsey’s Ellie bathed in red light in a corridor at Lakehill Seattle Hospital. This is almost certainly a replication of the moment in The Last of Us Part 2 when, having cornered one of Abby’s accomplices, Nora, Ellie proceeds to unleash what can only be described as a ferocious assault on her pleading victim. It’s a real turning point for Ellie in the game’s story as we really see for the first time how unstable she has become, and the uncomfortable lengths she’ll go in search of vengeance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Sickle Sneak Peek</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/3-1736254830311.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 is consistently incredibly violent, even by its predecessor’s standards, and 20 seconds into the teaser we get our first look at a bladed sickle weapon, which presumably belongs to one of the Seraphites. Also known as Scars, this cult-like faction from the game favors more workman-like weaponry such as hammers, machetes, bows, and, in this case, sickles. This may seem like a really tenuous detail, but this specific tool of destruction (or harvesting if that’s more your speed) plays a key role late in The Last of Us Part 2’s story. In a brutal showdown with a pickaxe-wielding Seraphite heavy, Abby achieves bloody victory with a Sickle, tearing apart the Seraphite’s face in a sequence that’s frequently harrowing. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. A Better Look at Isaac</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/4-1736254874896.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the 21 second mark we get a lovely close-up of Jeffrey Wright, who plays Isaac Dixon, the leader of the Washington Liberation Front; a paramilitary organisation that Abby works with.  Following in the footsteps of Season 1 actor Merle Dandridge (who played Marlene), Wright actually reprises his role from the game, where he provided voice and motion-capture for Dixon in The Last of Us Part 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A complicated character consumed by conflict (as many in this story are), Dixon doesn’t get a ton of screen time in the game. Here’s hoping we get a bit more of him in the show, as well as more of that fetching beard and knitwear combo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Last Dance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/5-1736254930006.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, at 24 seconds in, we get a look at one of the most memorable scenes from across both The Last of Us games – the Jackson dance. Dina, played in the HBO show by Alien Romulus’ Isabela Merced, can be seen embracing Ellie in a scene that will spark their romance. It’s a real warm moment of tenderness amongst the cold hopelessness that the rest of the story projects, which is likely why it endures as such a memorable moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if the chronology of events is being played around with here. In The Last of Us Part Two, the dance occurs right at the end of the story in flashback form, but we already know that Season 2 of the show is not going to reach that far into the timeline. The fact that we’re seeing it here in the trailer suggests that Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin might be tweaking the order we see these scenes, perhaps to help cement the emotional stakes of Ellie’s journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t have to wait long to see what changes, if any, have been made to The Last of Us Part Two’s story, though, with Season 2 of the show only a few months away now. What are you most excited to see in the upcoming episodes? Let us know in the comments below.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling memories of Sony’s infamous Killzone 2 reveal E3 2005 trailer, this Virtual Fighter video is a concept only, although it is “in-engine.” The animations on display are beyond what we’ve seen from fighting game gameplay in other titles, and the speed and fluidity of the movement is a step beyond normal fighting game gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega, though, made clear that what we’re seeing here should not be considered Virtua Fighter 6 gameplay, stressing: “Please note that this is a concept video created before development began. The actual gameplay and characters may differ from what is shown.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Virtua Fighter fans are excited by the return of the legendary series and the prospect that its visuals may approach the level we’re seeing in this concept video. “If they somehow manage to get the animations to look even remotely close to this in the final game, that'd be insane,” said one fan. “Regardless, I'm excited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6 is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>CES 2025 is officially underway, and one of the big gaming announcements so far was a partnership between Nvidia and Krafton for AI-powered teammates who can help you in battle in PUBG.</p><p>Nvidia and Krafton created what they are calling CPCs, or co-playable characters. These characters use artificial intelligence to fight alongside you. This feature is called called PUBG Ally, and the CPC is apparently smart enough to play like a human would. You can say something like, "Hey Ally, I'm looking for a level 3 vest and 5.56 ammo." The CPC will then search the map and try to find it for you. The PUBG Ally can also spot enemies and cover you, locate nearby vehicles, and speak back to you with an AI-powered voice. You can see some of the test footage in action below.</p><p>Note that what you're seeing in the video is representative of R&amp;D gameplay. The PUBG Ally feature <a href="https://x.com/PUBG/status/1876554285745606665" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hasn't actually been greenlit yet</a> and may never come to PUBG.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Transform solo gameplay into a seamless team experience with PUBG Ally. 🎮<br>KRAFTON and NVIDIA have teamed up to create the world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC), built with NVIDIA ACE.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/jAaibitkgq" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jAaibitkgq</a></p>  — NVIDIAGameDev (@NVIDIAGameDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Krafton's Sims-like inZOI will also make use of this new CPC feature, though no footage or any other details were revealed as of yet.

Krafton CEO CH Kim said this new AI technology will "revolutionize the gaming industry," while Nvidia boss Keita Iida said, "AI is transforming the way games are created and played."</p><p>Plenty of people remain skeptical about how AI could actually shake up video games, in part because AI is nothing new at all in the world of gaming.

            <title><![CDATA[Manba One Gaming Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/manba-one-gaming-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manba-one-gaming-controller-review.1075989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/manba-one-gaming-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As the festive season grinds to a close, there’s still new bits of tech popping up to enhance your current gaming setup – or perhaps to help you out with whatever was sat underneath the Christmas tree. The Manba One controller instantly falls into that category, with an enhanced ‘pro’ style experience at a very reasonable price point.</p>
<p>Before you pick it up, the Manba One sets itself apart from the pack with two very key inclusions. The first are customisable RGB strips down each side of the controller, with a batch of different colour schemes and effects to choose from. The second, and perhaps more obvious feature is the screen that’s slap-bang in the middle of the controller, giving you instant access to a batch of customisation options and ways to tweak the controller’s performance. It’s a setup we’ve also seen in the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Controller, but where that costs £180, the Manba One comes in at £75, making it much gentler on the pocket.</p>



<p>The Manba One offers both Bluetooth and wireless connections via its USB-A dongle, happily playing with PC, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android. Interestingly, those are the platforms that many of these controllers are aiming for, which makes sense when Sony and Microsoft don’t like to share their technology with others and have very specific requirements when they do.</p>
<p>The Manba One is available in black or a transparent white and silver colour scheme like our review unit. It looks and feels quite smart in the hand, and overall apes the official Xbox controller shape, with a few changes here and there. The top case is exceptionally smooth, almost to the point of being slippery, but the underside of the controller has textured plastic to ensure you don’t lose your grip. There are little windows in each handhold so you can see the rotating rumble motors inside, and alongside the screen and the RGB lighting, this is a great looking controller.</p>

<p>Included in the box is a smart charging dock, and the Manba One gives a satisfying beep when you pop it on there. Using it means it’s always ready to go and you always know where you’ve left it, and I really appreciated the experience of using the controller and dock. There is a massive downside here though, and that’s that the wireless dongle does not connect to the dock, requiring its own USB slot, meaning that if you want to use the Manba One in the most sensible way, you’re giving up two USB slots, rather than one. It makes even less sense when the dock has a little space for the dongle to go, but only for storage.</p>

<p>The main control layout is largely the same as the Xbox controller , though the first key improvement over its inspiration is the inclusion of Hall Effect sticks, whose frictionless magnetic tech should mean that they never develop stick drift, and will last a great deal longer than traditional controllers. A great first step. From there, the main face buttons are fitted with microswitches, improving response time, and providing a lovely click into the bargain. The D-pad is responsive, though it’s merely ‘alright’ in terms of feel and useability, while the shoulder buttons feel sturdy and swift.</p>
<p>The triggers is where you find another key improvement, with the inclusion of lockout switches to shorten the travel hopefully improving your response time, and bumping your Overwatch or Call of Duty kill ratio in the process. On the reverse there are also four programmable extra buttons, and they sit relatively well under your fingers. They are a tiny bit small and cramped for my hands, but I feel that’s entirely subjective.</p>
<p>The button placement that I cannot get on with though, is the row of Menu/Options/Home buttons along the front panel. Even after weeks of playing with the Manba One, I still can’t get it into my head that these sit at the bottom of the controller rather than the top, making every hop into a map or the menus an extra struggle. I understand why they’re there, I just don’t like it, reminding me of the Onlive controller from years ago.</p>
<p>The screen is really the Manba One’s party trick, and gives you immediate access to your connection settings and RGB colour schemes as well as the button configuration – including multiple button inputs – joystick curves and dead zones, trigger response points and vibration strength. It’s all very easy to get your head around too, and I really appreciated not having to dive into an app in order to make changes. This sets the Manba One apart from the rest of the pack, especially at this price point.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a great deal of time with the Manba One, mainly playing Overwatch, and things have really been going my way since shifting to it. Some of that may be that I’m getting better at the game – who knew that playing something for a long time makes you better at it? – but the Manba One definitely holds up well to competitive play, and has a batch of features that I found increasingly useful.</p>
<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra is the key competition here, and while it is undoubtedly a nicer-feeling controller, I’m not convinced that it offers twice the performance of the Manba One in line with the jump in price. Alternatively, there’s the Gamesir Tarantula Pro that’s also launched recently, which has some of its own special skills – like being able to move the buttons to a Switch layout – but misses out on the on-the-fly customisation that the screen gives you.</p>

<p>During its CES 2025 presentation, Sony revealed that it's working on a live-action movie based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, with PlayStation exec Asad Qizilbash confirming that the project is in its "early stages".</p>

<p>Additionally, we're also getting a live-action movie based on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which will, of course, be created in conjunction with Sony Pictures. Let's hope this one doesn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">require you to create a PlayStation ID</a> before you can watch it.</p>

Will&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>be more or less subtle than its obvious inspiration&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>It's not just those two that are getting adaptations, either. Sony has also revealed that an <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2025/1/7/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-anime-series-2027-crunchyroll" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anime adaptation</a> of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>is in production, with a tentative release window of 2027.</p>

<p>The anime is being developed in conjunction with Sony subsidiaries Aniplex and Crunchyroll, and it'll be directed by Takanobu Mizuno, perhaps best known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Visions&nbsp;</em>short film "The Duel".</p>

<p>More specifically, the project will apparently adapt the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima: Legends&nbsp;</em>multiplayer experience. It's not entirely clear how Sony and Crunchyroll are planning to go about doing this, though.</p>

<p>Things aren't standing still in the worlds of the games these projects are based on, either. <i>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</i>developer Sucker Punch recently announced a followup <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>studio Naughty Dog <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">unveiled its next game</a> during last year's Game Awards, too.</p>

It’s priced at $79.99 and will be available on January 30th, with preorders starting on January 7th.</p><p>The Handheld Dock Chroma is a similar concept to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23409757/valve-steam-deck-dock-docking-station-tv-gaming-nintendo-switch">official docking stations provided by Valve</a> or Nintendo, allowing users to hook handheld devices up to external displays with expanded connections to complement big-screen gaming setups. The Handheld Dock Chroma uses a USB-C cable to connect supported devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPads and iPhones with USB-C ports, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch</a>, and Razer’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/15/23392481/razer-edge-android-cloud-gaming-tablet-qualcomm-price-release-date-specs">Edge Android gaming handheld</a>. </p><div><div><figcaption><em>Here are the port options in the rear, plus the USB-C cable to connect to your device.

The feature also makes use of the Kishi Ultra’s Sensa HD support, which converts audio output into haptic feedback on supported Android devices (but sadly isn’t available for iOS). PC Remote Play allows games to be streamed at full resolution without compromising “visual quality or game speed,” according to Razer, and can be accessed via the Razer Nexus app on iOS or Android.</p><div><figcaption><em>Razer’s new PC Remote Play feature provides PC-to-Phone streaming capabilities similar to the Steam Link mobile app.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

Project Arielle is a mesh gaming chair that features a bladeless fan system that’s designed to keep you at a comfortable temperature regardless of what environment you’re in. </p><p>We briefly tried it here at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news/archives/2">CES 2025</a> and it’s cool! Or warm, depending on the mode you set it to. When my colleague Sean Hollister tried it, he found it didn’t just warm or cool his butt, but gently and quietly blew a substantial amount of climate-controlled air onto his upper back from small holes along the chair’s top edge.</p><div><figcaption><em>A more comfortable way to freeze your butt off.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Building on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883174/razer-fujin-pro-gaming-chair-herman-miller-aeron">$1,049 Razer Fujin Pro mesh gaming chair</a> that you <em>can</em> currently buy, Project Arielle has three adjustable fan speeds that can reduce the perceived temperature by 2 to 5 degrees Celsius (around 3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) in “dry environments,” according to Razer. That sounds pretty useful if you live in a hot climate or if your gaming PC kicks out enough heat to turn your room into a sweatbox. </p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a rendering that shows how the hot or cool air is dispersed from the chair.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div><p>For chillier environments, the chair has a built-in PTC heating system (the same kind found in most vehicles and heated car seats) that can spit out warm air at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). The fans and that temperatures are adjusted using touch panel controls located next to the seat pad. And given this is a Razer product, there’s obviously RGB lighting throughout the chair. By default, it’s set to Razer’s trademark green when it’s off, and we saw the edge glow red when warm, blue when cool, and purple or orange when cooling or warming. </p><div><figcaption><em>Icons on the touch-controlled panel and the built-in RGB lighting indicate whether the chair is set to blast warm or cold air.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One downside: you can’t spin 360 degrees in this chair without wrapping a cord around yourself, as it does need to be plugged in. But even the prototype already has a cable that’ll safely disconnect if you accidentally give it a yank.</p><div><figcaption><em>The breakaway cable will disconnect if it’s pulled, kinda like the early Xbox controllers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Given Project Arielle is only a concept chair, this unfortunately isn’t something you can actually buy just yet. Razer has showcased a lot of quirky gaming gadget concepts at CES over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">chair cushions that shake your ass</a> with haptic feedback. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a>, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a>, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delivered by snakeskin-jacketed CEO Jensen Huang – interesting optics there – the CES keynote also detailed DLSS 4, an upgraded version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a> and its anti-aliasing/frame generation combo, as well as the input lag-quelling Nvidia Reflex 2. Let’s stick with the new GPUs for a moment, though, not least because I worry that I actually quite fancy the sound of the RTX 5070 and am convinced I’m being mindgamed into it.</p>

<p>Here’s the key specs and the pricing, which with the exception of the RTX 5090, actually stoops lower than each model’s RTX 40 series equivalent. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review">RTX 4080</a>, for instance, launched at £1269 / $1199, while the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review">RTX 4070</a> started from £589 / $599. Only the RTX 5090 and RTX 5070 Ti get VRAM capacity upgrades, though all four are switching to the newer, faster GDDR7.</p>

<p>Given that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">RTX 4090</a> currently struggles with precisely nothing, even the enforced ray tracing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> at 4K, it’s hard to see the RTX 5090 as anything other than a two-grand solution to a problem that never existed. The rest, though? Could be worse, could be worse. It took the RTX 40 series half a generation to fix its affordability mistakes with a new batch of RTX Supers, and these new GPUs are either cheaper or no more expensive. They're all a damn sight less than the RTX 5090, at any rate. Ah, there, see, they did it again.</p><p>Much like how the RTX 40 series got you exclusive usage of DLSS 3, the RTX 50 series also enables DLSS 4, which adds a 'Multi-Frame Generation' feature that can essentially create up to three AI frames for every rendered one. As opposed to DLSS 3, which can just generate up to one extra frame per regular frame. It’s already set for support in 75 games, a decent majority of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">those that currently work with DLSS 3</a>, and its proposed benefits come down to simple maths: more generated frames equals higher framerates, and in turn, better visual smoothness.</p>

<p>This could be a nice touch, though DLSS 4 comes with its own causes for concern. For one, it kind of throws most of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5070-family/">Nvidia’s own benchmark results</a> out of whack, with most graphs putting a thumb on the scales by comparing the fully revved-up, DLSS 4 versions of games against older DLSS versions. For what it’s worth, they do include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a> results that don’t use any upscaling at all, and the RTX 50 GPUs look to average about 20-25% than their predecessors there. With DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation, it’s more like 100%, including in the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-mode-your-gpu-probably-cant-run">path tracing</a>.</p>
<p>Input lag is another worry, as while DLSS 4 does pour more frames down your eyes, it’ll also mean waiting for those additional AI-generated frames to get out the way before you’ll see another, rendered frame that actually reflects your inputs. Nvidia say this will be addressed, however, by Reflex 2. On top of using the same latency reduction techniques as previous Reflex versions (mainly by having your CPU and GPU work in closer synchronisation), Reflex 2 adds a tool called Frame Warp.</p><p>It works like this: while your graphics card is rendering a frame, the CPU analyses your mouse input to work out where the camera position is going to move to. Reflex 2 then takes the data from the rendered frame and 'warps' the image to use this new, more rapidly calculated camera position, using predictive rendering the fill up any gaps that the additional movement might create. The result should be that what you see on your monitor will better reflect your most recent inputs, potentially cutting input lag by another 50% over standard Reflex.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/reflex-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reflex 2 will launch alongside the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 when they release on January 30th, though future updates will add support for older RTX graphics cards. Hopefully more games as well, as only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> and Valorant currently have Reflex 2 'coming soon.'.</p>
<p>I might be the victim of some big dual-fanned psyop, vis a vis the new GPUs, but on balance Reflex 2 is probably my favourite thing to come out of Nvidia’s reveal-athon. It just seems like a good example of using creative rendering techniques and predictive tech to make games feel and function better; I quite like frame generation as a concept and DLSS 4 probably be good for making numbers go up, but a game will still feel like wading through warm tar if only 20 of those hundred-odd frames per second are really being rendered by your PC.</p>
<p>Still, there are worse things to do with generative AI. Like, uh, PUBG Ally, the creepily subservient "Co-Playable Character" built with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-spoke-to-an-nvidia-ai-npc-and-he-mainly-wanted-to-get-me-bladdered">Nvidia ACE</a> NPC toolkit that lets you bring the Dead Internet theory directly into your battle royales.</p>

            <p>
Sony has unveiled its latest accessories to get the Midnight Black treatment: the DualSense Edge wireless controller, Pulse Elite wireless headset and the Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, as well as the PlayStation Portal.
</p>
<p>
The new range joins the existing Midnight Black colour options for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5s-dualsense-controller-gets-black-and-red-versions">regular DualSense</a> (released back in May 2021) and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-unveils-new-midnight-black-colour-option-for-its-pulse-3d-wireless-headset">Pulse 3D wireless headset</a> (released in September 2021), as well as the PS5's black console covers.
</p>
<p>
Sony adding more to its Midnight Black collection had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-dualsense-edge-and-pulse-headphones-reportedly-getting-black-colour-version">previously</a> been reported. As you'd expect, the range is coloured, well, black. Here's a video showing how it all looks:

<p>
"Each Midnight Black accessory features a unique, rich shade of black, with sleek detailing on various buttons and accents such as the PlayStation logo," Sony says, attempting to spin the fact these are coloured black into a full paragraph, which I myself am also now guilty of.
</p><p>
The charging case for the Pulse Explore earbuds is black, the charging hanger for the Pulse Elite headset is black, and the carrying case for the DualSense Edge controller is also black. However, the carrying case for the Pulse Elite wireless headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds will be... felt grey.
</p>
<p>The range will go on sale via direct.playstation.com and participating from 20th February, with pre-orders open on 16th January if you're feeling super keen. Pricing is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation Portal remote player – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99 </li>
<li>Pulse Explore wireless earbuds – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99</li>
<li>Pulse Elite wireless headset – Midnight Black: $149.99 | €149.99 | £129.99 GBP</li>
<li>DualSense Edge wireless controller – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets-revealed-black-ops-cold-war-cost-700m.1075950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A court document filed by&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>publisher Activision has revealed just how astronomically huge the budgets for the first-person shooter franchise can get, with even games from a few years ago reaching hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Game File, Stephen Totilo points to a court filing in which Activision's Patrick Kelly outlines budget figures for three&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games, namely&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 3</em>, 2019's&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>reboot, and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War</em>.</p>

<p>According to those numbers,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 3&nbsp;</em>cost Activision more than $450 million to make across its lifespan, while&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>cost $640 million and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>set the company back a staggering $700 million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-modern-warfare.jpg?itok=PtzHJ9fM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-modern-warfare.jpg?itok=g-yjSCa- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>'s budget broke the $600 million mark, and it's not even Activision's most expensive&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth bearing in mind that Kelly's figures refer to the development costs for these games' entire life cycles, not just the initial cost to make them.&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>is, after all, a live-service franchise, and money must be spent to create content after the games are initially released.</p>

<p>Every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game also sells tens of millions of copies, so it's very likely Activision is recouping its development budget and then some for each game.</p>

<p>In fact, Kelly points to sales figures for each of the games listed;&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 3&nbsp;</em>sold 43 million copies,&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>shifted 41 million, and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>managed to sell 30 million units over its lifetime.</p>

<p>Obviously, Kelly's numbers don't include the most recent&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, but we do know that it apparently&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch yet</a>, so let's just say it's unlikely the budget is lower than&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War</em>'s was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-black-ops-6.jpg?itok=ckIxWp3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-black-ops-6.jpg?itok=YJzdA8-8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s budget is likely to be even higher than its predecessors'.</figcaption></figure><p>Most major publishers and developers don't publicly reveal their budgets to this degree, so we don't have a lot of points of comparison. However, Totilo points to what he calls a "poorly redacted court filing" from 2023, which puts&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>'s development cost at about $220 million.</p>

<p>Now, obviously,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2&nbsp;</em>isn't a live-service game, so its budget will naturally be smaller. Still, this just goes to show the insane amounts of money&nbsp;Activision is spending on each&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game, especially compared to other industry tentpole releases.</p>

            <p>Countless are the pretenders to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>'s skull-buttressed throne, but I sense a certain fearful promise in The Deadly Path, a building management and roguelike strategy game from Owlskip Enterprises. The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The main thing I dislike about the trailer is the tone, which is on the quippy side. This is more a question of taste, mind. I prefer my cosmic horror devoid of whimsy, please and thank you. Yog-Sothoth isn't some kind of menacing party clown for you to throw punchlines at. Mortals are supposed to recoil from such entities weeping and wailing as their minds empty of sanity like punctured fire extinguishers, not cock an eyebrow at the camera and say something like "you don't have to be mad to work here, but it helps!!!!"</p>
<p>A touch of gallows humour can be useful, here and there, but it has to be properly deathly. That man in the trailer sounds like he's having <em>fun</em> being the servant of incomprehensible dark forces. It's atrocious!</p>
<p>Beyond that, I like the cut of these gibbering undead stooges. As you can see from the footage, much hinges on adroit navigation of multiple, competing timers. The end goal in each game appears to be fashioning an idol of some kind, so that your chosen Dread Deity may Ascend.</p><p>The card art is nicely dense with detail, and the lore text is as overripe as you'd expect from a work of Lovecraftage. Consider The Vein of Jealousy, one of the game's festering divinities - "a gargantuan five-headed mass of thrombosed veins that spouts liquid envy as it sees fit, spreading a trail of infectious resentment and bitterness in its wake". Aside from building up a network of minion production and housing facilities, you can advance between ages to "uncover new gods, loot, portals and possibilities."</p>
<p>You might know Owlskip - founded by Tim Sheinman - as the developer behind political satire <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/conspiracy">Conspiracy!</a> and investigative music history game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/family-is-like-a-free-version-of-obra-dinn-but-for-fake-80s-music">Family</a>, which Alice B (RPS in peace) described as "a lovely little gem to spend an afternoon with." Shienman is a dab hand for games in which you sift through and join up documents and memorabilia to various effect. I can see how his skillset would translate naturally to an eldritch strategy experience of this nature.</p>

            <p>Former Bethesda designer Will Shen, who worked on several high profile titles such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Skyrim, has said he believes players are becoming "fatigued" with games that take hours upon hours upon hours to complete.</p>
<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCYpt9Zg7cM">Kiwi Talkz</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-veteran-says-players-are-fatigued-by-seemingly-endless-games/1100-6528653/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>), Shen was asked about game length and acknowledged that there are still plenty of people putting hours into Skyrim. But, do players want to invest the same amount of time into newer games coming to the market? Well, Shen feels we're kind of over that idea when it comes to new releases.</p>

<p>"We're reaching a point where people are fatigued, or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game," explained Shen. "Because they already have that. They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It's always a tall order."</p><p>Shen said we are now seeing a "resurgence" of shorter games that are more easily digestible (at least in terms of playtime). He pointed to Mouthwashing - a game our Katharine called a "brilliantly refreshing and unflinching horror" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mouthwashing-review">Eurogamer's four star review</a> - as an example of how shorter games can still deliver a winning result.</p>
<p>"[Mouthwashing is] only three hours long at most, it's a very short experience," Shen said, "but part of the benefit of that is the community engagement around the story of Mouthwashing is only possible because everyone who is a fan has actually played through it all the way to the end."</p>
<p>Shen said he understood there were other factors that had contributed to Mouthwashing's success, but that he firmly believed the game's short length was one of the key reasons it was such a hit. "You can have a fan community conversation around a game that's much shorter because the shortness allows everyone to engage fully with the entirety of the product," Shen continued, adding games that go over the 10 hour mark are often left uncompleted by many players.</p>
<p>"I would say 75 percent of your players only play through the first five to 10 hours, so that's a huge fragmenting of your overall fan community base."</p>

</figure>
<p>What are your thoughts on game length? Do you think shorter is sweeter, or are you still on the lookout for that one game that will become The Game you play?</p>
<p>As a quick aside, our Jim was also rather taken with Mouthwashing, so taken in fact he named it one of his games of 2024 in the Eurogamer video team's roundup, which you can watch above.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-lead-quest-designer-joins-other-ex-bethesda-developers-at-wyrdsong-studio">Shen is no longer with Bethesda</a> and working on Starfield, the studio itself still is. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Todd Howard confirmed at least one more DLC for the space epic</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">2024's Shattered Space expansion</a>. As for what that could be, fans believe a trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax back in July <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-points-to-future-starfield-expansion-fans-believe">could point to Starfield's second expansion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PUBG maker Krafton has unveiled what it's calling Co-Playable Characters (CPCs) - essentially, AI companions that are designed to move, shoot and talk like a human teammate.
</p>
<p>
The technology is powered by an on-device small language model (SLM) and Nvidia ACE technology, which uses generative AI to chat and react to your voice commands. 
</p>
<p>
In essence, it's a smart AI partner with the functionality of a chatbot built in. 
</p>
<p>
Nvidia <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint/">says</a> its ACE technology allows for "companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics".
</p>
<p>
It's powered by a language model that's "capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making", Nvidia continues, as well as "multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment".

<p>
How will this work in PUBG? As seen in the video above from Krafton, players will be able to team up with a "PUBG Ally" who responds to your commands - such as finding a specific armour item, or running to your side. 
</p>
<p>
There's even the suggestion your PUBG Ally will undertake in a bit of banter. "I carry for a living," the robotic voice says. Bit creepy.
</p>
<p>
As yet there's no word on when PUBG Ally will go live in-game, but further CPCs are also on the way. 
</p>
<p>Krafton's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">upcoming Sims-like life simulation game inZoi</a> will also use the technology, with Co-Playable Characters named "Smart Zoi" that will essentially act as human-like NPCs within the experience, designed to support your own character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A pre-development video for the new Virtua Fighter project in the works by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio was shared during CES 2025, providing a quick look at the sort of visuals the game should be expected to push.</p>
<p>The video, which was shown during <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote</a>, is essentially a proof-of-concept video showcasing two versions of the series' protagonist, Akira, duking it out in a highly detailed town environment with an Asian flair. Still, it is undeniable that the direction the celebrated fighting game series by SEGA is taking is looking quite promising in the visuals and animation department.</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Virtua Fighter project was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">last month</a> during The Game Awards show, along with another project called Project Century, which looks more in line with the Like a Dragon series. Sadly, very little is currently known about these projects, and it may be a while before we hear more about them, considering they both lack official names.</p>
<p>Despite the new Virtua Fighter project likely being far from release, fans of the series still have something to look forward to. Later this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-brings-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-to-steam-this-winter/">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O</a> is launching on PC, taking the gameplay of the fifth entry in the series, which is also available on PlayStation 5 as Ultimate Showdown, and bringing it to new heights with rollback netcode support, 4K visuals and additional content.</p>

            <p>The development of 2020 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </a>cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a> (paywalled) in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-duty-classic">Call Of Duty</a> creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.</p><!--more-->
<p>These are 2015’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii">Black Ops 3</a> (“over $450 million”), 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Modern Warfare</a> (“over $640 million”), and the aforementioned Cold War. The filing also contained sales figures: Black Ops 3 has sold 43 million copies, Modern Warfare 41 million, and Cold War 30 million. These are specified by Kelly to be "development costs", so presumably don't include marketing, though there's no full breakdown.</p>
<p>There have been higher external estimates for ongoing development of a video game, notably <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/its-taken-4-years-and-roughly-dollar900-million-but-genshin-impact-is-a-better-open-world-rpg-than-ever-after-update-50/">Genshin Impact</a>, but this is by far the highest figure from an internal source. For comparison, Totilo points to court documents from 2023 which revealed $212 and $220 million budgets for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon: Forbidden West</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last Of Us Part 2</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The information, says Game File, is based on a declaration from Kelly filed to a court in California on 23rd December, and is part of Activision’s response to a lawsuit filed against the company last May regarding a 2022 school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The lawsuit against Activision also blames Facebook owner Meta, alleging that the two companies <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8449dxw23do">“knowingly exposed”</a> the shooter to the weapon he used.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ps5-xbox-series-switch-slump?open=false#%C2%A7item-uvalde-families-sue-activision-saying-call-of-duty-inspired-killer">reported by</a> Game File, Activision last year denied any connection between games and gun violence, while also expressing sympathy for the victims. In October of 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-gun-giant-remington-used-call-of-duty-to-promote-weapons-to-younger-players">previously undisclosed product placement</a> deal between Call Of Duty and rifle manufacturer Remington.</p>
<p>To return to the figures themselves: they’re absurd, yes. It's a shame we don't have a proper breakdown of the costs by development discipline. Is most of the money going toward tuning up the art and graphics? If so, it's worth noting that players nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-66-titles-saw-80-percent-of-all-playtime-in-2023-most-older-games-like-fortnite-or-gta-5">increasingly seem to favour reliable older titles with outdated visuals</a> over expensive spectacle. In any case, budgets this big have worrying implications for individual developers within the Microsoft/Activision empire, who are more likely to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">face layoffs</a> when costs increase and fail to be recouped.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
