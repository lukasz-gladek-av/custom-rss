Nearly every ability in the Martian medic’s kit has been balanced in some way. Her primary fire has been reduced to 28 shots per second from its original 34, her lock-on torpedoes that damage enemies and heal teammates have become more powerful, and her speed-boosting Hyper Ring ability has an increased deploy range alongside a shorter cooldown. So while her healing and damage output has been lowered, her abilities have been made more efficient. Those are the kinds of minimal changes you’d expect as Blizzard is still figuring out a new hero, so we’ll see if farther-reaching changes are on the horizon. The team also included several quality-of-life adjustments to how Juno’s abilities are communicated, which you can read about in the patch notes below.</p><figure id="" data-id="0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-recommend-id="image://0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Juno stands in Midtown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Juno stands in Midtown." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-recommend-id="image://0eb76ad65e2cdad6ca8914687bb8c464" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Juno stands in Midtown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lifeweaver, who Blizzard has had trouble balancing since he launched last year, is getting some pretty notable quality-of-life improvements that will make his kit less punishing to those using the support hero. His primary Healing Blossom that heals teammates now passively charges, allowing you to fire a fully-charged flower across the battlefield instantly. This passive charge is slower than the manual one you can do by holding down the RT/R2/Left click, but it stays charged when you swap between Healing Blossom and his offensive secondary fire. This way you’re not punished for swapping between modes of fire, allowing you to switch to an offensive attack and quickly return to healing if need be. The Petal Platform, which elevates any hero (friend or foe) who stands on it, also got a much-needed update. Now, if someone steps off the platform, rather than remaining in the air and becoming functionally useless, it will return to the ground to lift a player to high ground once more. There have been plenty of times I’ve thrown a platform down as Lifeweaver just for someone to fall off of it almost immediately, so this is a welcome change.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-recommend-id="image://2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lifeweaver tosses a Healing Blossom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lifeweaver tosses a Healing Blossom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-recommend-id="image://2f43baafa42ffe13c2815d11179d2837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lifeweaver tosses a Healing Blossom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One balance change that affects multiple heroes is a health nerf that cuts a lot of squishy characters’ health down to 225. <em>Overwatch 2</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">increased most characters’ health</a></span> in February after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-self-healing-passive-tank-damage-1851163814&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-self-healing-passive-tank-damage-1851163814">adding passive health regeneration</a></span> in season 9. Blizzard is tweaking health pools for mobile heroes that can get away from a scrap, so the hope here is that this will make it easier to take out the heroes who often harass a backline and get away just before a killing shot. Heroes affected by this nerf include flight-based characters Echo, Juno, and Mercy (Pharah is notably absent), as well as those who can escape a fight easily like Lucio, Sombra, Kiriko, and Moira. Hanzo, meanwhile, has also had his health nerfed, which Blizzard says is to balance the fact that he can one-shot a lot of these heroes now that they have 225 HP.<br></p><p>Beyond hero changes, Season 12 also adds the new mode Clash, which is a King of the Hill-style mode that feels like a reason for Blizzard to bring back old maps without revisiting the maligned two-point capture mode that was phased out in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Both the Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis maps are based on fan-favorite maps from the original <em>Overwatch</em> Hanamura and Temple of Anubis, respectively. We’ll see how the community reacts to the mode in the coming weeks.</p><p>The full patch notes are as follows:</p><h4 id="h16661"><a id=""></a><strong><em>GENERAL UPDATES</em></strong></h4><p><strong><em>Avoid As Teammate</em></strong></p><p><em>The Avoid List has been updated with the following new features:</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Players now have 15 avoid slots divided into 3 Pinned slots and 12 Recent slots.</em></li><li><em>Pinned Avoid slots guarantee that these players will never be in your matches and unlike our old Avoid slots, they never time out.</em></li><li><em>The new Recent Avoid slots do time out after 7 days like the old Avoid slots, and they only prioritize constructing teams without these players on them.</em></li><li><em>The player with the lowest time remaining in the Recent list is removed from the list if a new player is avoided when the list is full.</em></li><li><em>Time Remaining for an avoided player in the Recent list can be refreshed by using the Reset Avoid Expiration feature.</em></li><li><em>The Avoid List is now its own tab in the Social menu (which still only appears when at least 1 player is avoided).</em></li><li><em>Any players that were avoided when Season 11 ended will be removed from the avoided list due to the aforementioned updates to the system.</em></li></ul><p><em>Developer Comments: Avoiding other players has been a great way to curate your experience since the system was added, but with these changes we wanted to explore giving players best ways to manage their avoid slots.</em></p><p><strong><em>Spawn System Changes</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Group Respawn is replaced by Wave Respawn for all non-Competitive modes.</em></li><li><em>Wave Respawn is added to Competitive Play.</em></li><li><em>Default respawn time increased from 10 to 12 seconds.</em></li><li><em>Overtime respawn time increased from 13 to 14 seconds.</em></li><li><em>Wave Respawn is disabled in Overtime.</em></li><li><em>Overtime respawn time is not increased in Flashpoint.</em></li><li><em>Wave Respawn is disabled when the Payload is near the end of the track in Escort and Hybrid game modes (the same time the existing Anti-Stall system activates).</em></li><li><em>When the first hero on a team dies, they start a new Wave for their team.</em></li><li><em>Any hero that dies within 6 seconds of a Wave starting automatically joins that Wave.</em></li><li><em>A hero joining a Wave will respawn at the exact same time as the hero that started the Wave. This means that the respawn time of heroes joining the wave can be as long as 12 seconds if they died at the same time as the first hero or as short as 6 seconds if they catch the end of the Wave.</em></li><li><em>If a hero starts a Wave and no other hero joins the Wave they will respawn 2 seconds faster. This hero will respawn in 10 seconds (the default respawn time before Season 12).</em></li></ul><p><em>Developer Comments: These changes are designed to reduce the number of one-sided matches. For an in-depth analysis of our thought process behind the changes to respawning, read the latest Director’s Take on PlayOverwatch.com.</em></p><p><strong><em>Shop Updates</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>You can now try out all skins in the practice range from the Hero Gallery or the Premium Shop.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16662"><a id=""></a><strong><em>COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES</em></strong></h4><p><strong><em>Mid-Year Rank Reset</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Competitive skill ranks for all players have been reset for Season 12.</em></li><li><em>Players will need to complete ten placement matches for each role to be ranked and start climbing on the leaderboard.</em></li></ul><p><em>Developer Comments: Our plan is to reset ranks every 6 months alongside larger updates that shake up the metagame including significant hero balance changes, new heroes like Juno, new game modes like Clash, and changes to core systems like the respawning changes mentioned above.</em></p><p><strong><em>Predicted Rank</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>The Predicted Rank that was displayed to players in Placements at the end of each match is now displayed in all locations that rank is displayed for individual players.</em></li><li><em>Predicted Rank is only displayed to players viewing their own Rank (other players can’t see this information).</em></li><li><em>Predicted Rank is now used to determine whether a group is Wide or Narrow, meaning that Placements are no longer automatically considered Wide.</em></li><li><em>This will allow players to get much faster queues in many scenarios after their Rank has been reset.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16663"><a id=""></a><strong><em>HERO UPDATES</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comments: Our recent 2.11.1 patch (which adjusted all the Tank heroes), saw a significant gain in interest for the role and had a positive lasting effect in queue times for Damage and Support as well. There are a few additional tuning changes in this update for Tanks but this patch is largely focused on adjusting many of the more mobile heroes in the Damage and Support roles.</em></p><p><em>Mobility is very powerful and we would like for there to be more of a tradeoff for the flexibility that it brings, especially as we add speed boosting abilities by welcoming Juno to the game. We’re moving a handful of heroes to a 225 HP maximum and in some cases increasing potency elsewhere in their kit.</em></p><h4 id="h16664"><a id=""></a><strong><em>TANK</em></strong></h4><h4 id="h16665"><a id=""></a><strong><em>D.VA</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: The increase in Defense Matrix availability didn’t help D.Va’s overall performance that much compared to the amount of frustration it is causing players on the opposing team, so we’re reverting it to the previous duration.</em></p><p><strong><em>Defense Matrix</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Maximum duration reduced from 3.5 to 3 seconds.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16666"><a id=""></a><strong><em>ORISA</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: Orisa is still underperforming so we’re increasing the impact damage of Energy Javelin to better reward accuracy with the ability.</em></p><p><strong><em>Energy Javelin</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Impact damage increased from 60 to 80.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16667"><a id=""></a><strong><em>ZARYA</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: Zarya’s secondary fire didn’t benefit much from the projectile size changes in Season 9 since it’s mostly aimed at the ground.

It’s also nice for the Hanzo mirror match to be more decisive as well.</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16671"><a id=""></a><strong><em>JUNKRAT</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: This is mostly a reversion back to how Junkrat’s grenades used to ricochet in early Overwatch, which enables more control over the angle of the bounce and helps the weapon better control spaces with some tricky shots, but the projectile size is now reduced after a couple of bounces so there will be fewer random feeling direct impacts near the end of the projectiles lifetime.</em></p><p><strong><em>Frag Launcher</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Projectile size is now reduced by half after the second ricochet.</em></li><li><em>Projectiles preserve slightly more velocity on ricochet.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16672"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SOJOURN</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: After reducing the maximum damage of the Railgun’s secondary fire, we’re continuing to look at the effectiveness of Sojourn’s primary fire. These changes are to make it more accurate and better reward accuracy by increasing the energy gained from headshots.</em></p><p><strong><em>Railgun</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Primary fire weapon spread reduced from 2 to 1.6 degrees.</em></li><li><em>Critical hits now grant 10 energy.</em></li><li><em>Energy degeneration rate reduced from 33 to 15 per second after 7 seconds.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16673"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SOMBRA</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: The increased movement speed while in stealth will better enable Sombra to get into advantageous positions or be slightly more evasive with the new lower health.</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Virus</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Impact damage increased from 25 to 35.</em></li></ul><p><strong><em>Stealth</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Bonus movement speed increased from 45 to 60%.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16674"><a id=""></a><strong><em>TORBJÖRN</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: This shift in armor health for Torbjorn is to increase survivability against the heroes which are most affected by armor’s damage reduction, such as Tracer.</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Base health reduced from 250 to 225.</em></li><li><em>Base armor increased from 50 to 75.</em></li></ul><h4 id="h16675"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SUPPORT</em></strong></h4><h4 id="h16676"><a id=""></a><strong><em>ILLARI</em></strong></h4><p><em>Developer Comment: Illari can deal a lot of damage over the course of a game but may have too much ammo, given that her projectiles are easier to land hits due to their increased projectile size.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ArenaNet has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-expansion-is-out-august-20-adds-new-raid-player-housing-and-land-spears/">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds</a>, marking the <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth expansion</a> for the renowned MMORPG title, originally released back in 2012.</p>
<p>The hype surrounding Janthir Wilds in the industry is at its all-time peak, given that initially, we saw ArenaNet disclosing to us about the actual expansion almost three months ago, and now the time has finally arrived when players will have the opportunity to experience the new in-game content that arrives alongside the expansion update. Janthir Wilds brings mechanisms to housing the game, allowing players to create their own "Homesteads." Along with this, the update features a new World Boss event and much more, which we'll discuss next.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Starting with Homestead, the game apparently grants players a patch of land where they can build their own housing space, with plenty of customization options. These include different props, objects, and decorations, which can be placed in the housing area through tools. It's an area where you can socialize with in-game comrades and is set to "provide a new way to express personal identity in the world of Tyria."</p>
<p>Apart from Homestead being the big thing, Janthir Wilds also brings in access to a new weapon type, particularly a spear. The Kodan Spear Mastery will teach players a bevy of new abilities in order to face the wild beasts of Janthir, ultimately taking the combat experience to new levels. Along with this, the new expansion brings in an enhanced Warclaw Mount, along with the dedicated World Boss Event, which is described as below:</p>
<p><em><strong>Warclaw Mount Update:&nbsp;</strong>previously occupying a niche for World-vs.-World competitive game modes, the newly updated warclaw mount provides additional opportunities for exploration in the open world via a new mastery track. Once fully trained, this large cat doesn’t take fall damage, can leap multiple times in the air, uses its sharp nose to sniff for treasure, and employs its chain pull skill in combat against enemies while also allowing its rider to throw lances from the saddle.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><em><strong>New World Boss Event:&nbsp;</strong>the primordial energies of Janthir have drawn massive entities known as titans to its rocky shores. This dual threat encounter will challenge upwards of 50 players to put all their new skills to use in the kind of massive, signature epic showdown that&nbsp;Guild Wars 2&nbsp;is known for.</em></p>
<p>Josh Davis, Guild Wars 2 Game Director, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Janthir Wilds is a promise fulfilled. When we announced we were moving to yearly expansion cycles, this is what we had in mind: new content every few months full of compelling content and new gameplay features so that the game always feels fresh when you log in</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will require users to pay a $25 fee to access the new content, but given the in-game additions we have seen, it's certainly worth it, especially for the franchise's fans.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-new-details-anti-cheat-esports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-new-details-on-anti-cheat-esports-and-updates.960003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-new-details-anti-cheat-esports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, we sat down with Ian Proulx, co-founder and CEO at 1047 Games, the developer behind Splitgate 2. Eager to find out more about this developing and intense shooter, we probed into the game’s development and the outlook on the title from a competitive perspective.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-first-and-foremost">First and Foremost</h2>



<p>Sitting down with Ian Proulx, we received key insights into the ongoing development of Splitgate 2, which is being tweaked at present following a recent playtest. One of our first and most important questions was about the integration of a solid anti-cheat system, which is paramount to success for an FPS title in this day and age.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has been our top priority – a couple of years ago, we acquired an anti-cheat company called EQU8. We decided to bring these guys in-house, partly to put more resources into our anti-cheat. You kind of have two options –  you can either make an anticheat that does a mediocre job of defending against all sorts of games, or you can make an anticheat that does a really good job of defending one game, and for us, we only care about one game. </p>



<p>As a third-party, that was their focus, they needed to make something that caters to lots of different clients, but now they’re in-house, they only have to cater for Splitgate 2.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bringing the anti-cheat solution in-house means that the team doesn’t need to rely on regularly cracked solutions like BattleEye and Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-competitive">Getting Competitive</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you’ve seen the gameplay of Splitgate 2, you’ll have noticed how much it seems to feel like an <strong>esports-ready </strong>game. It takes place in an arena, like a spectator sport, and it boasts a system that lends itself to players assuming roles and competing as a team.</p>



<p>However, talking to Ian Proulx about this, that isn’t too high on the team’s agenda:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our art style and our lore is that this is a sport and not a war. We’re not trying to say ‘this is esports’, we’re trying to say ‘this is the world of Splitgate 2’, it’s the sport of the future. If you look at the branding, it’s very inspired by Formula 1, NBA, NFL, and so on.</p>



<p>In terms of esports specifically, obviously we’ve made a game that we say is easy to learn but difficult to master, and I think we’ve hit that balance a lot better this time around. Do I think that this game would be a great esport? Absolutely. I’m not really having tonnes of conversations about that yet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Proulx did admit that if the game is ‘sticky’ and people enjoy it, then esports with naturally follow.</p>



<h2 id="h-building-something-memorable">Building Something Memorable</h2>

<p>Throughout the conversation with Ian Proulx, he remained on-point with the driving message that this is a shooter that is being developed with the community in mind. He used the term ‘community-first development’, talking about forming relationships with streamers and kicking off activations to generate hype, but it always comes back to supporting that community. </p>



<p>Talking about the most recent tweaks to the game, Proulx walked through adjustments and balancing measures to portals and how they work, some quality-of-life changes in button mapping, and some sizeable tweaks to the game, such as the creative decision to remove EMP grenades.</p>



<p>Movement has been ramped up, and Proulx is particularly proud of the game’s sliding mechanic, which is the result of months of painstaking work.</p>



<p>Ultimately, everything that we were shown about Splitgate 2 fills us with a sense of encouragement about the ongoing development of this title. It’s sure to be a hit, just as the first game was, but this time around, there’s more meat on the bones to keep it going post-launch. It’s a free-to-play shooter (with cosmetic MTX) and it has been built with the player in mind and nothing but passion from the developers.</p>



<p>What more could you ask for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-players-enticed-by-ultra-realistic-competitor-inzois-character-creator-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, The Sims competitor from PUBG developer Krafton, is drawing in a lot of new fans through its character creator demo, which shows off its ultra realistic graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-fans-are-creating-some-wonderful-and-horrific-beings-in-its-character-creator">Krafton has deployed the same strategy as the likes of Dragon's Dogma 2</a> and others by releasing the character creator portion of its game early. The Inzoi: Character Studio currently available on Steam will only be there for a few days, however, until August 25 at 9pm Pacific.</p><p>The full version of Inzoi is expected in late 2024 and is described as "a life simulation game where players become gods within the game, allowing them to change everything as they wish and experience endless new stories in various forms of life."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/ss-bed14625da4c181e3334411fe03d5b72680761a3-1920x1080-1724258287098.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>inZOI: Character Studio. Image credit: Krafton.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This already had fans of The Sims turning their heads, but the character creator demo seems to have pulled their attention altogether. The Sims 4 is almost a decade old itself, but beyond that has been criticized for only including basic features and charging users for myriad expansion packs.</p><p>"I'm not looking back," said slickkpanther on Reddit. "All I've ever wanted in a life-sim was to walk around in a nice city, look pretty, maybe grab a coffee, read a book and plant some flowers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"It sounds like a lot, but it's really not. I'm not asking for every building to be enterable. I'm not asking for hundreds of unique NPCs on screen. I'm not even asking for a realistic weather system. What I want only sounds like a lot, because the bar has been set so low by The Sims 4."</p><p>Myriad others agreed. "All life sim fans should feel the way you do," said one user in the comments. "Because, at a minimum, if Inzoi were to be successful, this would likely put pressure on EA to do better. Lack of competition has allowed EA to underdeliver with The Sims 4 and monetize the hell out of everything. It's easy for them to exploit fans, when the fans have no better options to turn to."</p><p>These comments come despite Inzoi being in its infancy, and Krafton certainly appears to have big plans for the game.</p><p>"Our goal with Inzoi is to create a world where creativity knows no bounds, and where every choice leads to new and unexpected experiences," said director and producer Hyungjun Kim. "We want players to enjoy not only the joy of crafting their ideal lives but also the thrill of navigating a dynamic, evolving world."</p><p>It's saying a lot of right things for life simulator fans too, including that mod support will be available on day one and Inzoi will be supported after launch too.</p><p>Many still have reservations, of course, seemingly because the genre hasn't had much care and attention in recent years, but even those with doubts appear quietly optimistic.</p><p>"I'm excited for this game but I have my worries," said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1ew3ymx/im_excited_for_this_game_but_i_have_my_worries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old-Cobbler402</a>. "First of all, I think that the game looks beautiful but some visual aspects regarding the Zois are worrying me. Some may be due to the game not being finished yet."</p><p>They pointed out a difference in visuals between the character creator and the live mode, which essentially emulates what actual gameplay will look like. Some other visual bugs exist too, but fans are hoping these get ironed out ahead of Inzoi's launch.</p><p>Only time will tell how this will look though. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-developer-creating-its-own-sims-in-unreal-engine-5">Krafton only announced Inzoi in November 2023</a> and the release of the character creator indicates development is progressing smoothly, but late 2024 is getting closer and closer so a release date announcement should be due soon.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/secret-level-every-video-game-in-the-new-gamescom-trailer.959991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One of the most intriguing projects featured at gamescom 2024 isn’t a game at all, but an animated series. Prime Video’s Secret Level is an anthology series by the creators of Love, Death + Robots. Each episode is basically a short film inspired by the characters and worlds of iconic video games like God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and Pac-Man.</p><p>The first trailer for the series gives us a brief glimpse of these gorgeously animated shorts and the often surprising ways in which they reinvent familiar gaming icons. But which games are featured in the series, and is that really Keanu Reeves piloting a mecha suit? Let’s break down exactly what we see in the trailer.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Secret Level gamescom ONL 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Armored Core</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/gvct3zywyaaj9v0-1724242311279.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise in the Secret Level trailer is the reveal that Keanu Reeves himself is apparently involved. Reeves (or someone who looks an awful lot like the John Wick star) can be seen in footage for the Armored Core episode. Reeves’ character is shown entering an Armored Core mecha and suiting up for battle. Between this and his prominent role in Cyberpunk 2077, Reeves’ gaming pedigree is very strong these days.  </p><h2>Concord</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-56-screenshot-1724255820210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Concord is only just now making its way to the PC and PS5, but it’s already getting an animated spinoff thanks to Secret Level. We can see a shot of the steep, vertically-oriented city that was previously seen in the Concord cinematic trailer.</p><h2>Crossfire</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-48-screenshot-1724255835489.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The tactical shooter series Crossfire is one of the games featured in Secret Level, which is interesting, considering that these games aren’t normally known for their intricate stories. We see several quick shots of SWAT team characters in action, promising a tense and gritty addition to the series’ lineup. </p><h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-42-screenshot-1724255855714.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons fans were already treated to an entertaining live-action adaptation in 2023, and now they’ll get to enjoy a lavish CG-animated D&amp;D short thanks to Secret Level. We briefly see a massive dragon emerging from the shadows, as well as a shot of a sword-shaped bridge over a waterfall that leads to a fortress. Based on these shots, it looks like Secret Level is opting for a more traditional and serious take on the franchise than the 2023 film. </p><h2>EXODUS</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-40-screenshot-1724255869732.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The upcoming science fiction game EXODUS looks to be a natural fit for Secret Level, as it deals with the emotional fallout of time dilation and the way that time can pass in the blink of an eye for the human heroes fighting against the Celestials. We see that emotion on full display in a scene involving two aged characters tenderly reunited in the trailer. </p><h2>Honor of Kings</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-26-screenshot-1724255889023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We never would have predicted that a MOBA game like Honor of Kings would be one of the ones featured in Secret Level, but that doesn’t mean we’re not interested to see how the series reinterprets this popular title. Based on the handful of quick shots seen in the trailer, it looks like Secret Level is opting for a relatively more realistic and detailed approach compared to the anime aesthetic of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Mega Man</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-47-screenshot-1724255902717.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Capcom’s long-running Mega Man series is represented in Secret Level, though this isn’t quite the Mega Man fans know from the classic 8-bit games. The series is clearly taking a much more realistic approach to the character. Well, as realistic as a story about a cyborg boy with a giant cannon for a hand can be, anyway. We see the character suiting up to take on Dr. Wily’s Robot Masters. </p><h2>New World: Aeternum</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-21-screenshot-1724255922651.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It should probably come as no surprise that Amazon’s own MMORPG New World would be among the games featured in this series. Like in the game, this short appears to be set on the fabled island of Aeternum, as a lone hero prepares to prove his mettle and make his fortune. The quick glimpse seen in the trailer suggests this will be one of the more detailed and realistically rendered episodes of the series.</p><h2>The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-17-screenshot-1724255939548.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Secret Level will be exploring the world of Halcyon from Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds series. This short looks to have one of the most visually distinctive styles of the series, as it blends live-action characters with CG-rendered environments. As you’d expect, the striking color palette of the games is on full display here.</p><h2>Pac-Man</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-23-screenshot-1724255958549.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There’s maybe no better example of how dramatically Secret Level will reinvent some iconic gaming properties than Pac-Man. You could be forgiven for not even realizing Pac-Man is included in the trailer. Far removed from the simplistic source material, the trailer shows us a hooded, seemingly alien figure making their way through a vast wasteland. The trailer also ends with a quick glimpse of a robotic Pac-Man with razor-sharp teeth coming online. We have to wonder if Pac-Man is the villain in this peculiar but intriguing take on the franchise.</p><h2>PlayStation Studios: God of War &amp; Ghost of Tsushima</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-49-screenshot-1724255975748.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It appears that we’re getting an episode framed around the Playstation Studios lineup, as we see both God of War’s Kratos and Ghost of Tsushima’s Jin Sakai in the trailer.</p><p>The Kratos shot confirms that the series is taking its cues from the more recent God of War games, where Kratos is an axe-wielding slayer of Norse gods, rather than the original, Greek mythology-focused games. We have to assume that means his son Atreus will be tagging along for the ride. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-jin-sakai-1724255464041.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What’s really surprising, though, is that Kratos appears to be walking through a modern city. Is this short going to be dealing with time travel? What happens when you turn cold-blooded killers like Kratos and Jin-Sakai loose in the 21st Century? And just how many PlayStation Studios characters are appearing in this episode? We can’t wait to find out.</p><h2>Sifu</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-1-11-screenshot-1724255994551.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Sloclap’s popular 2022 beat-em-up Sifu is featured in the trailer. We see a blood-soaked character entering a dojo and gearing up for another bloody fight. Later, we see a couple of quick shots of a violent brawl in a neon-drenched nightclub. It appears that Secret Level is opting for a slightly more realistic animation style compared to the relatively stylized, angular style of the game. We’re interested to see just how, if at all, the short tackles the resurrection-based combat of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Spelunky</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-50-screenshot-1724256018752.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The trailer includes a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it shot of a Spelunky-themed episode. We briefly glimpse treasure hunter Ana Spelunky stumbling inside a lava-filled cavern. It’s quite a treat seeing the quirky indie series being given such an ambitious visual makeover.</p><h2>Unreal Tournament</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-48-screenshot-1-1724256032749.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Also very briefly seen in the trailer is a quick shot from an Unreal Tournament episode. We can see an arena brandished with the logo for Riordan Dynamics, the company at the heart of the storyline in the Unreal Tournament games. The arena is clearly set up for a bloody deathmatch, with two opposing towers that remind us of an indoor version of the iconic Facing Worlds map. </p><h2>Warhammer 40,000</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-3-screenshot-1724256051064.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It remains to be seen if Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 series will ever see the light of day, but at least Secret Level has us covered with a Warhammer-themed short. The trailer opens with a scene of Space Marines cutting a bloody swath of destruction, and later we see a marine being ambushed by a much larger monster. We also see a shot of a marine barreling straight into an oncoming vehicle. Basically, this short looks to be the most action-packed and visceral chapter of the Secret Level series. </p><h2>The Mystery Game</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/secret-level-official-reveal-trailer-2024-god-of-war-mega-man-more-gamescom-2024-0-39-screenshot-1724256065876.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the most intriguing scenes in the trailer is also one of the most mysterious. At one point we see images of a man being enveloped in flowing pink and blue energy, as if he’s bonding with a machine or another lifeform. We’re honestly not sure which game this is meant to represent, but we do know we definitely want to see this episode. </p><p>Let us know in the comments what game you think is being depicted in that scene, and let us know if we missed anything else in the trailer. </p><p>For more on gamescom, learn more about the decision to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Playstation</a>, and catch up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at Opening Night Live</a>.</p><p><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

It lets you build a replica of the Temple of the Golden Idol, complete with interactive components that let you light up the idol, collapse a wall, or unleash a boulder to chase down Indy. Four minifigures are included in the set (Indiana Jones, Satipo, Belloq, and a Hovitos Warrior), making this great as both a playset or as a piece of décor for your home theater.</p><hr><h2>Raiders of the Lost Ark: Escape from the Lost Tomb (600 pieces)</h2><h3>$32 (<del>$40</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354398-81km1syyvrl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354398" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354398-81km1syyvrl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354398"></a><figcaption>Lego Indiana Jones: Escape from the Lost Tomb</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354398-81km1syyvrl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>For a smaller and substantially cheaper project, take a look at this Escape from the Lost Tomb Lego set. It shouldn’t take too long to complete at just 600 pieces, though it still gets you four minifigures (Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Sallah, and a mummy). There are also some cool interactive components--such as a breakable wall that reveals a hidden passage and a movable Anubis statue.</p><hr><h2>Last Crusade: Fighter Plane Chase (387 pieces)</h2><h3>$28 (<del>$35</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354399-813rtdbeawl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354399" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354399-813rtdbeawl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354399"></a><figcaption>Lego Indiana Jones: Fighter Plane Chase</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4354399-813rtdbeawl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>Unlike the other two sets, which can admirably as both playsets and artwork for display, this one is most definitely a playset--but it is the cheapest way to get a display-worthy Indiana Jones minifigure. The building kit's 387 pieces snap together to create an airplane and automobile, which can be used to transport three minifigures: Indiana Jones, Indy's father, and a fighter pilot. The fighter jet has two removable wings and two stud shooters, while the car features a chest in the back that hides a pistol and umbrella.</p><hr><h3>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preorders</h3><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

                <p>Warframe 1999 is Warframe's all-new story expansion coming later this year. This expansion places players in a more-grounded environment on an alternate earth rather than the space-themed confrontations Tenno are so used to, as seen in the Level Infinite showcase.</p><p>Warframe 1999 is set on New Year's Eve, when Arthur and his fellow Hex members battle technological monstrosities, ride atomicycles--reminiscent of a motorcycle--through the streets, solve Snake-like puzzles, and face a Corrupted Lich boy band.</p>

It will be up to players to put a stop to it, and in a first for the series, it will require players to group up. The Dark Citadel will be playable with a minimum of two players, but Blizzard is recommending a full party of four to conquer its challenges. The dungeon will become available upon reaching the endgame, and players will need to complete an introductory quest that will then unlock the activity for every character on that account.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the dungeon itself, it's separated into three distinct wings. Players will need to conquer each wing before a showdown with the dungeon's final boss. Since the dungeon is far larger (and presumably takes more time) than an average Diablo 4 dungeon, players will be able to exit the dungeon and return at a later time. A new marker system will let groups more easily communicate on where to go next.</p><p dir="ltr">Each week, players will be able to earn a Weekly Rewards cache from completing the dungeon, which will grant items and rewards earned exclusively from the Dark Citadel. Players will also earn Citadel Coins while playing through the dungeon, used to unlock exclusive cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the Dark Citadel requires at least two players, Diablo 4 will gain a Party Finder feature come Vessel of Hatred's release. The Party Finder will let players search for groups depending on various in-game activities, similar to the Group Finder in something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Details about the Dark Citadel wasn't all Blizzard shared at Gamescom. It also revealed the four mercenaries players will be able to team-up with in Vessel of Hatred, and how leveling them up will differ from mercenary systems of Diablo 2 and 3.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4354546-mercenaries_1920x1080.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354546" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4354546-mercenaries_1920x1080.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354546"></a><figcaption>The four mercenaries of Diablo 4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4354546-mercenaries_1920x1080.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There will be four mercs to choose from; the shield-wielding Iron Wolves warrior Raheir, the cannibal berserker Varyana, the half-demon child Aldkin, and the drunken archer Subo. A player's chosen mercenary will join them when playing solo, but players will be able to select a second mercenary as a "Reinforcement." The mercenary set as a reinforcement can be assigned to swoop in and deliver an attack when certain conditions are met, like when hit by a movement-impairing effect. Using particular mercenaries will level up their Rapport, which can then be used to unlock additional skills. Each Mercenary will also sell items that can be bought with Pale Marks, a new currency earned by leveling up each mercenary.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the new features above will be in conjunction with the expansion's biggest addition, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">new Spiritborn class</a>, a monk-like warrior that wields powerful Spirit Guardians as weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard still has one Vessel of Hatred surprise left to unveil. It's teasing major leveling and progression changes will come to Diablo 4 once the expansion lands on par with its ambitious Loot Reborn update, "aimed at making leveling more rewarding." Fans are already confident a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-may-have-players-deal-less-damage-and-that-could-be-good/1100-6525197/" data-ref-id="1100-6525197">level-and-damage-number squish are in store</a>, but Blizzard will share official details during an upcoming Diablo 4 livestream on August 29. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred, and Diablo 4 Season 6, launch October 8</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-releases-details-on-optimizing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-on-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>BioWare released its latest development blog, which details how it has dedicated time and resources to optimizing Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The blog on their website has been titled "PC Features for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," and deep dives into all of the efforts they've put into optimizing the PC experience, with over 200,000 hours of performance and compatibility testing.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing the efforts they've put into making sure Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs smoothly across all types of PC, they mentioned that the game would also have controller support, upscaling, and ray-tracing implementation on PC, as well as its Steam Native status.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been highly anticipated for many years, with the last main franchise game being released in 2014. However, there were plenty of spin-offs to supplement Dragon Age fans and books and comics galore.</p>
<p>In the blog post released by BioWare, they mention that the majority of those who play Dragon Age in the office are on PCs, giving them a boost in optimizing the experience for PC users. When BioWare was testing Dragon Age: The Veilguard, 40% of the platform testing effort comprised of PCs.</p>
<p>The blog post talks about trying to make the game as accessible to the general audience as possible, hence the addition of controller support such as DualSense controllers with haptic support and the standard Xbox controllers. Of course, playing with a keyboard and mouse is the standard option. For players that like to mix up how they play the game, they added a seamless transition between keyboard and mouse to the controller, so you can swap back and forth as much as you like.</p>
<p>In addition to controller support, Bioware has made it so you can have class-specific key binds. For example, if you have a Rogue Rook, you can have specific key binds that can change if you swap classes, and your Rogue keybinds will remain unedited until you change them.</p>
<p>So that you don't risk overheating your PC, BioWare has added many graphics settings, including 21:9 Ultrawide monitor support, which, surprisingly, isn't that common in PC games. Players can uncap their frame rate, add <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/">optional upscaling</a>, disable the Cinematic Aspect Ratio, and many more.</p>
<p>For the full details of every graphic setting added to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you can check out the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/pc-features?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> made by BioWare to find out whether this game will be feasible for you on PC.</p>

The film was a gritter and more realistic take on the famous Batman villain, with Phoenix playing a more tragic and broken version of the Joker than previously seen in live-action movies and TV. And in the upcoming sequel, Phillips is trying to do something similar with Harley Quinn. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/features/todd-phillips-joker-2-movie-interview-1236111122/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/features/todd-phillips-joker-2-movie-interview-1236111122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a></span>, Philips explained the origin behind the sequel, why it’s a musical, and what it was like working with Phoneix again on a new <em>Joker </em>film. But he also talked about Harley Quinn, played by Gaga, and explained that his version of the character would be very different. </p><p>“The high voice, that accent, the gum-chewing, and all that sort of sassy stuff that’s in the comics, we stripped that away,” said Phillips. “We wanted her to fit into this world of Gotham that we created from the first movie.”<br></p><p>In a video posted by <em>Variety</em>, Phillips further explained that Gaga is doing what Phoenix did with Joker and creating her “own take” on the famous character. </p><p>“We tried to respect the animated series, the comics, the movies, but run it through a really realistic lens like we did [in Joker,]” said Phillips. It should be noted that in <em>Joker 2</em>, Harley Quinn isn’t a doctor at the Arkham, but instead a patient, which is another big change. <br></p><p>Of course, many online weren’t happy about this. And while it is true that other <em>Batman </em>characters have been depicted in various ways over the years, it does seem odd to toss out the entire foundation of the character but keep her name. But then again, this is its own universe disconnected from other DC movies or comics, so it makes sense that the people involved would want to experiment and try new things. I’m curious to see if this experimentation will be worth it when the sequel arrives in October. </p><p>As for <em>Joker 3</em>, well, it sounds unlikely that Phillips will return, telling <em>Variety</em>: “It was fun to play in this sort of sandbox for two movies, but I think we’ve said what we wanted to say in this world.” </p><p>However, if this movie does as well as <em>Joker</em>, don’t be surprised if WB goes out and finds someone else to direct a third one. They’ll likely also dump as much money in front of Phoenix as needed to bring him back for one more sequel. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dune: Awakening is at Gamescom 2024, and with its appearance comes over 25 minutes of new gameplay. </p>



<p>In this new presentation, creative director Joel Bylos walks players through “an extended look at the player’s journey from scavenging survivor to powerful spice hunter.”</p>

<iframe title="Dune: Awakening – Gamescom Gameplay Presentation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J18oH_FBDYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The video starts with a look at the game’s character creation before moving into actual gameplay. Throughout, you get a look at the game’s world, it’s combat, various mechanics, and more. </p>



<p>Regarding combat, Bylos says that, “at heart”, Dune: Awakening is a third-person shooter with melee and abilities. You can see that in action around the 11-minute mark in the video above.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-dune-awakening">About Dune: Awakening</h2>



<p>“Dune: Awakening is an open world survival MMO set on the most dangerous planet in the universe,” the game’s description reads. “Survive the desert by learning the ways of the Fremen. Expand your potential through combat, spice, building, and trade. As guild intrigue and warfare rage, control the spice and cling to power.”</p>



<p>The game is set to launch in early 2025. A beta for Dune: Awakening is expected soon, and you can sign up for it on the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>.</p>
