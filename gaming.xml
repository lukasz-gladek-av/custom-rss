		<p>Frontier Developments has shared a 15 minute deep dive into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> and the new water parks that are the new star attraction in this them park management sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Deep Dive 1 - Coasters and Water Parks Combined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/82gEWEdDn78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game Director Rich Newbold and Senior Executive Producer Adam Woods are on hand to give the demonstration, showing off a work-in-progress sandbox from a development build of the game.</p>
<p>They show off the geometric and custom shape pools you can make, the way that water flumes can be constructed – still balancing excitement, fear and nausea, just like the regular coasters – the new needs for things like changing rooms, wider concourses and more. Guests have also been redesigned to give more diversity of character models, broader animations to show how they’re feeling, and even the ability to get a nasty sunburn if you don’t supply sun screen for your guests!</p>
<p>Flat rides and coasters are obviously still very plentiful, and Frontier have made new rides and revamped previous ones. The humble teacups ride is now more plain to allow you to apply more customisations and themes, such as adding more of an underwater theme with scenery that can animate and move around with the ride. All rides will come with pre-defined, selectable patterns, too.</p>

<p>The next deep dive video will be exploring the new and the improved tools that players will get to use to create and manage these parks, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more on show in the deep dive, and we got a chance to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/planet-coaster-2-preview-slip-and-slide-into-the-wet-stuff/">preview</a> the game ahead of its big announcement last month. I said, “It’s been a hot minute since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> released back in 2016, and since the last expansion arrived in 2019. It’s high time to dive back in, and Planet Coaster 2 looks set to delight with its new options and deeper management.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is coming out this autumn across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-blizzard-aa-team-might-give-microsoft-its-smaller-games-report-says.943200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-aa-team-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new internal studio has reportedly been formed at Blizzard, with a view towards making smaller AA-level projects within the company's existing franchises and IP.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by Windows Central</a>, Microsoft and Activision have created a "new smaller team within Blizzard comprised of King and various other employees", and that team will work on games in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>,&nbsp;<em>StarCraft</em>, and more.</p>
<p>Windows Central's report points to the fact that many employees of King.com, which is a Microsoft subsidiary thanks to its inclusion within the Activision Blizzard umbrella, have recently changed their LinkedIn profiles to reflect a move to Blizzard. According to Windows Central's "sources", those moves represent the creation of a new internal development outfit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-blizzard-aa-studio-charge.jpg?itok=wA_FTyiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-blizzard-aa-studio-charge.jpg?itok=Y2UbnCCo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New games based on Blizzard franchises like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>might be coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The report says that the new studio, which mainly comprises employees from King, is part of a desire on Microsoft's part to "curate and serve these franchises more prolifically than Activision itself did" prior to the tech giant's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">record-breaking acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>As Windows Central points out, King's involvement in the creation of this studio could indicate that the games being created are intended for mobile, but given that Microsoft appears to be adopting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024">platform-agnostic approach</a>, we might also see them on PC and Xbox consoles as well, and perhaps even on other platforms in future.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Microsoft is keen to create games that avoid what Windows Central calls "the monstrously ballooning costs facing AAA game development", a subject about which Microsoft is reportedly anxious. Creating smaller studios that can collaborate with the larger organization is one way in which Microsoft is looking to alleviate these costs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starcraft-2-blizzard-aa-studio.jpg?itok=NfwmPErA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starcraft-2-blizzard-aa-studio.jpg?itok=imcUMDBX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>StarCraft&nbsp;</em>games could be on the way, although they may not be what you're used to.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping up with Microsoft news, then you might be wondering how the company's decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">close&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango and&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin</a> ties in with this new Blizzard studio's formation, and, indeed, with Microsoft's stated aim to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">develop more "smaller games"</a>.</p>
<p>Well, according to Windows Central's report, Tango was indeed the right kind of studio for the job, but its location in Japan made "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult". Seems like a bit of an overreaction to close the studio down completely for that reason, but I'm not privy to Microsoft's internal conversations, I suppose.</p>
<p>Microsoft's decision to create smaller games, and its reported concern about the spiraling costs of AAA development, come amongst widespread layoffs and studio closures in the gaming industry, including staff being let go at companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft itself</a>, among many others.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of games this new Blizzard studio creates. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>It is expected sometime later this month, though.</p>

            <p>Once Human's maintenance is now complete, and the F2P open-world shooter is back online with a plethora of QoL improvements and optimisations, including a desperately-needed revision to vehicle handling.</p>
<p>Whilst players received a bundle of Stardust and health-related items to make up for the downtime, Once Human's long-promised controller and Steam Deck support is still nowhere to be seen (although, confusingly, the "controller" in-game item remains in place).</p>

<p>In terms of Memetics, you can now pick up memetic specialisation memory fragments in the wild and trade them between players. All memetic fragments will be destroyed at the end of the season – which is in a couple of weeks time – and cannot be sent to Eternaland, so be mindful of that.</p>
<p>The team has also "enriched" the Highway Pursuit game mode, added a new route, and fixed the starting time to 9pm local time on all servers. The map has also been revised to make it easier to see landmarks, as well as send invitations to other players via chat channels.</p>
<p>There's loads more – combat, planting, trading, wilderness, deviations, cosmetics, performance, camera; pretty much everything's had a tweak, it seems – so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/">head on over to Steam for the full details</a>.</p>
<p>Starry Studio has also provided a new storage crate to all players in compensation for "recent server stability" when unsuccessfully trying to implement cross-character paid content sharing.</p>
<p>The team also outlined what to expect from the new August Event.</p>
<p>"On Nalcott Island, the month of August itself is an anomalous event," the team teases. "During this 'forgotten summer', we will receive additional produce from harvesting every week. More events will be gradually unlocked in the game. All Metas are welcome to participate!"</p>
<p>In terms of controller support; despite a lot of players hoping support would come in this patch, the team says it's hoping to roll out functionality by "mid-August".</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460?emclan=103582791472471292&amp;emgid=4329732329530020404">players affected by the territory glitch</a> should find any resources they used to build their base returned to their backpacks.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it earlier this month for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back.</p>
<p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In recent weeks, King employees have swapped their LinkedIn information, saying that they are now working specifically in Blizzard. This comes in conjunction with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-agree-with-ftc-comments-regarding-price-hikes/">Microsoft</a> and Activision's new team, which has been created within Blizzard.</p>
<p>This team takes employees from King and other various Blizzard employees and is now a focused team dedicated to working on Blizzard's "AA" games, such as World of Warcraft, Overwatch, StarCraft, and more.</p>
<p>The expansion doesn't come as much of a surprise, as Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard last year for a hefty $72 billion. This gave Microsoft leverage over some of its major franchises, such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. With the acquisition, Microsoft has already seen a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge 61% growth year-on-year</a> in its gaming division, largely driven by Activision Blizzard's current games.</p>
<p>To continue boosting their growth, Microsoft and Activision have teamed up to create a new team within the Blizzard subsidiary. The aim is to continue curating and keeping their most beloved franchises alive, such as Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch. StarCraft has been dead in the water for some time, and it is possible that this new team will revive the beloved franchise and give it a new lease of life instead.</p>
<p>Since many of the employees joining the team are from the King subsidiary, it's very possible that they are working on mobile ports of these games or on making Diablo Immortal a better game for those who continue to play it. Alternatively, it's possible that they will be working on new mobile games that are set to be released in Xbox's mobile game store, which is planned for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Microsoft is keen to experiment with utilizing smaller teams that are more agile and have more potential when working on AA games. These teams will also be integrated into the larger teams, giving them access to bigger projects as and when they need it. There is plenty of potential for AA games at the moment, with games like Balatro, Palworld, Vampire Survivors, and Stardew Valley doing extremely well in current markets, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Despite their willingness to try and experiment with smaller teams, Microsoft is also responsible for closing down Tango Gameworks, the developers behind the well-loved title Hi-Fi Rush. The decision to make smaller studios and work on indie-style games may come as a shock considering the brash decision to close down Tango Gameworks, but we'll have to wait and see what's in store for the players with this new team.</p>

Since then, the Olympics has somehow kept producing shooters who all seem like they could be the main characters of some game or movie. Yusuf Dikeç, a shooter from Turkey, is the latest phenomenon to emerge from the Games, and let me tell you, I think <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/hitman&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/hitman"><em>Hitman</em></a></span>’s Agent 47 should be very scared of this man.<br></p><p>Similar to Ye-ji, Dikeç began going viral for his shooting stance. However, unlike the South Korean crackshot, Dikeç started making the rounds for his relaxed appearance and lack of any significant equipment. Ye-ji became a quick favorite for her stylized pose and steely-eyed look, but by comparison, Dikeç’s star is ascending because homeboy looks like he could barely be bothered to show up. Dude straight up doesn’t look like he gives a fuck, and yet he managed to take home silver in his category.</p><p>When asked about his lack of equipment, do you know what Dikeç said? “I did not need special equipment. I’m a natural, a natural shooter.” The aura coming off this guy is <em>unbelievable</em>, and just like Ye-ji, it’s inspired people around the world to now idolize him, turn him into a meme, produce fan art, and reinterpret him and his stance into their favorite video games and anime. </p><p>Ye-ji and Dikeç have emerged as the stars of the shooting category, but they aren’t the only competitors to have popped off online. Sarabjot Singh from India has also been turned into a bit of a meme, as well as Choe Daehan, another shooter from South Korea, whose very pronounced shooting style is probably best seen rather than described:</p><p>And then there’s this legend.

Developed by Massive Entertainment, the studio behind The Division series, it'll tell the tale of Kay Vess: a wandering outlaw looking to assemble a team to pull off the heist of a lifetime as she attempts to rob the powerful head of one of the galaxy's most threatening crime syndicates.</p><p>Boasting a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-the-final-preview">massive open world to explore</a>, freeform combat encounters that can be completed stealthily or all-guns-blazing, and narrative choices that affect your reputation with factions, Outlaws appears to be a massive playable heist movie that throws you directly into some of the most wretched hives of scum and villainy in the galaxy.</p><div catalogid="e75dd931-1911-43db-b0fb-8e7c20d016dc" id="198974"><div id="198974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><h3>Star Wars Eclipse - Early Development</h3><p>Announced back in 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a> looks to be Quantic Dream's twist on the Star Wars universe, with the Detroit Become Human developer promising a narrative-focused adventure that reacts to your decisions.</p><p>Although details are currently pretty slim, we do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/how-star-wars-eclipse-links-the-high-republic-to-prequel-trilogy-jedi-fallen-order">it'll take place in the High Republic Era</a>, meaning it will be set around the same time as the recent Disney Plus show, Star Wars: The Acolyte. Quantic Dream also revealed that, despite their previous games focusing largely on dialogue and storytelling, Eclipse will definitively be an action-adventure and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-fundamentals-quantic-dream-action-adventure">the team has made changes to accompany the heavier focus on action sequences</a>. </p><p>Although we don't know exactly what that means for the game just yet, we could be looking at the studio moving away from its heavy use of quick-time events and embracing a new approach to combat and chase sequences. Regardless, it's safe to assume Eclipse's core focus will be telling a branching narrative that evolves and adapts to your choices, so be prepared to make tough decisions and live with the consequences.</p><h3>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake - In Development</h3><p>The return of a bonafide classic, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a> was first revealed back in 2021 as a PlayStation 5 and PC exclusive. Developed by Saber Interactive, it aims to be a full, from-the-ground-up reimagining of BioWare's seminal 2003 Star Wars RPG of the same name.</p><p>The original Knights of the Old Republic dropped players into the Old Republic era, casting them as an amnesiac soldier who wakes up on a crashing Republic ship. Escaping the craft before it's destroyed, the protagonist sets out on a quest to uncover their murky past and defeat Darth Malak: a ruthless Sith lord and the commander of an army of Sith warriors. Boasting tactical combat, a deep morality system and a full galaxy to explore, Knights of the Old Republic was heralded as not only one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games">best Star Wars games ever made</a>, but one of the best RPGs of all time.</p><p>Despite recent reports that the remake's development had halted, Saber Interactive revealed to us in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">an interview back in April</a> that it's still "alive and well." Although the full details of the remake aren't currently known, it's sure to try and recapture the magic of the original game, while updating its systems, visuals and gameplay for modern audiences.</p><h3>Amy Hennig's New Star Wars Project - In Development</h3><p>First announced back in 2022, Skydance Media unveiled that it was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amy-hennig-star-wars-skydance-new-media">a new game set in the Star Wars universe</a>. Better yet, the studio revealed it would be bringing in former Uncharted director, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-captain-america-black-pather-amy-hennig-game-revealed-state-of-unreal-2024">Amy Hennig</a>, to work on the project. </p><p>With Hennig currently hard at work on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-captain-america-black-pather-amy-hennig-game-revealed-state-of-unreal-2024">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, details on her venture into the Star Wars universe are few and far between, although the announcement did reveal that it will be a cinematic action-adventure that tells an original story. Considering Hennig has an aptitude for thrilling adventures with engrossing narratives, her take on a galaxy far, far away is definitely one to watch, even if it seems to be in the very early stages.</p><h3>Bit Reactor's Star Wars Strategy Game - In Development</h3><p>Another Star Wars title that's still in early production, EA announced back in 2022 that Respawn Entertainment was producing a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-respawn-bit-reactor-strategy-project">Star Wars strategy game</a>, with developer Bit Reactor taking the reins.</p><p>Similar to Skydance Media's Star Wars title, outside of the base details, we know very little about what to expect from the project other than it'll tackle the series from a strategy perspective. However, Bit Reactor is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-respawn-ea-jedi-fallen-order-sequel-fps-strategy-xcom">comprised of former Firaxis veterans heralded for their work on the XCOM franchise</a>, so there's a very good chance we're in for a treat.</p><h3>Star Wars Jedi 3 - In Development</h3><p>One that shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering the acclaim of its two predecessors, EA and Respawn Entertainment have confirmed that they are indeed working on a third Star Wars Jedi game. Following the cancellation of Respawn's in-development Star Wars first-person shooter earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-is-canceled-but-work-on-next-jedi-game-black-panther-and-iron-man-will-continue">the company confirmed they were committed to offering a sequel to the Jedi series</a>, announcing it was in the works.</p><p>Considering it's definitely early days for the threequel, there's very little to go off, although it appears <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-jedi-survivor/Cal_Kestis">Cal Kestis</a> will be back in the saddle as the lead protagonist. Cameron Monaghan, the actor who potrays Kestis, revealed during the Star Wars: Jedi Game Series Panel at Ocala Comic Con last year that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cal-kestis-actor-in-the-process-of-making-star-wars-jedi-3">he was already working with Respawn on a third entry</a>.</p><p>If the previous two Jedi games are anything to go off, this third title will likely focus on players once again exploring the galaxy as Cal Kestis, going head to head with enemies in intense third-person lightsaber combat, using force-based abilities to traverse precarious environments and solving physics-based puzzles.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

                <p>There's another Silent Hill game reportedly in development, this time being worked on internally over at Konami. After years of the Silent Hill series being dormant, Konami recently let other third-party studios tackle it. However, it looks like Konami will still continue to make its own Silent Hill games.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1819243908007624765" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insider Dusk Golem</a>, Konami still has a couple other unannounced projects in the works, including a new Silent Hill game. However, they didn't provide any other information, such as whether it'd be another remake.</p>

      </div>
<p>Konami is committed to releasing new Silent Hill games after a strong Q1 2024 performance, with the Silent Hill 2 remake launching later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-townfall-teaser-trailer-revealed/1100-6508442/" data-ref-id="1100-6508442">Silent Hill Townfall</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">Silent Hill F</a> are still in development with no official release window announced yet. There's not much information about former, but the latter is the nineth mainline entry in the series.</p><p>The two most recent entries in the series are <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-ascension/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill: Ascension</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-the-short-message-review-in-my-restless-dreams-i-flee-that-town/1900-6418173/" data-ref-id="1900-6418173">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>. Unfortunately, the reception for both games has been negative from both fans and critics alike.</p><p>Silent Hill 2 remake is set to launch on October 7 for PC and PS5. A new Silent Hill movie is also in production right now, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-shares-return-to-silent-hill-movie-teaser/1100-6523860/" data-ref-id="1100-6523860">Return to Silent Hill</a>, which will see both Pyramid Head and Dark Nurses returning from the original movies.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has shared the unfortunate news that they have delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> indefinitely.</p>
<p>Prison Architect 2 had already been delayed a couple times, most recently aiming for 3rd September and with the announcement that the development was being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/prison-architect-2-developer-double-eleven-breaks-up-with-paradox-interactive/">handed over from original studio Double Eleven to new team at Kokku</a>, but even that has been pulled back as they “re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready.”</p>


<p>There will be minimal communication about the game’s development through the coming weeks and months, until such a time that Kokku and Paradox feel ready to share something substantial.</p>
<p>Given the form of this delay, all pre-orders are being refunded automatically, though you will be able to request an expedited refund, as <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">detailed in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the latest blow to Paradox’s game line up. Cities: Skylines 2 launched last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">to great dissatisfaction from players</a>, with developer Colossal Order having now spent the better part of the year optimising the game and reworking gameplay elements. Last year’s The Lamplighters League also underperformed, and more recently, Paradox cancelled and shut down the studio behind their The Sims competitor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-cancelled-by-paradox/">Life By You</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the Prison Architect 2 statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have some difficult news to share: unfortunately, we will not release Prison Architect 2 on September 3rd because we need more time to improve both the game’s performance and its content. Our continuous internal reviews and beta test groups have highlighted areas that we need to focus on more, mainly performance and content, which we need to address before launch to ensure that you, the players, get a good experience in the game. We need to raise the quality a bit more to meet the standards we’d like to achieve with this sequel.</p>
<p>We are confident that the sequel to Prison Architect will be great, and we’re looking forward to showing you all the new ideas brought into it: the switch to 3D, multi-floors, and the new behavior system that all bring a new dimension to the game and open new gameplay possibilities for the players. However, we want to make sure the game lives up to the franchise’s legacy and is released in a state that satisfies both you, our players, and the Prison Architect 2 teams at Kokku and Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>At this stage, we can’t commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready. Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>With this indefinite delay, preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and the preorder items will be added to the base game.</p>
<p>This decision aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content. We are confident that delaying Prison Architect 2 is the best path forward for the game, allowing us more time to deliver a high-quality experience that honors the legacy of Prison Architect.</p>
<p>This is not the announcement we hoped to make, but it is necessary, as we believe this will result in a better game for you. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you again soon.</p>
<p>The Prison Architect 2 Team</p></blockquote>

Its 2005 release made it the last <em>Pokémon </em>game on Game Boy Advance, and the first of seven in the ongoing series. However, it wasn’t the first <em>Mystery Dungeon</em> game, Chunsoft having used the same name for many previous crossovers, including <em>Final Fantasy</em> and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/"><em>Shiren the Wanderer</em></a></span> series of games, since 1993. While those games all have the same core systems, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team Red</em> was a perfect combination that makes it shine.</p><p>After three generations of mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games, one of the biggest draws of<em> Red Rescue Team</em> was that it put you in the shoes of the Pokémon. There is a mystical story that begins with you, as a normal human in the world, being somehow transformed into a Pokémon. The specific monster you transform into is decided by a short personality test. I remember starting over the game multiple times the first time I put in my cartridge, in order to get exactly who I wanted: Mudkip.</p><p>The world of <em>Red Rescue Team</em> is a quaint town populated by talking Pokémon, all with their own lives. It’s all adorably rendered in the GBA’s beautiful graphics, and even two decades later there’s a wonderful charm to it.</p><p>The gameplay loop centers on exploring multi-floor roguelike dungeons, with the aid of your team (all cute talking Pokémon), in search of specific NPCs you have been hired to rescue. You progress through dungeons by moving on a grid via a turn-based system, and enter combat against enemies you encounter. Exploring every crevice of a dungeon is a thrilling and sometimes dangerous adventure, and it offers a different take on <em>Pokémon </em>battles. As a little kid who had played her copy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165"><em>Pokémon Sapphire</em></a></span> until the internal battery died, it felt so fresh and exciting.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team </em>also has an amazing story. On top of figuring out how and why you were turned into a Pokémon, every NPC you meet is a great character to spend time with as you unravel their own secrets. Mixed with a fun story about chasing down a rival rescue team, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</em> packs a lot of narrative into its deceptively small package.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team</em> actually has a Switch remake in the form of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962"><em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em></a></span>. It’s pretty great and has its own unique painterly art style. It does cost $60, though. So if you are intrigued by the game, just wait till the original version drops on Switch Online on August 9. I’d also recommend the GBA version over the remake, just for the endlessly charming graphics. Now when are we getting a <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky</em> remake?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the Dead by Daylight team revealed its 2024 roadmap for live updates coming to the game through November 2024.</p>



<p>These live updates will include various improvements for quality of life, as well as tweaks and updates for perks and killers.</p>



<p>August will be the busiest month in the roadmap, with 10 new updates. Players will see quality-of-life and gameplay updates for scratch marks and Midwich Elementary School. </p>



<p>The first killers to receive new tweaks are Doctor, Nemesis, and Dredge. The first perk tweaks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're more than halfway through the year 📅 time to check in with the live updates the team will be working on for the rest of 2024. </p><p>As always, timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress. <a href="https://t.co/Dnw68eMpqp">pic.twitter.com/Dnw68eMpqp</a></p></div>— Dead by Daylight (@DeadbyDaylight) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a highlight from the roadmap of live updates, the Dead by Daylight team is planning perk updates for Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush. </p>



<p>These changes will arrive sometime between September and October 2024, and they could shake up the meta more so than minor tweaks.</p>



<p>Naturally, the developers did warn fans that “timelines may change, but we’ll keep you updated as we progress.” There are no exact release dates, but the roadmap adds that the monthly release windows are “subject to change based on development needs.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Dead by Daylight kept the summer season busy with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-roadmap-revealed-for-july-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major July updates</a>.  Those included the anticipated 2v8 mode and cross-progression. It also featured the somewhat divisive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addition of Lara Croft</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-pokemon-mystery-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that beloved dungeon-crawler&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch Online next week.</p>
<p>Naturally, just like any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba">other</a> Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online">game</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-gba-mario">service</a>, you're going to need the Expansion Pack addon to play this one, but assuming you've got it, the dungeon-delving RPG will be available to enjoy on August 9th, which is next Friday.</p>
<p>Like many other&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>has a different-colored counterpart, but&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>was a Nintendo DS exclusive, and since DS games haven't yet come to Switch Online (and are unlikely to do so, although we can hope things will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">change for the Switch 2</a>), you'll have to content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team</em>.</p>

<p>Storywise, the game sees the player transformed into a Pokemon themselves and stricken with amnesia, setting out on a journey to discover their true identity alongside a partner Pokemon. It's essentially a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>isekai story. What's not to love?</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>were remade for Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-coming-in-march">as&nbsp;<em>Rescue Team DX&nbsp;</em>back in March</a>, but needless to say, this version isn't the Switch remake; it's the GBA original in all its crunchy retro pixel goodness.</p>

<p>If you want to play&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team</em>, you'll need the Switch Online Expansion Pack, which also grants access to libraries of N64 and Sega Genesis games, as well as DLC for games like&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>.</p>
<p>The game's announcement for the service comes at the same time as the release of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025">first-quarter financial information</a>, which has seen profits and sales drop ahead of an expected Nintendo Switch 2 announcement sometime in the next few months.

			<p>Compared to other games like Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield doesn't look as good, but the game developed by Bethesda can still be made to look great with select mods that improve its visuals</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> on YouTube shows the latest RPG by Bethesda running at 8K resolution on an RTX 4090 GPU with the Beyond all Limits Reshade ray tracing preset and over 50 mods, including the Natural and Atmospheric Space LUT. Besides showing how good the game can look with mods, the video also shows how the RTX 4090 GPU is an absolute beast of a graphics card, as it can run the game at 8K resolution at above 100 frames per second, save for more populated areas like cities, with the help of NVIDIA DLSS 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Starfield - DLSS3 Raytracing Beyondalllimits - Ultra Modded Graphic Gameplay - 50+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIyFvuM1w8k?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been almost a year since Starfield released on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and soon enough, players will be able to experience additional content thanks to the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/">Shattered Space</a> expansion. More content is also rumored to be coming as part of the next free update, which will supposedly add the<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/"> land vehicles</a> that were revealed a while back to be in the works. A second expansion named <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a> also seems to be in the works.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the game by checking out my&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-that-mobile-store-testing-has-begun/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> by Tom Warren, Xbox has offered a direct statement to The Verge revealing that testing is under way for the Xbox mobile store.</p>



<p>Head of Xbox communications Kari Perez reportedly said that “testing has begun for our browser-based mobile store.” They also added that “our work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p>



<p>Warren also pointed to the recent <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1817944795127419045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from Klobrille, who spotted a notable Xbox Insiders message earlier this week. </p>



<p>The message claimed that the Xbox Mobile Store is “coming soon,” and mentions holdback groups for a testing process.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In May 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-launching-xbox-mobile-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> the anticipated mobile store with a July 2024 release window. The mobile store was notably absent as July came to a close. </p>



<p>Perez did not offer further details about the cause for delay, nor a concrete date for more updates.</p>



<p>During Bond’s original announcement, Xbox confirmed the mobile store would first launch with a first-party portfolio. As a result, fans can expect popular titles like Minecraft to appear first.</p>



<p>Bond also said that “we’re going to start on the web,” since that will be “accessible across all devices, all countries.”</p>



<p>Xbox is currently preparing to bring its “biggest booth yet” to Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-gamescom-2024-details-bringing-over-50-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting over 50 titles</a> for the event.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-profits-plummet-as-big-switch-releases-dry-up.943098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year (since the company tracks its year starting from April), and profits aren't looking great, although there's arguably a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Per the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial highlights</a>, "ordinary profit" and net profit are down 55.3% on a year-over-year basis, while operating profit has fallen by 70.6% compared to the first quarter of last year, which is a pretty precipitous drop. Net sales, meanwhile, are down 46.5%.</p>
<p>Arguably, however, that's to be expected. We're in what is probably going to be the final year of the Nintendo Switch's life <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">before the Switch 2 is released</a>, and so major releases for the existing console are drying up, although both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-version-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</em>&nbsp;were released in this first quarter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=JLFqnDBw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=oX58gr0H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>were released for Switch this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that, as Nintendo itself points out in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supplementary document</a>, sales were buoyed last year by the release of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million">huge seller</a> for Nintendo (as you'd expect given that it belongs to one of the company's tentpole franchises).</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which was released last year and which proved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats">phenomenally popular among moviegoers</a>, further bolstered Nintendo's sales in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, and it's obviously unable to do so again this quarter. In short, Nintendo had a pretty extraordinary year last year, and there's nothing quite as totemic to help the company out so far this year.</p>
<p>However, that's not to say that Nintendo is doing poorly.&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>has sold 1.76 million units to date, according to Nintendo, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at 1.19 million, both fairly respectable figures for games that aren't mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials-forest.jpg?itok=bNYudOYg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials-forest.jpg?itok=5PJKfmZ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>has been a respectable seller for Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>In general, Nintendo's latest financial report paints a picture of declining profits and sales for the company, but given that we're at the end of the Switch's lifespan (and a hugely successful lifespan at that), this kind of decline is entirely predictable.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Nintendo does anything to turn things around, but it's likely that the next major Nintendo franchise releases will arrive alongside whatever the Switch 2 turns out to be. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s already sold 2.1 million last quarter, which means it somehow needs to sell 11.4 million more this summer into the holiday season and beyond. If achieved, that would put it in spitting distance of the lifetime sales of the PlayStation 2, the best-selling console ever, known to have sold 155 million as of 2012. Maybe that’s why former Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-reveals-ps2-sold-160-million-units-worldwide&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-reveals-ps2-sold-160-million-units-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parting gift was to move the goal posts</a></span> by announcing that the PS2 (which he helped market) ultimately went on to sell 160 million units. </p><p>It’s still possible the Switch could hit that number years into the lifecycle of a successor like a Switch 2, but analysts are skeptical given the lack of officially announced big sellers in the pipeline and the fact that total Switch sales the year that both<em> Zelda: TOTK</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>came out were barely 15 million. “I really wonder how Nintendo wants to achieve their hardware sales target,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/nintendo-s-profit-slides-as-consumers-await-new-flagship-console?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/nintendo-s-profit-slides-as-consumers-await-new-flagship-console?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Bloomberg</em> today</a></span>. “I am skeptical if Nintendo still has enough fuel in the tank, especially if they plan to get to the target without hardware price reductions.”</p><p>A price cut is indeed one way that Nintendo could spur on new sales. While the company released the cheaper Switch Lite at $200, the stronger seller continues to be the Switch OLED at $350. Knocking $50 off of that hardware, which is running on several-year old specs at this point, would be a big deal. It’s also possible that Nintendo is still holding one or two big surprises up its sleeve for the fall and winter. And we shouldn’t underestimate the power of <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>—<em>Super Mario Party</em> remains the seventh best-selling game on Switch—and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>could be a system mover despite its more old-school look. </p><p>But without a new <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, it seems more likely that 2024 will be the Switch’s weakest since 2018. Maybe there are a few more special edition Switches laying around. The gold one for <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> does look sharp, and convincing players to buy newer limited edition models while passing their older ones down to younger family members or friends is traditionally how Nintendo juices its handheld metrics. We’ll see if that’s the case this time around and the Switch threatens the PS2 for best-selling console of all time or stalls out like everyone expects. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When you’ve been one of the faces of <em>Star Wars</em> for nearly 50 years, you’re bound to get tired of people asking you big lore questions when you were only there to pick up a paycheck.

So why does he do it? Money, naturally.</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236091166/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236091166/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, Ford talked about the motion capture process he went through shooting the film, specifically regarding Ross’s Red Hulk transformation seen in <em>Brave New World</em>. When asked about what it took, his response was a very candid, Harrison Ford answer:</p><p>“It took not caring,” Ford told <em>Variety</em>. “It took being an idiot for money, which I’ve done before. I don’t mean to disparage it. I’m just saying you have to do certain things that normally your mother would not want you to do—or your acting coach, if you had one. But it’s fun, and I enjoyed it. I had a great time, and I’m delighted at the response that we got with the trailer.”</p><p>If you consider what playing a Hulk probably entails, I can imagine why Ford would describe it as having to essentially let loose and be “an idiot.” You gotta dress up in a motion capture suit and pretend to be a big, lumbering beast. That requires being a bit silly, and if you’re paid to do it, that’s a plus.</p><p>Ford takes over the role of Thaddeus Ross for <em>Brave New World</em>, the military figure-cum-president previously portrayed in five MCU movies by a mustachioed William Hurt, who sadly died in 2022. Ford will then reprise the role in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2 next year.</p><p>Ford’s comments on feeling like an idiot playing Red Hulk will probably catch some sideways looks from some Marvel fans, who demand it be taken with the utmost seriousness.

                <p>According to a new report, Microsoft and Activision are creating a new team inside Blizzard that will create "AA" games based on existing Blizzard properties.

Another benefit of making lower-budget games with smaller teams is that it could reduce the likelihood of "bureaucratic bloat" that can exist within big organizations, the report said.</p><p>This new AA studio would exist alongside Xbox's larger teams making games on bigger budgets.</p><p>Separately, the report mentioned how Halo developer 343 Industries has undergone a shift with the aim of becoming a "more streamlined single-team organization."

While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23660809/wordle-new-york-times-interview-zoe-bell-gdc-2023"><em>The New York Times</em> is leading the way with <em>Wordle</em> and its iconic crossword</a>, major companies ranging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">Netflix</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145605/linkedin-gaming-puzzle-game-nyt-wordle-netflix-games">LinkedIn</a> are trying to carve out a place as well. So, when game designer Zach Gage, cofounder of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst-owned site Puzzmo</a>, started exploring the space, he knew the project needed more than great games. He says the goal was to “design a website that isn’t just links to games but is in fact a deeper community experience.” That’s why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">Puzzmo launched last year</a> with a handful of titles and multiplayer features like leaderboards.</p><p>Now both of those aspects are expanding with a new game that’s also introducing new ways to play — inspired by some of the biggest online shooters around.</p><p>Back in June, the site introduced <em>Pile-Up Poker</em>, a game that takes the rules of poker — namely the various hands — and turns it into a solitaire-like experience with the goal of earning a high score in the form of virtual cash. It’s a great addition to Puzzmo’s growing library of word games and other puzzles. It also came with a communitywide goal for everyone to work toward: earning a collective $1 trillion of in-game money. The idea is that every Puzzmo player contributes a little bit each day over time by playing <em>Pile-Up Poker</em> and racking up dollars. (Games like <em>Fortnite</em> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1b51hyq/pandora_box_damage_already_above_10_less_than_90/">similarly experimented</a> with these kinds of collective goals.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Pile-Up Poker.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Puzzmo</cite></p></div><p>As the community pot grows closer to the goal, new features will be added for everyone. At launch, there was a deck of physical cards designed by <em>BoJack Horseman</em> artist Lisa Hanawalt, and just last week, Puzzmo added the option for clubs — in-game friend groups — to have their own custom, game-specific leaderboards so they can compare scores in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/18/14961332/typeshift-iphone-ipad-word-game-zach-gage"><em>TypeShift</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>. The tool is built to be flexible, so people can create hyperspecific ways to play with their friends.</p><p>This idea of ongoing support and updates comes from the battle passes found in games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. Gage is a hardcore <em>Apex Legends</em> player (he even does meetings inside of the shooter) and believes that the nature of a battle pass, with goals that encourage daily play, can nurture a more dedicated audience. “When you play every day, you start to care about the patch notes,” he explains. “It turns you into a quality community member instead of a person who is just stepping in and playing the game. You become invested.”</p><p>There are downsides, of course. A typical battle pass requires a huge investment from the developer to constantly make new in-game items for players, like <em>Fortnite</em>’s never-ending production line of skins. Daily missions can also become checklists for players rather than fun experiences. “Sometimes I have found myself playing a battle pass and wondered, ‘What am I doing? Why am I even playing this game right now? This is a waste of my time,’” Gage says. “That is a feeling that I don’t want anyone to have with any game that I’m making.”</p><div><p>“When you play every day, you start to care about the patch notes.”</p></div><p>Community objectives like the <em>Pile-Up Poke</em>r pot, which are designed sort of like Kickstarter stretch goals, solve these problems in a few ways. They don’t require much additional work for the developers since the upcoming features were already part of the roadmap. And players don’t experience the same kind of FOMO because, even if you miss a day or two, the rest of the community is still building toward those goals. At the same time, the process of hitting such a huge number has given a nice jolt to the community, according to Gage, citing vibrant discussions in the Puzzmo Discord. (He notes that the $1 trillion figure was chosen simply because “it sounded cool.”)</p><p>The hope is that the combination of all of those elements — friends groups, community goals, a deep and growing library of games — will be what it takes for Puzzmo to go up against its entrenched competition. “Everybody who we are competing with is trying to make a crossword that has the gravitas of The <em>New York Times</em> crossword,” says Gage. “But nobody is building a community around their crossword. That is the appeal of the <em>New York Times</em> crossword — there’s community. You can do it and talk to your friends about it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Turkish air pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec has become an unlikely Olympic star after winning the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Games.
</p>
<p>
The 51-year-old won silver without any special equipment (lenses, eye covers, ear protection) and has subsequently been likened to a hitman, though he's in fact competed in every Summer Olympics since 2008.
</p>
<p>
His seeming nonchalance has been compared online to South Korean markswoman Kim Yeji, who also won silver in her event and has won over fans for just being impeccably cool.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, both sporting heroes have become the subject of video game memes.

<p>
If you haven't seen the specific video, Yeji has been given "Main Character Energy" with this clip going viral, although it's actually resurfaced from the International Shooting Sport Federation World Cup in May.

Outside of video games, there are plenty of iterations of the pair as anime characters too.

All we need now is for Yeji and Dikec to be actually added to a video game. Modders, I'm looking at you.

As for video games based on the Olympics, if you're <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">missing a Mario &amp; Sonic game this year</a> it's all because the IOC is focused instead on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> and esports.

Which is good! It means the cards are cheaper to buy for those looking to complete decks, collections, or binders, and offer less motivation to grubby scalpers who try to rip the former off. Shrouded Fable—a so-called “special set” (which mainly means you can’t buy them in single packs)—is yet again jam-packed with gorgeous cards, but with the rather peculiar detail that they make up a third of the set.<br></p><p>With only 99 cards total, this is the smallest set TPCi has released since 2022's <em>Pokémon GO</em> crossover. Compare it to the last special set, January’s Paldean Fates, and there’s a whopping 146 fewer cards to collect.</p><figure id="" data-id="1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-recommend-id="image://1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-recommend-id="image://1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, based on my admittedly very small sample size (The Pokémon Company International sent us a total of 20 packs in various collection boxes and an Elite Trainer Box), the pull rates are not good at all. Out of all the packs, I pulled a total of <em>three</em> special art cards. Added to that are a further three basic ex cards (two of them the same), one Ace Spec, and three holo Energy cards, reminiscent of those found in Crown Zenith. But given how common we know those to be, if my sample is representative, that means those chasing any of the excellent 35 special art cards are going to have a rough time.<br></p><p>This has an odd effect, because if a third of all possible cards are rare as elephant wings, and ten of the remaining 64 are rarer types too, then you’re going to see half of the very small number of cards over, and over, and over, and over again. After opening just 20 packs, we had an average of four of every regular card, with three cards appearing a ridiculous <em>seven </em>times. Which led to the packs incredibly quickly feeling almost identical.</p><p>However, there <em>is</em> an upside to this for those who are building decks. For instance, Shrouded Fable sees the resurgence of the mighty Kingdra, since the splendid Astral Radiance full-art Kingdra went out of rotation in April this year. That ruined one of my favorite decks, but the new Kingdra ex brings an improved version of its ludicrously powerful stacking attack, and the six Seadra and three Horsea I pulled mean I can start building a new version immediately.</p><p>From today, you can buy Shrouded Fable in a lovely four-pack Kingambit box (the Kingambit art is wonderful), a three-pack blister with a Pecharunt card, one of five different two-pack tins, or a two-pack blister with a wholly unwanted Espathra card. (They are trying to push that hated monster <em>so</em> hard!) There is then some confusion about the availability of the five-pack Kingra and Greninja boxes, and indeed the Elite Trainer Box, which is officially listed as releasing on August 23, but with some sites and stores listing it as available now. We’ve asked TPCi for more details.</p><p><strong>Updated: 08/02/2024, 10:07 a.m. ET: </strong>Pokémon have got back to us to say that the Elite Trainer Box is indeed on sale now. The mystery of why the official site has the Pokémon Center version listed for late August remains!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
