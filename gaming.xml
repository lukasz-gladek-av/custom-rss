<p>Can you hear me now?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameChat had proven to be, well, not <em>massively</em> popular with the Nintendo Life community in the run up to the Switch 2 launch. Many had simply refused to participate in the new feature, while others were keen, yet understandably sceptical about the whole idea.</p>
<p>Yet now that it's here, it's safe to say that we, and indeed many of you, are slowly coming around to GameChat. It's basically just voice chat for online play on the Switch 2, which many consoles have featured for years by this point, but as usual, it's been done 'The Nintendo Way'. Which basically means it's ridiculously simple to set up and also weirdly charming in practice.</p>
<p>To discuss things a bit further, Alex and Felix have got together via – you guessed it – GameChat to talk all things GameChat. The duo test out the microphone's capabilities when moving away from the Switch 2 itself, along with how things hold up during a Knockout Tour race in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>So if you're on the fence about getting the camera in particular, then be sure to check out the video at your leisure. But do give GameChat a shot either way; we reckon you'll find it to be surprisingly useful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A short video clip from the single-player campaign for the next mainline entry in the Battlefield series has been pulled from the files of the latest Battlefield Labs update, with dataminer <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">Temporyal discovering and posting the clip to X</a>.</p>
<p>The footage is clearly still a work-in-progress which Temporyal points out, and they also clarify that this is not a clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-battlefield-6-gameplay-has-leaked-with-over-90-minutes-of-ps5-gameplay-online/">gameplay from a playtest</a> or the<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-showcased-in-new-leaked-video/"> Battlefield Labs test</a> like we've seen with other leaks, but just a video file, which also explains why the footage lacks the watermarks that usually accompany your screen if you've ever participated in a closed playtest.</p>
<p>According to Temporyal, the clip "<em>shows the explosive finale of a mission to destroy a dam in Tajikistan</em>." Temporyal <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">also reveals that, based on their findings</a>, the campaign will be eight missions long, nine including a prologue, taking players to locations like Tajikistan, Egypt, the USA, and Gibraltar.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release for the next Battlefield game, and we don't even know what it's officially called. According to EA, we should know at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">one of those two things soon</a>, with a summer reveal currently set to happen at some unknown point in time from now until September, to be generous.</p>
<p>For all we've seen of the next Battlefield game through leaked footage like this, there's still a lot to be revealed. These leaks are useful to get a sense of what's to come, but they're never the full picture, and there's a lot riding on this next Battlefield game. It's no secret that EA is in need of a big win.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA canceled its Black Panther game,</a> shutting down the studio it had created to make that specific game and laying everyone off. It canceled another incubation project at Respawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off more staff across Respawn</a> and other parts of the company. And at the beginning of the year, EA<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> laid off developers at BioWare</a> following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and its disappointing sales, which reached only half of what EA's top brass had expected.</p>
<p>A report recently dug into everything that happened with The Veilguard's development, and how mismanagement by those <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">same leaders at EA plagued the game from the beginning of its development journey</a>.</p>
<p>Add all the layoffs, internal issues, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">the sunsetting of hybrid work and a return-to-office call</a>, and game cancellations together, and add to that the fact that the latest entry in the company's biggest sports series <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/electronic-arts-says-dragon-age-and-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-as-it-revises-its-financial-outlook-downward/">underperformed last year</a>, and it doesn't paint a picture of a company that's all flowers and rainbows.</p>
<p>EA needs Battlefield to do well to potentially be a turning point for the company. When the full reveal comes this summer, depending on players reactions to the game, we'll see which way things are beginning to turn.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-3-adds-new-dungeons-and-more-in-august.1224105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed roughly when you can expect&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.3 to land, as well as what it'll bring to the long-running MMORPG when it arrives.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1936032284802793652" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X, Patch 7.3 will arrive in early August, and it'll continue the story of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's Patch 7.2</a>. As part of that story continuation, you can look forward to a new dungeon by the name of the Meso Terminal, which will serve as a "glittering monument to Alexandria's eternal queen".</p>

<p>The new update will also continue the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, the second part of which will be called "San d'Oria: The Second Walk". Presumably, you'll be exploring the city of the same name from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>, although given that these raids often take players through some weird and wonderful setpieces, that may not be where you end up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.3-san-doria.jpg?itok=VYYE7Ya3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.3-san-doria.jpg?itok=hikfdVUh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.3 launches in August, and it brings a new 24-person raid with it.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new story dungeon, you can also expect a brand new Treasure Dungeon to explore in the form of Vault Oneiron, which promises brand new rewards to collect as well.</p>

<p>The Cosmic Exploration feature, which is open to crafting and gathering professions, will expand in the new update as well, giving you a whole new planet to discover in the form of Phaenna. Who knows what you'll find for your Hand or Land journey there?</p>

<p>A new Deep Dungeon, Pilgrim's Traverse, will also be available, so if you prefer to take on combat-oriented challenges rather than crafting (or if you're planning to do both), you'll probably want to tackle that one as well.</p>

<p>If you play as a Hrothgar or a Viera, you'll be pleased to know there are also new headgear options available for these races, so your fashion options will be expanded when August rolls around.</p>

In between fusing demons and fighting you can easily pile on the hours throughout the game.

So be prepared to spend a lot of time fusing all of the demons!</p><p>There are also two new difficulty modes.

But while this tutorial-focused title should’ve probably just been included with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may still be worth buying for certain folks who will benefit from learning more about their new system. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Whether you’re a long-time gamer or new to the hobby, you’re probably curious about how long <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> will take to beat and whether it’s even worth that price tag. Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="h129212"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, and is it worth buying?</h2><p>Alright, let’s get real for a second. Much of <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> is just reading and following prompts or engaging in simplistic mini-games, so it’s more of an interactive exhibit than a game you “beat.” But if your goal is to check off plenty of tutorial segments and get some of the medals in the mini-games, <strong>you’ll be able to squeeze a few hours of fun out of this strange little game</strong>.</p><p>For the $10 price tag, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> provides a pretty solid look at all of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features. There’s a whole lot of useful stuff you can learn here, and it’s delivered in a bright and colorful package that certainly feels very “Nintendo” in design. But at the end of the day, it’s a glorified tutorial, meaning that its worth will be largely determined by whether you feel like you need help learning how everything works.</p><p>With this in mind, gaming enthusiasts who likely knew how every feature works on the Switch 2 before they even got their hands on one aren’t likely to benefit greatly from the information in <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>—though it’s worth noting that some of the mini-games can be fun. Younger or less experienced players may enjoy learning how to make the most of their new hardware, especially things like Joy-Con functionality and attachment, or even general safety.</p><p>We don’t want kids trying to eat the Joy-Cons, after all. They taste terrible anyway. Or so I hear. I wouldn’t know, of course. Can we move on?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line is that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would have made a great pack-in title, but it still may be worth the $10 for particular demographics. So, just make your decision based on your gaming experience and whether you enjoy quirky mini-games. As for me, I think I’ll be ripping some <em>Mario Kart World</em> instead.</p><p>If <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> sounds like a worthwhile purchase for you, it’s available now exclusively for, well, Nintendo Switch 2. It’s literally in the name. Don’t be weird.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/possessors-gives-you-demon-magic-legs-and-plenty-of-fast-action-to-enjoy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wield a computer mouse like a whip.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since developer Heart Machine burst onto the scene with its hyper-stylized 2D action game Hyper Light Drifter, every effort from the studio comes with the promise of visual splendor and tight gameplay, and Possessor(s) is no different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Hyper Light Drifter is Zelda-like, then Possessor(s) is the team’s take on the Metroidvania. Although their dev team will probably get mad at me for calling it that, as they prefer the original genre term of “search-action.” Regardless of which label you prefer, you’ll find the genre’s familiar hallmarks here. Possessor(s) drops you in a big open map full of powerful demon enemies and branching paths that aren’t all open to you just yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Heart Machine’s past games with stylized, but masked or hooded, heroes, Possessor(s) is led by a cast of beautifully hand-drawn characters whose stories I’m curious to learn more of. Set in a fictional, Japan-inspired, city, the player controls Luca, who survives a devastating, apocalyptic event. But only just barely. She awakens to find herself without her legs, which were damaged during the attack. Luckily (or not), she makes contact with a demon named Rehm, who offers her the classic devil’s bargain. She can get her legs back, but only if she helps him get revenge on some unnamed but powerful demonic forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, Possessor(s) feels heavily inspired by urban fantasy anime. Shows like Jujutsu Kaisen come quickly to mind as Luca and Rehm explore a ruined metropolitan city and fight off demon-possessed everyday objects like haunted searchlights and demon fridges. This extends to Luca as well. While she’s now powered by demon-magic legs, her weapons are also everyday objects. Things like kitchen knives or even a computer mouse she can wield like a whip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this combines into a fast-paced action-adventure. Combat feels rapid-fast, which is great because there are a lot of enemies to cut through. And running through the devastated city, or jumping and grappling over obstacles, also feels fast and great, which is a plus because I get the sense this is a pretty big game. The portion of the map I played already felt quite large and I only played a 20-minute demo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Possessor(s) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> Mechanically, I wouldn’t say Possessor(s) upends the search-action genre, or at the very least not in the early portion of the game I saw. But both narratively and in the design there’s tons more that I’m interested in learning more of. Possessor(s) has moments where the camera pans out into the ruined city, highlighting a cinematic sense of scale that Heart Machine has explored before in games like Solar Ash. And even in my short hands-on time there was a lot of dialogue and exposition between Luca and Rehm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also likely more to the RPG element that I haven’t discovered yet. Luca’s character menu seemed to show empty slots for a variety of weapons and upgrades – way more than the couple I found during my demo. And having only been given a glimpse of the map, which was primarily a lot of abandoned and destroyed office buildings, there’s clearly a lot more under the hood in Possessor(s) than what I saw. I’ll be keeping an eye on this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Lies of P patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing bug fixes as well as some major changes that make it easier to access the Overture DLC from the second playthrough.</p>
<p>The 1.9.0.0 patch changes how the Overture DLC is accessed from the second playthrough. Instead of essentially having to play through the vast majority of the game again, players can now access the DLC campaign from Chapter 5 at the "Path of the Pilgrim." The patch also introduces some difficulty changes, reducing monster difficulty in repeat playthroughs and adjusting stats for certain regular monsters in the first playthrough of the Overture DLC.</p>
<p>Besides making these changes, the Lies of P new patch addresses a variety of bugs, including issues that prevented benefit items from being properly delivered, some progression blockers, and more. The full patch notes can be found<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776?l=english"> here.</a></p>
<p>The difficulty changes introduced by the Lies of P 1.9.0.0 patch are personally quite welcome, as I found the difficulty of regular enemies a bit overtuned during my first playthrough of the Overture DLC. Thankfully, it was easy to look past balancing issues, as the expansion is just as good as the main campaign, if not even more, for those interested in the game's setting and lore who wanted to learn more about it, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p>Lies of P is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4, the latest update for HoYoverse's turn-based gacha RPG, launches early next month, the developer and publisher has announced.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 3.4, also known as "For the Sun Is Set to Die", arrives on July 2nd. Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">May's Version 3.3</a>, the new update will see you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Phainon "at the crossroads of destiny" in order to "take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova".</p>

<p>Since this is a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update, you can, of course, also look forward to brand new characters, and this time around, you're getting three, although two of them are guests from another franchise altogether.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.4-phainon.jpg?itok=BXCfkQTw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.4-phainon.jpg?itok=LiySLaWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Phainon is joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4.</figcaption></figure><p>The first new character joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 is Phainon, who can essentially take over the battlefield when he transforms into his Ultimate form. As you can probably imagine, he's a pretty reliable damage-dealer, so take him if you need some destruction in your lineup.</p>

<p>Your other two characters in this update are both visitors from the&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night&nbsp;</em>franchise, namely Archer and Saber. Archer will be available for free once the crossover event begins, as will Saber. The latter will be a five-star fighter as well, so she'll be a valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>This update will also bring reruns for&nbsp;Tribbie, Sunday, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy" rel="nofollow">Sparkle</a>, while in the second half, you'll get another chance to add&nbsp;Firefly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-teases-new-character-jingliu-ahead-of-14-ps5-release" rel="nofollow">Jingliu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-showcases-its-edgiest-character-blade-launches-flappy-birds-clone" rel="nofollow">Blade</a> to your team.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 right here. It gives a flavor of what you'll be doing when you begin your adventure next month.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 lands on July 2nd across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all platforms</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices running both major operating systems.</p>

Then, out of nowhere, the studio dropped its toughest boss yet: the Everdark Sovereign variant of Gaping Jaw. “He just don’t stop chompin,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1leyvuy/he_just_dont_stop_chompin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1leyvuy/he_just_dont_stop_chompin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one fan on Reddit. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,195502,196773" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Gaping Jaw was one of the Nightlords that caused players trouble around launch last month, in part because his weakness was poison and poison weapons can be hard to come by. He actually ended up being one of the easier boss fights for my squad, thanks in part to multiple ranged weapons forcing him to spit out teammates anytime he gobbled them up and started crunching. The new Everdark Sovereign version, however, takes the encounter to 11 the entire time. </p><p>He almost never stops moving, constantly shooting out lightning blasts and ground AOE bursts. At one point he summons a giant whirlwind storm, and players have to use jumping pads to hop over top if they don’t want to immediately get downed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-combat-radar<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> will include an optional combat radar, following intense pleas from the community.</p>
<p>In a lengthy social media thread by Randy Pitchford, the Gearbox CEO broke down the thought process behind the navigation and combat design in Borderlands 4, concluding the thread by revealing the team managed to add in a combat radar last week.</p>
<p>Pitchford wrote: "The feature will be *off* by default at launch. And, it didn't come on-line early enough to make it into our branch for the build we're bringing to the Borderlands Fan Fest this weekend. But it is now officially in the game!".</p>

<p>Pitchford elaborated: "This happened because of the best elements of our community. I'm talking about the real fans who sincerely want the best for the game and gave constructive notes and made reasonable arguments. You know who you are and you rock! You made this happen!".</p>
<p>The whole thread is worth reading for those interested in the game design process. It offers a lot of insight into the thought process behind the new movement and navigation mechanics, the costs of adding a combat radar to Borderlands 4, and how a recent press tour provided feedback that ultimately convinced the developers a combat radar would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins added their own thoughts on the reveal, noting: "Props to Jason Brown, Justin Dooley, and Ray Peña who went incredibly fast when I told them - 'If we're doing this, I want it for launch.' This is just how committed we are here guys; we're doing everything to make BL4 the definitive Borderlands."</p>
<p>A combat radar was an ever-present feature of previous installments in the Borderlands series, and offered quick and reliable information as to where immediate dangers were at any one time. This wouldn't be a huge deal at first, but as you proceeded to more challenging content it became vastly more important.</p>
<p>As such, its absence <em>was</em> noteworthy. In response to this news Borderlands fans celebrated on social media, with user furt1v3ly writing: "Oh heck yeah. I didn't need the mini-map but that radar beats the compass system hands-down. And being able to turn it off for screenshots or for extra frame rate should be a bigger win. This is the best choice."</p>
<p>It's a moment of good PR for Gearbox, at a time when it's sorely needed. Gearbox recently revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">$70 retail price of Borderlands 4, which Pitchford was publically "stoked" about</a>. This came after Pitchford stated on social media that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">"real fans" would get a copy regardless of its price</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 1 Game Cases" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ed1c42242f520/switch-1-game-cases.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's always been a little bit of contention over the design of physical game cases and their box art on Switch consoles, with most of the hate pointed towards the rather ugly way that the spines can sometimes present unevenly whilst sat on shelving, and at the printed disclaimers that take up some premium space on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> cases in particular.</p>
<p>For those who have an issue, for whatever reason, there's now another avenue to walk(man) down when it comes to displaying your precious physical games. Indeed, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/607422/switch-2-cassette-case-how-to-make-cover-art-spine">as reported by Polygon</a>, some clever persons have been creating very funky-looking cassette case covers which you can actually purchase online, should you like the look of them.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchSpines/">u/SwitchSpines</a>, one creator by the name of Eridyon has been showing off cassette case designs that they've made and they've got us coming over all Art Attack, in honesty. We're feeling a little bit Neil Buchanan all of a sudden. Yes, as you can see, some of these case designs are really slick, and what's more, they're smaller, so you can have more of them, meaning more games. Or at least that's what this writer shall be telling his wife.</p>
<p>Speaking to Polygon, Eridyon said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This originally started as a way for me to display my digital indie games that never got physical releases, and I have always wanted to be a cover art designer, but had never done any graphic design work before...I loved designing them that it quickly went to making a goal for making a case for all of my games!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, according to Eridyon, they have over 600 Switch games and they'd actually shelved doing the designs. With the arrival of Switch 2, though, this creator is back to making them with gusto.</p>
<p>In order to make your own cases, well, you can simply jump onto any online retailer (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleevie-Wonder-Cassette-Tape-Cases/dp/B0CQRZJ98B?tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon's got them)</a>, to pick up some cheap empty cassette cases firstly. Then you'll need a 3D Printer, but only if you insist on having <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6144618">the snug little cart holder</a> to place on the inside of your cases. Otherwise, it's a pack of empty cases and your imagination (or the work of somebody else - with permission, of course), printed out and stuck in for display.</p>

<p>There's a whole bunch of very cool designs over at the Switch Spines subreddit, too, so make sure to check them out for inspiration if you fancy any of this. It's also just a very good stop for getting lots of handy info on how to make, design, or simply just download some new art or ideas, with some users even providing templates.</p>
<p>Once you've done all this, make sure to send us in a picture too, and any we show on the site will get a Blue Peter bagd...oh wait, sorry, we're having a flashback to the '90s here. Must be all this cassette patter.</p>

                <p>In early 2023, Wizards of the Coast canceled at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">five video games that were in development</a>, including an unfinished Dungeons &amp; Dragons open-world action RPG by Hidden Path Entertainment. Now, nearly eight minutes of footage from that game have been leaked online, and while the title was far from finished, it shows real promise.</p><p>The footage originated from one of the music supervisors of the game (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>), which was known internally as Project Dante. Given the source of the video, it shouldn't be surprising that it puts a spotlight on some of the game's music. The video notes that the score was composed to seamlessly flow from the open-world theme to more specific tracks, including an ethereal theme for a temple and more forbidding notes as the heroes approached a Troll cave. A band of bards even performs an entire song while the main characters listen.</p><p>Project Dante's world looks enticing even in this early state, but the combat was clearly a work-in-progress at the time that this footage was made. There's enough here to see that this game had real potential, but it's never going to officially see the light of day. Some Project Dante's concept art has also been shared on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZCdr9WI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Imgur</a> as another glimpse of what could have been.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/" data-ref-id="1100-6531973">a new single-player D&amp;D game</a> in development by Giant Skull, a studio founded by Respawn veteran Stig Asmussen.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-terraria-update-arrives-next-week-new-animated-trailer-released.1223958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has revealed when we can expect the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover to land, and we're just a few days away from the creature-collecting survival game's first ever collaboration.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect&nbsp;the appropriately-named "Tides of Terraria" update to arrive on June 25th, and it sounds like you can look forward to a new dungeon to explore, new enemies to fight, and perhaps even some sweet gear to net yourself.</p>

<p>According to Pocketpair, the <i>Terraria&nbsp;</i>bosses Eye of Cthulhu and Moon Lord will both be appearing in the crossover as well, so if you haven't had your fill of fighting those enemies in&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>, you're in luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=oYBA9FKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=Va1ltcsk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>update lands next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">all the way back in November</a>, so Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>studio Re-Logic have been cooking this one up for quite some time.</p>

<p>It'll serve as&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first crossover, but it likely won't be the game's last; in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025" rel="nofollow">released in January</a>, Pocketpair teased "game collaborations (including&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>)", which would indicate that more crossovers are on the way later down the line.</p>

<p>For now, though, you'll have to content yourself with this one, as well as all the other stuff&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>has going on. Back in March, for instance, Pocketpair released an update for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">introduced crossplay</a>, allowing you to team up with your friends to take on challenges and raise Pals (or exploit them, if such is your wont).</p>

<p>It's not all fun and games, though. In May, it was revealed that some of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">mechanics have changed</a> because of an ongoing lawsuit brought against the game and its developer by Nintendo. As you've probably guessed, the lawsuit alleges legally spurious similarities between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>




<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>collaboration launches on June 26th. You can check the former out right now (albeit in Early Access) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

		<p><em>Most of Remap, aka everyone not named Janet, is a little on the older side. We have to pick our battles when it comes to games we play, especially games we finish. I mean, who could possibly finish Despelote? </em></p><p><em>But in all seriousness, even when our jobs demand us to play games in unorthodox and rushed ways, the reality is that if our jobs were to disappear overnight, we'd probably still have many of the same struggles.</em></p><p><em>Patrick decided to return to a spring favorite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and found the experience to be a combination of frustration, excitement, and clarity. Plus, he asks Rob if he's broken any bones. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> A few times over this past year, Rob, I’ve noticed myself spending 10-15 hours with a video game, yapping on the podcast about the great time I’m having, and then moving onto the next one. While it’s true that our jobs require and reward spending a little time with a game instead of a lot, it’s not as though I don’t have any free time to spend as I please. I could have kept playing <em>Avowed</em> if I wanted, I could have found time for more <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Those are both games that I would have said, in reductive terms, I’m enjoying 8/10. That’s enough to spend more time, to see what else might be hiding in the world. To have enough conversation for a podcast requires far less than 15 hours, yet I put that and more into both.</p><p>It would be say I’ll find time for them again later this year, but in reality, I probably won’t.</p><p>The game I refuse to let this happen to, however, is <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. I dropped 20 hours into that one by the time I allowed its grip on me to release, freeing me to try games like <em>Deliver at all Costs </em>and <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em>, but <em>Clair Obscur </em>was different. <em>Clair Obscur</em> was not an 8/10 that I could see myself spending more time with, it was 10/10. <em>Special</em>.</p><p>A few nights back, I booted up <em>Deliver at All Costs</em>, which—look, brief tangent. You cannot predict where the story goes in that game. It has so much story. It has so much story! At a certain point, it seems to forget that its core appeal is being a fun physics-driven driving game! It leaves all that behind to tell, of all things, a sci-fi story! Even though I’ve spoiled that bit for you, there is no chance you have any idea where that story tries to go before the credits begin to roll!</p><p>Anyway, I’m not sure if I’m endorsing that people play that game. But I’m glad I did.</p><p>The point is that credits rolled way faster than I was expecting, leaving me with an hour to play something else. We’d just recorded the podcast, so it was a moment to indulge my own whims, so why not return to <em>Clair Obscur</em>? Well, because that means returning to a video game with some pretty damn intricate systems while being more than a month removed from using them.</p><p>When I shattered my collarbone, I entered physical therapy a few months later. The therapist asked me to lie down and try to lift some small weights. They warned that lifting weights with my previously injured arm would be difficult—but it’s normal. 20lb weight? Couldn’t move it. 10lb weight? Couldn’t budge it. 5lb weight? Buddy, I’m staring at this thing trying to use the Force and nothing’s happening. My atrophy was bad but, again, still normal. It took months of hard, annoying work to get things back into shape. You know, much like grinding one does in a JRPG.</p><p>I knew I wanted to love <em>Clair Obscur </em>again, but it also meant putting in <em>work</em> to love <em>Clair Obscur</em> again. Where was I at in the story? What style of play was I leaning into with this character? Rather than worry about all that, I just started playing. I barely knew what I was doing, but in time, memory matched reality. I haven’t found the enthusiasm to dip into the most annoying parts of that game, aka the equipping and unequipping of skills, but I’ll get there.</p><p>The nice part is knowing it’ll be worth it. Janet’s finished the game and is ready to scream about it from the top of a mountain. Our tastes are basically aligned, which helps give me the motivation, much like a physical therapist, to put in the time and <em>work</em> to get back into things.</p><p>Still, it’s weird to view this as “work.” How have you handled similar situations?</p><p>P.S. My five-year-old broke her arm last week. Have you broken anything before?&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@harlsta?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Harlie Raethel</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Broken anything? No. But I tore my ACL playing football in high school. We were doing a tackle drill, third practice of the day, everyone was tired. I was sluggish and didn’t get as low as I should have to absorb the hit, the guy tackling me didn’t really use any form he just kind of hurled himself at my shoulders. If I hadn’t been wearing such nice new cleats I might have been fine, but my lower left leg stayed planted while the rest of me arced down to the left from my waist. The pain was instant and unlike anything I’d experienced before. For a beat, I couldn’t see. Was literally blinded for a long second or two, probably just from complete sensory overload.</p><p>It was a stupid way to get hurt, though there are times I also wonder how many programs are still doing full contact practices for six or seven hours a day. I was in the absolute best shape of my life at that moment, the guy who hit me was also in terrific shape. We were just tired because it was the final twenty minutes of our third practice of the day.</p>

They’re all word games, presumably launching now to try to keep some momentum after the magazine lucked out in March of this year by having its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, added to a group chat in which the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/hegseth-senate-hearing-los-angeles-troop-deployment&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/hegseth-senate-hearing-los-angeles-troop-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still-in-his-job</a></span> Pete Hegseth was sharing top-secret attack plans.</p><figure id="" data-id="1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-recommend-id="image://1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="976" data-height="549" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Atlantic's promo image for its new games." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Atlantic's promo image for its new games." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Atlantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-recommend-id="image://1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="976" data-height="549" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Atlantic's promo image for its new games." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now it seems that online encyclopedia (and one of humanity’s most extraordinary achievements) Wikipedia is getting in on the action. Yesterday, when having coffee with a friend, I opened the app to try to remember what it was that the director of the extraordinary sci-fi film <em>Primer</em> had done that meant he wouldn’t be working again. (Accrued repeated accusations of domestic violence, if you’re wondering.) But before I could, I was asked by Wikipedia if I would like to play a game. Um, sure! So my chum and I were entirely sidetracked into playing <em>Which Came First</em>, an incredibly simple concept in which the app gives two short descriptions of historical events, plus sometimes a small picture clue, and asks you which happened first. That’s it. It’s great!</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Which came first?</p><p>Deputies of the French Third Estate take the Tennis Court Oath.</p><p>The U.S. vessel SS Savannah arrives at Liverpool, United Kingdom. It is the first steam-propelled vessel to cross the Atlantic, although most of the journey is made under sail.</p></blockquote><p>That’s the first question of today’s edition. I haven’t the faintest idea! I didn’t have a clue about any of the five questions yesterday, either. My historical knowledge is, without question, <em>atrocious</em>. Thankfully, Paul’s a far more rounded, smarter man than me, and was able to make educated or even informed guesses, and “we” got four out of five! Woo!</p><p>OK, so obviously this isn’t the most groundbreaking of puzzle ideas. But actually, it’s a perfect addition to Wikipedia, because it’s entirely about <em>finding out something new</em>. I may be sitting here wondering literally which century we’re in with that above question, but I’m also dying to know more about the “Tennis Court Oath” now! It’s also wild to realize that the United States Congress adopted the Great Seal around the same era King Louis XVI was trying to flee the French Revolution. I mean, you may say “Duh,” and deeply worry about the standard of British education in the ‘80s and ‘90s, and you’d likely be right to. If my dad were alive to hear my ignorance, he’d be immediately dead again. But, and this is a lifelong philosophy of mine, you never mock someone for not knowing something if they’re willing to learn it <em>now</em>.</p><p>And, with respect to that, Wikipedia’s little game offers direct routes toward some knowledge. At the end of the five questions you’re given your score and streak as you’d expect, but also a nicely presented list of all the articles relevant to the questions you were asked, and indeed dictionary definitions for specific words and terms. Today’s has an excellent 34 boxes to click on for more information, as general as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holocaust</a></span>” and as specific as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kazimierz Piechowski</a></span>.” And indeed, I’m pleased to say, a tile for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennis Court Oath</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wikimedia Foundation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When trying to find out more information about Wikipedia’s game, not least whether I’m embarrassingly late to discovering it or one of the first to be offered it, I find there’s the weirdest lack of information out there.

In fact, the game’s own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/TriviaGame&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/TriviaGame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“more info” link</a></span> goes to an empty page! (I have, of course, reached out to Wikipedia to ask all about it.) However, I <em>have</em> discovered that it began on May 20, 2025, because that’s how far back the archive of daily games goes. So a month today! Hopefully you can now find it yourself by opening the updated version of the Wikipedia app on your phone. And hopefully it’ll catch on and become a whole section within the app.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following a recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> previews, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that one fan-requested feature will be in the game when it launches in September. While a mini-map won't be in the looter-shooter, a radar will, making situational awareness of a battlefield much easier.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935803698976022970" rel="nofollow ">In a lengthy thread</a>, Pitchford spoke about how fans had been asking Gearbox to add this feature to the game--many people from the European, US, and Asian preview tours were advocating for it, Pitchford said--and the studio managed to make this happen.</p><p>"As me and head of dev, Steve Jones--and some of the other guys--were poking around with producers trying to figure out what it would take to add these features and if we could make it in time to ship or not, something awesome happened," Pitchford explained. "In classic Gearbox style, where we have an ethos of 'they who builds it, wins,' some developers got together and found some time in the margins of their schedules. Some Gearbox heroes did what Gearbox heroes do!"</p><p>Several Gearbox employees "splintered off" to work on the radar, and Pitchford says they managed to squeeze it into the game before it undergoes some QA testing ahead of its launch. The radar will be off by default when the game launches, and it won't be in the current build of Borderlands 4 on the Borderlands Fan Fest showfloor this weekend. Here's what it looks like in action:</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">Borderlands 4 will also have a few other fan-requested features when it launches</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/">base version of the game has an MSRP of $70</a>. "This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving at a later date.</p>
