            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://defector.com/why-your-team-sucks-2025-baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> haven’t had a great season so far in the NFL. Their current record is an abysmal 1-5, tied for the team’s worst in 30 years. And a new report claims the team’s coach, John Harbaugh, is understandably not happy about this and has removed many fun items from the locker room, including the team’s video games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/">On October 20, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em></a> reported that after going 1-3 and a player posting a photo of them playing games to social media, team officials and Harbaugh removed several “recreational staples” from the Ravens’ locker room. These included a basketball hoop, a ping pong table, a few corn hole boards, and some “video game consoles.”</p>

 <p>The report doesn’t specify which consoles, but it does mention that the team often played “intense rounds” of<em> Super Smash Bros</em>, so I’d assume some Switch or Switch 2 systems were removed. The outlet also says that these <em>Super Smash</em> sessions drew “small crowds of teammates late in the day.”</p> <p>Ravens players told <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> that the football team’s coaching staff wanted to “remove distractions” and help players focus more on playing, practicing, and, I assume, eventually winning. This isn’t the first time the team has done this, either. In past seasons when the team struggled to win, so-called “locker room freedoms” and benefits were scaled back or removed entirely. For players who need a break from having to focus and work all day, that can be tough. After all the fun toys and consoles were removed, the team lost two more games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/">a blog post</a> thanking everyone who participated in last weekend’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">super fun Server Slam</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ developer Embark Studios commented on a few topics of note, three of which address some changes the team is making in light of the experiences folks shared online.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Those who played during the Server Slam and previous technical tests have raised a number of questions and concerns, mostly over the fine edges of what is shaping up to be one of the best and most approachable extraction shooter experiences yet. So let’s get into some of what Embark is looking to fix, and some fun data points from the test over the weekend.</p>

 <h2>Flying Arc are getting a gentle nerf</h2> <p>Let’s jump straight into the most consequential change Embark is looking to make for launch: The flying Arc drones are too damn perceptive. While many people, including myself, felt that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">dealing with our robot overlords</a> above Speranza was appropriately challenging, those damn drones were quick to find and harass enemy players. Embark is changing that. In the post the studio said:</p>

 <p>It turns out their <b>awareness was a bit too high</b>, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</p> <p>As a multiplayer game, I’ve no doubt this isn’t the end of difficulty tweaks for <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But preserving the tension and difficulty of the game is important. I mean, Leapers need to be able to scare the shit out of us, as one does to some hapless players in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes_were_made/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this absolutely hilarious clip</a>.</p>

    <p>That said, diminishing just how quickly a drone can catch sight of you sounds like a reasonable adjustment.</p>

   <h2>Fairness adjustments</h2> <p>Embark is also making it a little tougher to get into the Dam Control Tower on the Dam Battlegrounds map. Seeing so many players easily access it during the Server Slam “was fun to watch,” the post says, “but [it’s] a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That’s been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.” That <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odcjy5/good_or_bad_change/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sounds like a wise change</a>.</p>

 <p>On a similar topic, it will be interesting to observe how the devs respond to the various ways players end up using in-game gadgets. There’s a fine line between an OP tactic and, well, griefing. While it doesn’t sound like there were too many abusive uses of gear during the Server Slam, one technique comes to mind as a possible indicator of things that might become controversial: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obv44e/barricading_the_tower_zipline/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Placing a barricade in front of a zipline</a>.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of vertical and horizontal ziplines all over the map, and if you place a barricade in front of one, it blocks an approaching player with sometimes hilarious results; watch the video above to see a downed player get stuck at the top of the barricade. I’ve seen other players just fall to their deaths with this. Is it fair? Is it ripe for toxic abuse? The devs will no doubt have a lot of interesting decisions to make in the future.</p> <h2>Addressing the “graphical downgrade”</h2> <p>Though it may have been the first time for some, the Server Slam wasn’t the first chance folks had gotten to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>. There have been two previous technical tests and during those, it seems the game had some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oagvwj/dear_embark_please_explain_or_undo_this_graphical/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more visual spectacle</a>, a discrepancy some players noted.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ocnp9m/devs_respond_to_graphics_downgrade_just_make_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Embark has replied</a> to this concern, stating that it had “done optimization to ensure higher and more stable framerates on low and mid spec hardware.” As someone with a temperamental PC, I really appreciated how smooth the game ran. But the game does <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ociyyf/dear_embark_studios_please_dont_forget_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">look notably fancier in previous builds</a>. Embark says it will try to find the “right balance” to this discrepancy. And players have another concern regarding the graphics: Foliage.</p>

 <p>On lower graphical settings, the dense bushes that are perfect for hiding just vanish. It brings up a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odehgm/petition_to_remove_low_foliagegraphics_settings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">serious concern about fairness</a>. If I can just turn my graphics settings to low, then I can see anyone hiding in the bushes. It’s an odd situation in which having a lower-end machine could mean an advantage over someone cranking their RTX 5090.</p> <h2>800k ducks and everyone’s favorite single-shot menace of a rifle</h2> <p>Embark shared a number of fun stats from the Server Slam, including which Arc was deadliest (obviously it was the Rocketeer. Somehow, though, ya’ll took down 77 Queens. I only faced it once, and that was because some genius in my party said “Let’s go take the Harvester!” and I couldn’t muster an “Are you nuts?” in response.</p>

 <p>That “77” number is put into perspective when you realize that collectively, we destroyed 58 million other machines. Yeah.</p>  <p>Also, the Ferro, the game’s single-shot gun that melts shields, was the most-crafted weapon and it sounds like rubber ducks were among the most commonly found treasures in the Rust Belt.</p>   <p>Honestly, I can’t wait for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ release. One more week, ya’ll. Drink some water and spend time with your loved ones while you still can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-copilot-installing-automatically-on-windows-11-pcs-now-trains-microsofts-models-on-users-pc-gameplay.1332163/">user on ResetEra spotted</a> that as part of their network traffic, Microsoft's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Gaming Copilot AI</a>, which is automatically installed on Windows 11 PCs, was sending screenshots and captures of everything they were playing back to Microsoft, so Microsoft could use that data to train its AI models further. The setting is on by default, which means that unless you turn it off, Microsoft is using your gaming time to train its AI.</p>



<p>Wccftech can confirm that when you navigate to Game Bar, and then to Settings, and Privacy Settings, the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "<em>Model training on text</em>" is defaulted to being activated. I found the setting activated on my own laptop, before turning it off.</p>



<p>There's also options for Gaming Copilot to train using any vocal conversations you have while playing games, though that was not defaulted to being 'on,' when we looked at our settings. It'll also capture personalization and memory data, and of course, keep track of any conversations you have with Gaming Copilot, if you were actually using the service.</p>



<p>You can turn all of these settings off and/or ensure they're off by going into Game Bar, then to Gaming Copilot, then the Settings gear, which should be in the bottom left corner, and then lastly Privacy settings. There, you'll be able to turn off, or at least knowingly opt in to letting Gaming Copilot train on your gameplay, instead of it being on by default.</p>



<p>In the past month or so, Microsoft has done nothing, it seems, but be a public disappointment for players. The price of the Xbox Series consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">went up in the US for the second time this year</a>, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">a price hike for Xbox development kits</a>, meaning even game devs have to pay more for Xbox hardware. The price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass went up 50%</a>, while at the same time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">reward programs</a> for Xbox software and services were shut down. And in the midst of all of that, we can probably expect a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-preparing-free-ad-supported-version-xbox-cloud-gaming/">version of Cloud Gaming with ads</a>. </p>



<p>Now, the latest is that Microsoft is training its AI with your gameplay, almost definitely without you strictly knowing about it.</p>



<p>None of it exactly endears Xbox and Microsoft to players, but it does at least seem par for the course for a company that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">laid off 9,000+ people to bet more on AI.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-september-2025-sales-borderlands-4-final-fantasy-tactics-2000638319</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-seems-to-have-sold-just-fine-despite-reactionary-boycott.1332190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was the fourth best-selling game in the U.S. for September with just three days out on the market, according to the latest figures from Circana. Sony’s latest open-world blockbuster appears to be doing just fine despite an attempted boycott by online grifters and their followers.</p> <p>“With one week in market, the US sales performance of<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was basically flat to that of <em>Ghost of Tsushima,” </em>the research firm’s Mat Piscatella wrote on Bluesky. “It did great. <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> launched in July 2020 (if you’ll recall, stuff was happening at the time that significantly boosted gaming), and the PS4 installed base at the time was significantly higher than the PS5 is today. Like, anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye.”</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was behind <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>NBA 2K26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26</em>, which isn’t surprising considering those are multiplatform best-sellers and the samurai revenge tale remains exclusive to PS5 right now. Sales were still enough to make <em>Yotei</em> the 18th best-seller of the year so far by revenue and the second best-selling game on PlayStation during the period, just behind <em>NBA 2K26</em> but ahead of <em>Borderlands 4</em> which had two additional weeks on the market.</p>   <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has been on the receiving end of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">slow-burn reactionary backlash</a> from online culture warriors ever since it revealed its protagonist was a woman named Atsu. She’s played by Erika Ishii who was attacked by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">usual suspects</a> for being queer and for posting about about defunding the police during the 2020 George Floyd protests. The flame war intensified after a Sucker Punch developer posted a joke about the Charlie Kirk assassination, with some calling for a boycott of <em>Yotei</em> even after the developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290">was fired for the remark</a>.&nbsp;Boycott or no, it seems to have had little meaningful impact on <em>Yotei</em>‘s trajectory, at least at launch.</p>

 <h2>Is<em> Borderlands 4</em> still a sales juggernaut?</h2> <p>The September sales figures have some other interesting nuggets to chew on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> posted some impressive Ws but with a few major caveats. It was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month and instantly hit number three for the entire year, with 30 percent higher dollar sales at launch than <em>Borderlands 3</em>. But <em>Borderlands 3</em> was $60 instead of $70, didn’t have a Super Deluxe Edition selling for $130, and wasn’t initially available on Steam, where <em>Borderlands 4</em> appears to have sold a good portion of its copies.</p>

 <p>2K Games hasn’t released any official sales figures yet. <em>Borderlands 3</em> sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1kns4wo/borderlands_3_is_2ks_fastest_selling_title_with/">over 22 million copies and before that, <em>Borderlands 2</em> hit 30 million</a>. My guess is that<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a return to form hampered somewhat by PC issues at launch, ends up tracking somewhere in-between.</p>

 <p>In other news, the PS5 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">already outsold</a> the entire PS3 generation in under five years. It has a couple of years left to beat the PS4 globally. I don’t think anyone’s ever beating the PS2. Not even the Nintendo Switch.</p> <p>But my favorite sales data point of all from last month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a>. It came in ninth overall, and second on Switch, which is extra impressive when you remember it’s selling for only $50. Square Enix hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">a possible sequel</a> if it does well enough, or at least more strategy RPGs. I’m buying everyone I know a copy for Christmas.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Hope My Outer Worlds 2 Companions Really Do Try To Kill Me]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-companion-list-faction-loyalty-2000638303</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-hope-my-outer-worlds-2-companions-really-do-try-to-kill-me.1332157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companions in the original <em>Outer Worlds</em> were kind of stiff. You could build up your relationships with them. They’d tell you when they were unhappy. But none of it ever led anywhere. They amounted to a fire-suppressing peanut gallery that helped you learn about and reflect on the world around you but little more. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will try to fix that. You still can’t romance companions in the sequel but at least they’ll try to kill you this time if you really piss them off.</p> <p>You’ll have six optional companions in Obsidian’s upcoming sci-fi RPG, many associated with particular in-game factions. Niles is an engineer from the Earth Directorate. Valerie is a robot from the same faction. Aza is a cultist from the Glorious Dawn. Inez is a field medic from Auntie’s Choice. Marisol is an assassin from the Order of the Ascendant. Finally there’s Tristan from the Protectorate who has a giant hammer. Hurt their friends or break their rules and they’ll turn on you.</p>

 <p>“One of the things that was really important is we wanted these characters to feel like they’re their own people,” design director Matt Singh said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s">latest episode</a> of the Xbox Expansion Pass show (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player’s aligning with them, that’s great. They’re going to be there for you. They’ll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they’re going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict, that might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they’ll be there for you in the end.”</p>

 <p>This sounds neat and builds off one of the most memorable moments from the original <em>Mass Effect</em> in which two of your squadmates clash, resulting in an unreconcilable showdown. Over a decade later I still remember what choice I made during that part of the game and why (fuck you, Ashley). I don’t expect <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> to rise to the same level since these confrontations don’t sound like pivotal scripted moments so much as procedural consequences.</p>

 <p>Singh also suggests you can sort of skate by the friction if you have a good enough relationship with the NPC. Something like, “Uh, sorry I wiped out your clan, remember that time I finished your second loyalty mission though?” I hope that’s not the case. I hope we have some real friends-to-enemies journeys out there in Halcyon this time around. One of my biggest complaints with party-based RPGs is that the people you’re with never seem to quite have a mind of their own outside of sassy retorts and disappointed scowls. It sounds like <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is trying to evolve the formula beyond that.</p> <p><b>“</b>We still wanted to make sure that the player has choice<span>—</span>meaningful choice—here,” Singh <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/18764-the-outer-worlds-2-interview-talking-role-playing-second-chances-with-obsidians-brandon-adler-matthew-singh">told <em>RPGSite</em> in another interview</a>. “Companions are completely optional. If you don’t want to engage with them, you don’t have to. But you can take them along and see how that changes your story. Same thing with factions, right? The factions are there. They have their goals. They have their motivations. You can try to side with them. You can try to bring them together. Or you can say, ‘F it. I’m going my way. I don’t care about you. We’re going to do it the way that I would like.’ We’re all trying to figure out how to give the player as much player agency as possible and respond to it in interesting ways.”</p>

It is a wildly popular board game. It has sold over 45 million copies, is currently up to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sixth edition</a>, as well as artisanal, bespoke game piece collections such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a>.</p>

<p>That straightforward set-up will be the focus of these adaptations. Settlers on the fictional island of Catan navigating landscapes, shifting alliances, managing their limited resources, and dealing with robbers and bandits.</p>

<p>The producers for these projects will include Vertigo Entertainment's Roy Lee, Catan Studio's Pete Fenlon, Asmodee's Darren Kyman, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Millions of people are enjoying CATAN since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming. I am thrilled to see the game expanding to a larger audience who will discover the richness of its universe, I find it exciting for the future of the brand.” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of asmodee. “It’s also a testament that board gaming is truly part of pop culture and a popular form of entertainment in everyone’s homes, and I am delighted to continue asmodee’s relationship with Netflix.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Anyone who has played CATAN knows that the intense strategy at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,” said Jinny Howe, Head of Scripted Series, US and Canada, Netflix. “We're thrilled to partner across series, features, animation, and games to bring this world to life for hardcore 'Settlers' and new fans alike.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>The Netflix <em>Catan</em> announcement seems to be part of the trend of modern Hollywood leveraging recognizable IP for content. This has included turning the board game Clue into a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">competitive game show</a>, and feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">film adaptations</a> of Wizards of the Coast's popular card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>

<p>This also isn't the first time one of Asmodee's board games got a Netflix adaptation. As part of their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-gets-into-movies-with-radar-films" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021 deal</a> with Radar Films, the movie <em>Family Pack</em> released on Netflix in 2024. This adaptation of <em>The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em> currently sits at a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow">38% rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has no business being as funny as it is. Whether I’m enjoying the absurdity of its main cast’s antics or passing by an NPC who says something so out of pocket I have to do a double take at their speech bubble, I’m getting plenty of chuckles out of my time in Lumiose City. The citizens of the Paris-inspired setting seem to be </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-secret-npc-dialogue-sinister/"><span>going through it</span></a><span>, and it means that you’ll find a lot of odd one-liners popping up as you run through the city.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There’s much to be said about whether or not Lumiose City feels “alive” in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>small map’s</span></a><span> lack of distinct districts and visual identity has come under fire since the RPG launched last week. Still, you can’t deny that its people have character. The main cast of Z-A Royale participants and members of Team MZ are some of the most memorable characters Game Freak has put in one of these games. While the nameless denizens of Lumiose City you encounter aren’t decked out in glitz and glamour like the members of the main cast, they make the most of their screentime, like that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/30/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-got-upstaged-by-a-swivel-eyed-extra"><span>one lady in the background of </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the brief quips you’ll see while running around actually drop surprisingly insightful tidbits, like revealing what’s happened to characters from </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Others are just the ramblings of mad people at their wits’ end, who can’t be bothered to mask their discontent in front of a group of young adults tirelessly trying to save the city. Without further ado, here are some of the best, funniest, and most unsettling quotes I’ve seen both online and in my own playthrough.</span></p>

While the actual writing and artist selection happened on the Wizards side, we had a ton of input and chances to provide feedback and went through multiple rounds making sure everyone was happy with the overall look and mechanics for the cards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the ways Wizards and Sucker Punch helped bring Jin Sakai to Magic: The Gathering was to lean into the duality of his fighting styles in Ghost of Tsushima, where he’s torn between samurai combat and the stealthier ‘Ghost’ path.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jin Sakai is about a warrior torn between two identities — the honorable samurai and the shadowy Ghost,” Connell explains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"From the start, I wanted to capture two ways of approaching encounters in Ghost of Tsushima..." - Annie Sardelis, WOTC</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wizards of the Coast did a great job capturing this in the card with the Standoff ability, which represents his swordsmanship, while Ghost highlights his stealth and ability to strike fear into his opponents. The rest of the Secret Lair cards that Wizards of The Coast curated for this drop helped show his journey to support that theme: tools of conflict, sacrifice, and shifting control that echo Jin’s struggle between tradition and survival."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the start, I wanted to capture two ways of approaching encounters in Ghost of Tsushima," explains WOTC Senior Game Designer, Annie Sardelis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I combined elements of how Magic has classically expressed a lone fighter's skills by only giving that bonus to a single attacker. Since double strike and "can't be blocked" are phrases we've seen time and again on Magic cards, I added the words to help my coworkers become familiar with what I was going for. Flavor words, like flavor text, can help give creative definition to rules text, and we ended up keeping them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A PlayStation Pantheon</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/magic-the-gathering-playstation-secret-lair-superdrop-1758926000898.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair x PlayStation Superdrop.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just last week, TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/13/of-ash-and-steel-will-launch-on-november-6th/">Of Ash and Steel would launch on November 6th,</a> but what a difference a week makes. However, after some more testing the development team has discovered some issues that need additional work, so Of Ash and Steel will not make the November 6th date as planned. The delay is not too long though, with Fire &amp; Frost confirming that the new date is now November 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the team wrote, <em>“Right now, we are in the active phase of testing the game before its release, making sure your journey across the island will be as smooth and bug-free as possible. Originally, we announced that your adventure would begin on November 6. However, during testing, our teams discovered several issues that require more time to fix than we initially expected. We’ll need a few extra weeks to properly address these issues. The new release date for Of Ash and Steel is now November 24th, 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Announcing the release date was one of the most exciting and nerve-wracking moments of development, because deep down we feared something like this might happen at the very last moment. And… it did! Hopefully, you haven’t booked your vacation around the release just yet. We sincerely apologize for this short delay, and hope you’ll understand our decision. Finally, for those who haven’t tried the demo yet — good news! It will remain available for a while longer, so you still have time to step onto Grayshaft and experience the first hours of your adventure. Thank you for your support, and we’ll see you (just a little later) on Grayshaft!”</em></p>

<p>Steam Next Fest was a success for Of Ash and Steel with the demo being one of the best performing demos, and the game has now been wishlishted over 220,000 times. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance. The demo features part of the main quest, side missions, professions, and upgrades.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-creepiest-entry-yet-not-in-a-good-way</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-is-the-creepiest-entry-yet-not-in-a-good-way.1332085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f7323ddf36ebf"><a title="Legends Z-A 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f7323ddf36ebf/legends-z-a-1.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>There’s been quite a lot of talk recently about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-is-it-about-time-game-freak-added-voice-acting-to-pokemon">lack of voiceover work</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and I can understand why. Game Freak has made some pretty decent strides with its cutscenes, depicting characters that animate realistically right down to their facial expressions and mouth movements. Yet they don’t actually talk. It’s weird in practice to see such well-constructed scenes play out in near total silence, but that’s actually not my biggest gripe with the residents of Lumiose City.</p>
<p>If you go into a real-life busy city centre in the middle of the day, one thing you’ll notice is that most people will probably be walking somewhere. Whether they’re darting from shop to shop, slowly ambling along in chattering groups, or even taking a few steps backwards to pick up the sausage that’s slipped out of their hotdog bun, everybody’s moving. Heck, it’s the reason why cities are often described as ‘bustling’ – it literally means ‘full of activity’.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kjlnzg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Not in Lumiose City, though, oh no. You take a stroll through Legend: Z-A’s environment, and you’d be forgiven for thinking Medusa had run amok and turned almost everybody to stone. They just stand still, and it’s <em>so</em> <em>creepy</em>, man.</p>
<figure data-uuid="02291a5c99b34"><a title="Legends Z-A 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02291a5c99b34/legends-z-a-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Erm... Hello? Anybody alive? — <em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I want to acknowledge right off the bat that this isn’t a new thing; NPCs have always been averse to movement in Pokémon games. But there’s just something about Z-A that makes it more noticeable than ever. My theory is that because Lumiose City is the only major environment, anything that detracts from its sense of place is immediately more glaring. You could almost forgive previous entries for similar infractions because their towns and cities were simply part of a much larger world. Here, the city <em>is</em> the world.</p>
<p>There are so many people, too. I’ve honestly never seen a wider selection of NPCs in a Pokémon game, and the fact that 99% of them stand completely still makes for some seriously weird, unsettling imagery. They're not just on pavements too, but in the roads, sitting down for a sip of coffee (not actually drinking though), or standing on the grass, facing in seemingly random directions. It’s like that scene from M. Night Shyamalan’s cult classic <strong>The Happening</strong> where everyone suddenly stops dead in the middle of the street (I’m joking about the ‘cult classic’ bit – it’s a stinker).</p>
<p>I know everyone’s made a big fuss about the buildings in Z-A, and I get it, they’re pretty awful. But in my opinion, you can get away with quite a lot if you actually make it seem like your environment is busy with activity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADY4LTn7TNA">Go back to the first 3D GTA games</a> if you don’t believe me. The cities there may look pretty crude by today’s standards, but of the few pedestrians and vehicles that those games are able to handle in one go, the majority of them are moving in some way. It makes a huge difference.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e2f97d24045ec"><a title="Legends Z-A 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2f97d24045ec/legends-z-a-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Let's just ignore that sadist on the right, hm? — <em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not just an aesthetic thing, either. One of the biggest mechanics introduced in Z-A is the ability to sneak up on your fellow trainers and land a move on their Pokémon before they’ve even had a chance to respond. So if I can do that, why can’t they? It would make navigating the Battle Zones so much more interesting and engaging if I knew that an NPC could get the drop on me at any moment. It’s yet another indication that in the world of Pokémon, you’re the hero, and everyone else is just surface dressing.</p>
<p>I’m not completely down on Legends: Z-A. I think the overall structure of having specific zones for catching and battling is quite interesting, and the character customisation is frankly the best it's ever been. But man, I’m so tired of these games feeling so lifeless all the time. Its environments are supposed to convey a sense of excitement and positivity, and I just feel like I’ve been plunged into the middle of a horror movie.</p>
<p>I don't know... Maybe I've been spoiled by games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Or maybe Game Freak needs to get a grip and start making its worlds feel a bit more alive. It's not much to ask, right?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Am I crazy in thinking this, or do you agree? Should more NPCs in Pokémon games actually start moving and living their lives, or are you happy for them to just stand around and wait for you to interact with them? Let me know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a>, a duck-filled top-down PvE play on Escape From Tarkov, has had a stunning commercial launch with more than 1 million copies sold in its first five days, developer Team Soda and publisher Bilibili Game have announced.</p>



<p>This duck-focused game arrived on Steam almost exactly a month ahead of Escape From Tarkov's Steam arrival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/">which is currently set for November 15</a>. Escape From Duckov arrived on October 16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Mac App Store.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Soda is incredibly humbled to have reached such heights, and we owe this success to an incredible community of players and our friends at BiliBili Game</em>," said Jeff Chen, producer on Escape From Duckov at Team Soda. "<em>Whether you have been with us through our early days promoting the demo on Steam or are just joining to see what all the quacking is about, thank you.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of this writing, Escape From Duckov is one of the trending games on Steam, and one of the most played games right now, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/">per SteamDB</a>. Once Escape From Tarkov is out on Steam next month, it'll be interesting to see how both games fare.</p>



<p>Of course, they serve different audiences. No one is looking to Escape From Duckov for the kind of experience that Escape From Tarkov delivers. Still, it'll be fun to see if the parody is ever able to surpass the concurrent player count of the original, once we can see their numbers on a somewhat even footing, since there will surely still be plenty of Tarkov players who don't use the Steam version to launch the game. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today’s NYT Connections puzzle is a mighty forgiving one, but that doesn’t mean you don’t still want some handy hints to make things <strong>even easier</strong>. It’s almost the weekend, and, understandably, you might want to give your brain a bit of a rest today.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions for you below, so that you can get the fastest answers possible for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #865:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>FINE</li>



<li>PRIZE</li>



<li>SWAG</li>



<li>STONE</li>



<li>KITTY</li>



<li>BALL</li>



<li>DUCKY</li>



<li>BIRDIE</li>



<li>GO</li>



<li>SWELL</li>



<li>PURSE</li>



<li>MIXED</li>



<li>POT</li>



<li>PUCK</li>



<li>DANDY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe things going delightfully well, in a retro kind of way.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these can refer to a collection of winnings, often in games or competitions.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll find one of these in curling, another in badminton, and the rest in other Olympic sports.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes a common phrase ending in “bag.” Think dogs, surprises, and party favors.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 23.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>

<p>But it came out in October!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="b1abdb464219d"><a title="Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1abdb464219d/galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We knew <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> for the Switch would be popular, but according to the latest figures from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvn5ljlo25">Circana's Mat Piscatella</a>, the game topped the best-selling titles on Nintendo platforms in September.</p>
<p>Wait a minute... September? But it launched on 2nd October, right? Yes, that's right. But according to Piscatella's accompanying chart, the data is recorded from 31st August 2025 to 4th October 2025, so Galaxy and Galaxy 2 fell just within the relevant time period.</p>

<p>Looking at the new releases specifically, we've got the aforementioned Galaxy and Galaxy 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a>. Nintendo's re-release managed to beat all of them, and this is even considering the fact that Nintendo doesn't share digital data, so this was achieved through boxed sales alone.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890kznmhg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>A good result, then, despite some vocal backlash online. It's Mario, y'know? It'll be interesting to see where things stand next time, but we're fully expecting Pokémon Legends: Z-A to top the charts for the month of October.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-ubisoft-layoffs-this-time-at-massive-entertainment.1332040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Ubisoft RedLynx put out a statement today</a> that it was laying off up to 60 members of its staff in a restructuring to focus on "<em>small screens</em>," one of the teams that you could argue is one of Ubisoft's jewel studios for the Snowdrop Engine alone, Ubisoft Massive Entertainment, <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732">released a statement confirming its own restructuring,</a> and that it has launched "<em>a voluntary career transition program</em>," which is essentially giving employees a chance to take themselves off the board while still receiving proper severance and support.</p>



<p>"<em>As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,</em>" the statement begins.</p>



<p>"<em>To support this transition responsibly, we have introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.</em>"</p>



<p>The statement concludes with Massive Entertainment reiterating it is "<em>fully committed to our roadmap and to creating</em> <em>great experiences for players around the world, including The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Massive Entertainment's recent titles, both Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws failed to hit the mark for Ubisoft on a critical and commercial level, what can't be denied is that the studio's Snowdrop Engine is technically impressive, because if nothing else, both Outlaws and Frontiers of Pandora are two of the best-looking games this generation.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate to see more layoffs from Ubisoft today, even when Ubisoft tries to wrap them up in a bow by framing it as employees taking "<em>their next career step on their own terms</em>." Sure, those "<em>eligible</em>" employees might ultimately choose to leave, but being told you're eligible to leave is another way of saying you're no longer wanted. </p>



<p>Beyond the layoffs announced at Ubisoft RedLynx, we've also seen Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">push out veteran developer Marc-Alexis Côté</a>, who until recently was the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise for the company.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator 2 Review - Suds Up!]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-review-suds-up.1332037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Powerwashers, it's time to suit up, as the citizens of Caldera County require your cleaning expertise once again for ample soapy adventures. Developer FuturLab <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">returns with <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></a>, the direct sequel to their 2021 bubbly simulation game, bringing forth new jobs to take on, more equipment to acquire, and new interiors and exteriors in need of a clean.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review" rel="nofollow">the release of <em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a>, FuturLab laid out the blueprint for its sequel, which should make way for a host of new content to explore and new adjustments and optimizations for a more squeaky-clean gameplay. As for whether <em>Powerwash Simulator 2</em> sets itself apart from its predecessor or is more of the same, it's up to the players to decide, but what they can anticipate is plenty of time spent blasting the dirt away, as we did!</p>

<h2>Time For A Spring Clean</h2>

<p>Let's be honest, as it pertains to the previous sentence: FuturLab doesn't do much to innovate the formula they have set out with <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>in 2021 by comparison. Instead, the developers set out to build upon their sudsy creation by improving the game's graphics and controls, retooling its tools and equipment, and better structuring their maps for a smooth gameplay experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-907.jpg?itok=WnVpJauq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-907.jpg?itok=1AFCp2Ro 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We have a powerwashing office building to conduct our cleaning business.&nbsp;(Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the owner of a powerwashing company in Caldera County, players will lend their hand to fellow residents through various jobs they'll undertake by cleaning multiple objects and buildings from a shooting gallery, a road sweeper, a few houses, and yes, even a public toilet. Luckily, they'll have a few things to help them on these jobs to make accessibility more seamless and guide them in completing them for their clients.</p>

<p>There's also a story in play whose foundations were laid in the first game, with an Ancient Statue, and it continues in its sequel, as it has some paranormal origins. Players will gain insight into this mystery through character dialogue in text messages and article clippings, which will help them piece it together.</p>

<h2>"Boom And The Dirt Is Gone"</h2>

<p>Admittedly, every player will have a method for cleaning objects and structures in <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, and mine was to clean from top to bottom and in a clockwise direction, for my OCD's sake. While my approach may be rather meticulous, perhaps bordering on obsessive, cleaning, or in this case, power washing, is cathartic and helps unwind or unpack the mind.</p>

<p>As relaxing as it is to blast away the dirt from the rooftops to the walls and on the ground, from a gameplay perspective, the maps that feature in every story job that players will undertake have been structured similarly to the first game, where, upon accepting a job, players blast away the dirt and grime from all surfaces. However, there are a few areas that are rather tricky to clean, like between joints, handles, drains, and the underside of vehicles, which will demand plenty of time for players to get clean.</p>

<p>While as frustrating as it may be when trying to determine which areas were amiss, a tracker can be accessed where players can mark which areas have not been thoroughly cleaned. Likewise, hitting a button or key can reveal the remaining dirt spots or unclean areas before aiming our power washer tool to wash the dirt away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-878.jpg?itok=0iqyAD0_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-878.jpg?itok=5Gy4XDqO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't mind us. We're just cleaning the side body of the Airship's gondola. (Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, buildings and other structures will be a much easier feat to accomplish, especially when utilizing various equipment pieces, such as jumping atop platforms, climbing ladders, and the new scissor lift, to reach and clean the rooftops, thus making our time on the job well spent. For floors and rooftops, perhaps the most useful tool of them all, the SwirlForce Surf Ace surface cleaner and its attachments ensure that the surfaces are cleaned extremely well and in a quicker time, too.</p>

<p>Although players will have to spend their hard-earned money to splash on the SwirlForce Surf Ace surface cleaner and other cleaners with their attachments over time, players can find their favorite tools of the trade. The tool wheel allows players to access all acquired cleaners and their attachments to find the best tool for the job or for the task at hand, whether it be for flat surfaces or cleaning the tricky nooks and crannies.</p>

<p>On the latter, not every job will go smoothly, as there will be some challenging jobs to tackle, like the shooting gallery, a literal billboard, a cement truck, and a shopping mall, which will throw players for a loop. While the task at hand may be daunting, having a plan of action and the right tools will make these jobs less intimidating while cleaning these precarious surfaces less arduous.</p>

<p>Despite the frustrations one may have with these complicated surfaces, which can be time-consuming, there is fun to be had, such as on the billboard map, where players can use a new piece of equipment, the abseiling apparatus. While high up in the sky, players can move up and down and left to right while being seated; however, the only restriction is that trying to clean the platform below will force you to disembark, so it's slightly limiting in its utility.</p>

<p>One of the welcoming changes to the washers and their attachments is that once they've surpassed their functionality, they can be sold, which wasn't possible in the first game. This, in turn, will allow players to recover funds to purchase more effective and powerful washers for more challenging jobs as they progress in the story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-905.jpg?itok=UBBTPbvJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-905.jpg?itok=2hwYKR_5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players can customize their office building by purchasing furniture pieces from the in-game shop! (Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another new change, or rather addition, is customization according to the sequel's story, and the expansion of their cleaning business; they'll move into new premises that can be personalized. You reorganize the shop where players can purchase furniture, which must also be cleaned before using the Placement Mode to reposition and place them within their business space.</p>

<p>And for the best possible experience, players have the option to choose between Classic and Modern controls, which have just a few differences between them, but for experienced washers, the Classic controls will be more akin to their experiences with the first <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> game. Likewise, the Free Play and split-screen co-op modes return, allowing players to revisit completed maps and team up with another player for the ultimate couch co-op experience.</p>

<h2>Not Entirely Spotless...</h2>

<p>One desire for the sequel was to up the ante, but unfortunately, it follows the same formula as the first game, and its gameplay can feel repetitive at times, almost in a loop of doing the same things over and over again. While it stays true to its formula and boasts a few new additions along with new adjustments and optimizations that change the formula ever so slightly, <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is more of a continuation of the first game rather than a sequel.</p>

<p>Mind you, there are some long-awaited adjustments and optimizations, such as soap retooling, reselling of washers and attachments, new tools and equipment, improved controls and graphics, alongside the new maps and customization, gameplay is much the same. Yes, it's very much <em>PowerWash Simulator,</em> but with a fresh coat of paint, it's still plenty of fun engaging with the content, blasting all the dirt and grime off surfaces, and having a variety of tools at our disposal.</p>

<p>Sure, the details are in the small things that give <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> quite the upgrade from its predecessor. The developer didn't do much to evolve the game completely, but they have done enough to make it a standout release in the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> series. And players won't be disappointed with this latest offering, with plenty of new content and a host of changes that will keep them engulfed in bubbly fun for hours on end.</p>

<h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-904.jpg?itok=pZTs6w_8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-904.jpg?itok=GKXSgMSu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players can replay their favorite jobs in Free Play mode when accessing the Mementos Shelf.&nbsp;(Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>With tens of hours invested in <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, one will certainly continue their soapy adventures and expand their powerwashing business in Caldera County. Having spent hours and hours in the first game and enjoying all the DLCs that were added post-launch, suffice to say, that there is an excitement towards the sequel, and I was genuinely surprised with what the developers offered in the sequel, even if it doesn't appear to be a sequel in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Quite simply, FuturLab took the formula and the best parts from the first game, adding much-needed new content, adjustments, and optimizations for a more complete power-washing experience. What many are most looking forward to once they've rolled the credits is whether they'll follow a similar post-launch roadmap in adding free and paid content to the game in the form of DLCs, adding more variety to the game, and continued investment from the players.</p>

<p>It will certainly be interesting to see where <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> will be in the future, both short-term and long-term, and if the developers are following the success story of its predecessor. The future is undoubtedly bright and bubbly. Now, if only a particular achievement didn't get bugged, preventing me from unlocking it, but for once, we'll blame the gnomes for this!</p>

Borderlands 4 launched at $69.99 (eventually, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">a weird kerfuffle online about whether it would jump to $80</a>), with the Deluxe Edition priced $99.99 and the Super Deluxe Edition at $129.99. At its launch in September 2019, Borderlands 3 cost $59.99 for the standard edition, $79.99 for the Deluxe Edition, and $99.99 for the Super Deluxe Edition. It's also worth noting that Borderlands 3 was a PC exclusive to the Epic Games Store for six months after its release, whereas Borderlands 4 launched across PC via Steam as well as consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we don’t have hard sales figures yet (2K Games has made no announcement so far).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/bonsaidiorama/2025.10.07_BonsaiDioramaDemo_NvRTX_5.6.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downloadable 'Bonsai Diorama' demo</a> that shows off DLSS 4, path tracing, and RTX Mega Geometry. The Bonsai Diorama demo accompanies the latest update of the Unreal Engine RTX branch (version 5.6.1), showcasing RTX Mega Geometry alongside ReSTIR PT (which just received performance and image quality improvements) and the full DLSS 4 technology suite (DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLSS Frame Generation).</p>



<p>If you wish to try the demo, NVIDIA says the minimum graphics card is a GeForce RTX 2080Ti, while the recommended one is the GeForce RTX 5060. Also, you should be using the GeForce driver 581.29 or newer.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also warns that the resolution and window settings can only be adjusted in the main menu, before actually launching into the Bonsai Diorama demo level. You should start the demo with full screen; if using an 8 GB GPU, start with 1080p or 1440p. If you use an 11 GB GPU or higher, try 4K resolution.</p>



<p>Once in the demo, you can toggle the user interface by pressing H. Here, you can toggle RTX Mega Geometry and Ray Reconstruction on and off and tweak DLSS Super Resolution (Off, DLAA, Auto, Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance) and Frame Generation (Off, Auto, 2x, 3x, 4x). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The main feature being showcased here is really RTX Mega Geometry, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted in Remedy's Alan Wake 2 with a patch showing performance improvements</a>. In this case, though, NVIDIA focuses on the image quality benefits:</p>



<p><em>RTX Mega Geometry adds full quality Nanite geometry to the ray tracing bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). As a result, ray traced shadows and reflections no longer exhibit visual artifacts typically present with Unreal Engine 5's default behavior.</em></p>

<p>A webinar is <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/experience/elitenvidiabrill/1407606/3849291/level-up-with-nvidia?linkId=100000374605923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled</a> for Thursday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time. Developers will be able to ask questions about the Bonsai Diorama demo and its featured technologies.</p>



<p>In other NVIDIA news, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) can now use the open-source Qwen3-8B AI model as an In-Game Inferencing (IGI) SDK plug-in. This simplifies integration within a developer's pipeline and optimizes the simultaneous processing of AI and graphics for accelerated game performance. Qwen3 enables developers to create enhanced game characters that can reason in real time through non-scripted events and respond dynamically to player inputs and contextual information.</p>



<p>Alongside the release of Qwen3-8B, NVIDIA also made several improvements to the core IGI SDK:</p>



<ul>
<li>MultiLORA adapters to quickly fine-tune model weights with minimal computational overhead</li>



<li>CUDA support for graphics with Vulkan backends, which optimizes graphics and AI workloads for accelerated performance when both are running simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-season-1-preview-phase-1-begins-october-28</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-preview-california-dreaming.1332013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em> out now and doing quite well for itself in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" rel="nofollow">multiplayer</a> action sphere – as we detailed in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale" rel="nofollow">full review</a> – it’s time to turn our attention towards what’s next for EA’s biggest game of the year. We’re just under a week away from Season 1. Launching on October 28 and across three phases over time in an effort to bring high-quality content to players at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The first phase of content will open with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map known as Blackwell Fields, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint. In the second phase, starting on November 18, we’ll see California Resistance and the addition of another new map called Eastwood.</p>

<p>Then, on December 9, Winter Offensive will begin with a seasonal update to the existing Empire State map.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021181326_1.jpg?itok=6bfODZKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021181326_1.jpg?itok=9x9Lk7bZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each <em>Battlefield 6</em> season will include new weapons, maps, modes, as well as vehicles, and more. All of this content is being promised for free from the start, or is earnable on free tiers in the Battle Pass.</p>

<p>Digging into Rogue Ops specifically, it’s themed around high-stakes ops in pursuit of military secrets in the first all-new map: Blackwell Fields. While it’s a large map set in the Californian Chaparral and built for all-out warfare, there’s a good amount of structures that lean heavily into standoff with outdoor combat.</p>

<p>We got to try out this map in the Close-Quarters Battle mode, which meant smaller team sizes and up close and personal fights. Right away, it’s easy to see why this map is ideal for the selected mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can duck in and out of military installations and homesteads scattered across the land. Everything is dusty and dirty, and fires scatter the area, which makes it harder to see clearly in some aspects.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021201408_1.jpg?itok=4h8jDo8g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021201408_1.jpg?itok=Iq-2VO-3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>New weapons available during this phase include the SCAR SC .300, which excels at close-quarters combat. There’s also the Glock 22 and the Mini Fix Bolt-Action rifle for long-distance attacks.</p>

<p>There’s also a new vehicle available – an APC called the Traverser Mark 2, which operates as an Infantry Support vehicle that offers up a spawn point and a supply station or other vehicles on your team. Rogue Ops and the Blackwell Fields map will run from October 28 to November 11, with Phase 2 to follow.</p>

<p>California Resistance is an apt name for the next round of Season 1 because it further explores another area of the region where both NATO and the local militia are trying to defend California from PAX’s incursion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The map coming up here is called Eastwood, is set in a quiet and upscale Southern California neighborhood – well, formerly quiet because now there’s a warzone running through it, and every part of it can be chaotic but also used to your advantage.</p>

<p>Trying out the All-Out-Warfare mode, it’s easy to see how this area has become a complete battlefield, and you’ll be fighting in and around houses, blowing them apart, and riding around in tanks and other vehicles to add to the destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=SEcq-bGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=8AJ9J0GV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This phase will also introduce a limited-time mode to<em> Battlefield 6</em> called Sabotage, in which two teams of eight attack and defend supply caches on the map. Attackers and defenders will swap sides after each round to mix things up, and destroying the most caches will net a win for the match.</p>

<p>Battle Pickups will also debut during this phase, which are high-value, rare weapons with limited ammunition but can do major damage to enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New weapons will include the DP-12 shotgun, which has different ammo types in each of its tubes, and the 8-shot S&amp;W M327 revolver.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the season will turn towards winter, and while details remain sparse for now, it’ll launch ahead of the holidays with a winter-themed Empire State map. Following that, players can expect Season 2 to drop within the new year.</p>

            <p>
You might be currently wondering where the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is, seeing as it hasn't turned up yet, and to explain its absence developer Arrowhead have taken to the game's Witter account with a post going into some details about it. Apparently it was originally planned for Tuesday, i.e. yesterday, October 21st, but a "last-minute certification issue caused a delay."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the studio is currently aiming for a release by the end of the week, with "staff ready to work over the weekend if needed." On that point, hope you pay good overtime and will give said staff members time off in kind, Arrowhead! However, you also shouldn't hold them to it, as they also say there's a chance the issue won't be fixed by this Friday, meaning the patch could be delayed even further into next week. "We’re doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding," explains Arrowhead.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Freedoms greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We want to share an update on our most recent patch. It was originally planned for Tuesday, but a last-minute certification issue caused a delay.

<p>
The post goes on to note how Arrowhead has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">pushed back things like Warbonds</a> to focus fixing up performance, and outlined some of the optimisations coming to the game whenever the next patch launches. This includes things like optimised status effects, physics, asset distribution and setup, VFX, and AI behaviours. 
</p>
<p>
There should also be reduced stuttering during the drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds, improved audio IO performance and general performance. Generally sounds like it'll be a good patch for smoothing over some of its current snaggly bits. You just have to wait a bit longer for it!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trials-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-to-lose-60-employees-in-layoffs-become-a-mobile-developer.1332004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft Redlynx, the developers of the Trails franchise, is set to lose up to 60 employees in the latest round of layoffs by parent company Ubisoft. </p>



<p>A statement posted on <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio’s website</a> says that Ubisoft is moving forward with a <strong>“restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company’s global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company’s worldwide studio network.”</strong></p>



<p>Redlynx says that it will negotiate with studio staff before making a decision on the proposal, which focuses “primarily” on the administration and production teams. These negotiations with the staff are scheduled to start on October 30 and will end by the end of November.</p>



<p><strong>“If materialized, this proposal would result in the reduction of maximum 60 positions,” </strong>they say.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-ubisoft-proposal-for-redlynx">What Is The Ubisoft Proposal For Redlynx?</h2>



<p>As far as what this proposal entails, it was said that Redlynx would “refocus” from being a multi-platform developer to one that’s “specialized in small screens”. </p>



<p>“This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio’s unique expertise—starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>Ubisoft RedLynx managing director Celine Pasula added that, “We are confident that, with the proposed changes, RedLynx would continue to play a meaningful role in Ubisoft’s future—driving technical excellence on mobile devices, and strengthening Ubisoft’s cross and multi-platform capabilities on small screens to expand our audience reach.”</p>



<p>The news of layoffs at Ubisoft RedLynx comes alongside the announcement that another Ubisoft studio, Massive Entertainment, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having its own wave</a> of job terminations.</p>

                <p>In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/scarface-the-world-is-yours/" data-ref-id="5000-21399">Scarface: The World is Yours</a> was released as an alternate timeline sequel to the classic 1983 film starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana. The game has been unavailable for a long time, but it's recently shown up as a pending re-release on Epic Games Store and Steam. However, no one seems to have heard of the publisher, EC Digital, and it's unclear if it's actually happening.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/a-publisher-nobodys-heard-of-has-unintentionally-re-released-2006s-scarface-the-world-is-yours-early-and-im-not-so-sure-bout-this-one-boss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Scarface: The World is Yours was accidentally released early on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, and the game page is still active. It's also listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, which included an explanation for the early release.</p><p>"Due to a technical issue during backend configuration, the game was unintentionally pushed live on a different platform earlier than planned. We want to clarify that our intended long-term release platform includes Steam, and we're now accelerating our efforts to finalize this version," the statement reads.</p><p>Because Scarface went live prematurely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m3rcc3p2ep2j" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> and others noted that it includes two fan-made patches, SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, which make the game playable. The creator of SilentPatch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cookieplmonster.bsky.social/post/3m3rcwjmhps2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Silent</a>, notes that the patches were incorporated into this release without permission, but also acknowledges that it wasn't "necessary as per the license, but would be nice."</p><p>Attempts to reach EC Digital didn't turn up any contact info, and it's unknown if Universal sanctioned this re-release. Following the initial reports, EC Digital has shared a statement on Steam that it has asked Valve to temporarily hide the page "while we worked through ongoing licensing and technical matters."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1980996726572954007" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Updated notice on Scarface on Steam <a href="https://t.co/b0KXtvOm5v" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/b0KXtvOm5v</a><br>"We’ve recently entered urgent discussions with multiple parties concerning the project’s status.

If things change and we're able to bring the game back in the future, we'll let you know right away."</p><p>For now, this doesn't appear to be going forward.

                <p>The idea of exclusive games in 2025 is "antiquated," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond. She said in a new interview that people are beginning to "evolve way past" the idea that a game should be exclusive to one store or device.</p><p>"The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox ... that's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people," she told <a href="https://youtu.be/yDmwJ7tuoD8?si=GKqqs8S6R2L7458R" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>.</p><p>"You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Rog Ally X</a>]. It just opens up another way for you to play, as does cloud, as does PC as do the consoles we all have in the living room," she added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="435">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=435" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft was once a big believer in exclusive games, but the company has updated its business strategy and has in recent times opted to release its games in more places, including rival systems.</p><p>For Sony, the company has also begun to bring more of its games to places beyond PlayStation, including PC and, in the case of Helldivers 2, Xbox. Nintendo, however, only releases its own games for its own exclusive platforms, and that's proven to be good business for the company.</p><p>Microsoft does not have one single strategy it applies to all of its game releases, as some titles are released across multiple platforms simultaneously, others are not. One of the next Xbox games that could make the jump to PlayStation is Starfield, with a report saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-wont-be-announced-until-2026-report/1100-6535565/" data-ref-id="1100-6535565">this will be announced in 2026.</a></p><p>In other news, Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">announce a Halo: Combat Evolved remake, and it might be in the works for PS5.</a></p><p>Microsoft was also in the news recently regarding Bond's comments about the next Xbox console, labeling it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/" data-ref-id="1100-6535604">"high-end"</a> and prompting fears from fans that it will be very expensive.</p>
