            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo isn’t officially at CES, but it might have stolen the show anyway: accessories-maker Genki brought a 3D-printed mockup of what it says is Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we got to hold it and take some high-resolution pictures. </p><p>Based on the mockup of what we’ll call the Switch 2, Nintendo’s next console appears to be wider than the original, with slightly larger Joy-Con controllers that seem like they’ll be more comfortable to hold. Compared to a Steam Deck OLED, the Switch 2 mockup still feels noticeably smaller, in part because the Joy-Cons are not as pronounced and ergonomic as the Deck’s grips. But the mockup still feels closer in size to Valve’s handheld than the original Switch.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><p><figcaption><em>A rough size comparison with a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As previous rumors have indicated, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons will attach to the console via magnets instead of a sliding rail, Genki cofounder and CEO Eddie Tsai tells <em>The Verge</em>. To detach a Joy-Con from the Switch 2, you press a big button at the top of the backside of each controller, Tsai says, and that button apparently pushes out a pin that nudges against the chassis of the console, disconnecting the magnets.</p><p>You can remove the Joy-Cons with brute force if you really wanted to, according to Tsai, but he says, overall, they feel secure for regular use and that the big release button detaches the Joy-Cons with ease. Tsai declined to share where he’d learned details of the new console.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</p><p><figcaption><em>The left JoyCon without pressing the detachment button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Tsai also tells <em>The Verge</em> that housed within the mounting channel of the Joy-Cons is an optical sensor, and by using another attachment the new Joy-Cons may offer mouse-like functionality. It sounds a bit like what Lenovo does <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">with its Legion Go handheld</a>.</p><p>Nintendo has promised that it will announce the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>, and as that deadline creeps closer, there have been waves of leaks and rumors about the new hardware. In December, YouTube channel SwitchUp posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video</a> showing a 3D-printed, non-functional Switch 2 mockup provided by a Chinese case manufacturer. That mockup basically looked like the current Switch but bigger, and it revealed a few other potential changes like a new USB-C port on the top of the device and a mysterious new square button under the Home button on the right Joy-Con.</p><p>Days later, accessories-maker Dbrand announced its “Killswitch 2” case, and CEO Adam Ijaz <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that it was designed based on “actual dimensions”&nbsp;based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” Ijaz also said that it was his “understanding” that the console’s Joy-Cons are magnetically attached. And Dbrand’s imagery showed that the new square button had a “C” printed on it, though Ijaz didn’t know what it was. Days after that, our colleague Sean Hollister spoke with a Redditor who shared apparent photos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">of the Switch 2’s dock</a> and the&nbsp;inside&nbsp;of what appears to be a Switch 2 Joy-Con.</p><p>With that April 2025 deadline inching closer every day, it seems like it won’t be long until Nintendo officially, finally reveals the Switch 2. But until that happens, at least we have these pictures to look at.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, The Washington Post (former employer of Nathan Grayson and me) laid off less than<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/washington-post-layoffs-1236249871/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 100 people</a> on the business side, the latest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2025/01/04/washington-post-trump-bezos-cartoonist-resigns/52d8560e-caeb-11ef-a9b8-74e0b395057f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upheaval</a> at the Jeff Bezos-owned paper that’s struggling with the unique problem of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/jeff-bezos-killed-washington-post-endorsement-of-kamala-harris-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it wants to be</a> during the upcoming Trump administration, and the much less unique problem of how to get people to pay money for journalism. Among those laid off were, reportedly, most of The Post’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-crisis-hit-washington-post-axes-dozens-in-cash-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR team</a>; a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lf6gudz25k2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> about a new PR strategy reads in part,</p><blockquote><p>Talent-driven journalism is the future of media, and personalities and creators will lead the way...</p><p>Effective immediately, we are repositioning the entire Post PR division to build and launch our Star Talent Unit. We will stop the dedicated practice of publicity for our journalism across broadcast and traditional media outlets…</p><p>The core focus of our team will be to ensure our audiences know who our journalists are and rely even more on these trusted voices... We will also be working closely with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/12/20/introducing-wp-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Ventures</a>, expanding our talent roster to include creators.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wagatwe.com/post/3lf6njrkztc2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevemullis.bsky.social/post/3lf6jir2df22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alone</a> in being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lf6hgee5tk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrified</a> by the phrase “Star Talent Unit.” While it’s not clear yet precisely what this new approach will look like, the name and the mention of "creators and personalities," alongside the intention to hire more, suggest The Post could lean in on promoting whoever it considers its biggest personalities instead of the paper’s work more holistically. On its face, such a move would make a kind of sense; I think most journalists would admit influencers and content creators are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5246011/influencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nibbling our lunch</a> when it comes to engagement and subscriber money, especially among <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/media/news-influencers-social-media-conservative-study/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">younger audiences</a>. And I think we’d all admit that borrowing some of these personalities’ promotion strategies is an <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unfortunate necessity</a> these days, especially on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of the “star reporter” is a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031975/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long</a>-<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing</a> <a href="https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Paige_Sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image</a> that’s been present in every newsroom I’ve worked at or known people who work at: your biggest names who do the site’s most high-profile work, and as such are afforded the autonomy, time, and pay (maybe– we’re still talking about journalism here) to do so. They do the kinds of stories that go wide, that audiences talk about, that can effect change in your beats. They become the people your site is known for and come to feel <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/abeewords.bsky.social/post/3lf6hopqtcs23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">essential</a> to, the people readers take to the comments section to declare a site “over” if they leave. Sometimes, especially these days, these folks strike out on their own, realizing they can use the name they’ve built in a newsroom to get paid by readers directly. Other times, an organization will bend over backwards to keep them, which may or may not go well for them and the people they work with.</p><p>I’m not going to pretend star power isn’t real: there are writers out there with unique strengths and compelling personalities and savvy self-promotion skills. When you’re an editor or team leader, as I’ve been, you don’t serve those writers, your outlet, or your audience by clipping their wings, but you have to balance that against the needs and strengths of everyone on your team, including those whose talents or interests lie in less flashy areas. I always wanted as best I could to give each of my writers the assignments they wanted and the things they’d excel at, to put them on the work that would be the best for both them and the outlet. This isn’t always possible: there are only so many of the biggest games of the year to review or events to cover; if everyone is heads-down in long-term reporting or ambitious criticism, no stories are going up while that work gets done; sometimes, there is just workaday news to write or videos to make or admin work to do, to keep your site functioning or to keep the suits above you happy about your page views or, simply, to serve your audience and keep them informed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you want to give everyone on your staff the time and opportunity to shine at what they shine at, and to acknowledge and promote that work accordingly, but I’m not sure–and I’ll regretfully include myself in this–I’ve ever seen that fully work out. Just as much as “star” reporters can elevate an outlet, they can wreak havoc inside it too. Resentments flourish; even in the most well-managed scenarios, it’s natural to be jealous of someone who you think gets more freedom and attention than you do. People can behave badly, leading to mercurial “stars” and mistreated or bitter colleagues. A “star” can, intentionally or not, claim a beat or style of work and crowd others out of it. Colleagues can feel like they have to, or be made to, pick up the slack while someone does long-term work without ever getting their own shot at it. A site can go from being a team of journalists to feeling like a “star” or two and their support staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the big stories from the big names go up, they can seem to an audience like the work of whoever is on the byline, when in reality <em>everything</em> that goes on the page is the product, to some extent, of everyone who works at an outlet. Great journalism doesn’t happen in a vacuum; colleagues talk a story over, point a reporter to sources, lend their expertise, give feedback, edit, suggest a headline, provide art. They write the day-to-day stories readers need, and those stories help keep the lights on and make the money that pays for the more ambitious work. The “star reporter” builds on the work and reputation of an outlet to do their work, from the kinds of stories they pursue to the sources who’ll be willing to talk to them. A good newsroom and its leaders acknowledge this, internally and externally, when a big story goes live. A handful of people’s names might be on the page, but that story is the work of everyone who works on that team, and everyone had some hand in its impact and success. A good leader, and a good organization, doesn’t leave those teammates behind or use them to build up other people’s names.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m saying this all from my perch at a version of the situation I’m warning against, an independent outlet built, at least in part, on name recognition and thus some version of star power. It’s likely you were willing to pay for Aftermath because you heard of the people who work here; you heard of us because an outlet and its team supported us in learning to make the work you’re paying for. You could see Aftermath and our worker-owned outlet peers as a success story of the very thing The Post could pursue, some kind of triumph of personal branding alongside the democratizing power of the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could also read it, more pessimistically but maybe more honestly, as a damning example of what it takes to still make journalism these days. Things weren’t going <em>so well </em>that the five of us and our colleagues at other outlets all decided there was a way to make them go even better; our organizations failed us, or didn’t want us anymore, and we went independent because it was that or leave the field. I’m aware, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld267tue7s2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every day</a>, that everyone can’t do that, that there’s a view of our sites that sees us building our own little islands and leaving others behind. I fully believe independent organizations like Aftermath and our peers are paving the way for democratic workplaces that live our values and prioritize our audiences. But we aren’t, or aren’t yet, a working alternative to the system crumbling around us, one that creates a reliable future for journalists and journalism as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to undertake all the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3le3qy5qyp22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnout-inducing</a> self-promotion and name recognition and cultivation of reader relationships as a survival mechanism as much as a unique strength of our space. The Post’s PR pivot has the potential to embrace the worst of that, to cut even more people out of having a satisfying, stable future in journalism by combining the harshest requirements of independent spheres with established journalism’s own worst habits of competition and “star power” myths. A focus on “star talent” wouldn’t serve those supposed “stars”--as we’ve <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-27366/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-after-rift-with-editors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already seen</a>, why would someone submit themselves to the strictures of an organization when even the organization is telling them their personal value will get them farther? And it wouldn’t serve the people who don’t get to be the “star talent,” who might feel their work is devalued or that they’re playing second fiddle to whoever the paper decides is worth promoting. And why would <em>anyone</em> in this situation put their efforts into The Post, or any outlet, as a whole, if that outlet's PR strategy promotes the opposite?</p><p>There’s no denying things both in established journalism and outside of it are bleak. It’s naive to be dedicated to an outlet that could fold or cut you at any moment, and it’s exhausting to add self-promotion to any writer’s already endless to-do list. One of the most well-resourced news organizations in the world should be looking for alternatives to how things currently stand, not just creating another version.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/open-thread-how-was-your-break"><h3>Open Thread: How Was Your Break?</h3></a><p>I did not turn off motion smoothing at my parents' house</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-hero-stats-reveal-pick-and-win-rates-in-quickplay-and-competitive-modes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">No love for Storm as players continue to flock to Jeff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games has unveiled a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hero Hot List for Marvel Rivals</a>, revealing pick and win rates for everyone from Jeff the Land Shark and Mantis to Storm and Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a straightforward list of every playable character in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days"><u>massively popular</u></a> hero shooter that gives players more insight into which Marvel icons are being picked over the others. You probably won’t be too surprised to see Jeff leading the pack as the number-one pick across PC and console quickplay games. He’s sitting at 21.18% pick rate, with Venom in second at 19.09% and Cloak &amp; Dagger in third at 18.81%. At the opposite end of the list, we find Storm, with only 1.66% of players choosing to smite opponents with her weather abilities in quickplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pick rates for competitive, meanwhile, tell a slightly different story. Pop-centric healer and Strategist Luna Snow tops the pick rate list at 20.66%, with Jeff still cracking the top 10 in seventh with 13.86%. The tough-to-handle Storm remains at the bottom in competitive games at just 0.69% on PC, while Black Widow sits in last with 0.79% in competitive console matches. It also seems that the Strategist and Vanguard roles remain equally popular among players regardless of mode or platform.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Concrete numbers for Marvel Rivals show NetEase is willing to be a bit more transparent about how fans are choosing to engage with the roster, but many will likely find little surprise in the pick rate list. Jeff, specifically, has proven to be quite the punching bag for the community since launch arrived last month. This adorable dog shark has terrorized enemy teams with his It’s Jeff! Ultimate ability, which sees him swallowing multiple enemies and, usually, sending them hurtling to their deaths. He’s relatively easy to get a handle on, so it’s never been a surprise to see him show up in a match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Win rates, on the other hand, reveal that Marvel Rivals has been a mostly even experience regardless of which hero players dive into battle with. While nearly every character hovers around a 50% win rate regardless of game mode, Jeff actually finds himself on the lower end of the spectrum at 45.39% of matches won in quickplay and 44.38% in competitive. It’s actually Mantis who brings home the most consistent victories, with 56% of games won in quickplay and 55.20% won in competitive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these stats may give players clues as to how NetEase will push forward when it comes to future balance changes. That said, those pick rates will certainly change once <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1"><u>Season 1</u></a> introduces new maps, modes, and characters, such as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image"><u>Fantastic Four</u></a>, starting this Friday, January 10.

In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about the Switch 2--or whatever the next console is called--and what's been speculated about the next system from Nintendo. There has been quite a lot of news about the next Nintendo console lately. In fact, it appears the rumor mill is really heating up of late, though this doesn't necessarily mean an official announcement is coming up soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has made multiple announcements lately, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-alarmo-alarm-clock-only-works-with-switch-2-in-our-dreams/1100-6527034/" data-ref-id="1100-6527034">alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">a music app</a>, but there hasn't been any <em>official</em> word on the Switch 2. </p><p dir="ltr">2025 kicked off with a juicy rumor, as people claim to have their hands on the Switch 2's Joy-Cons. Images posted online claiming to be the new controllers suggest they will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">sport a similar design to the original, though they could be hiding a new feature or two.</a> Another recent report detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">how many units the Switch 2 could sell in the US during its first year.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Another recent report that claimed the next Nintendo console is indeed called, simply, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-indeed-called-switch-2-report/1100-6528573/" data-ref-id="1100-6528573">Switch 2. </a>One Chinese retailer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-switch-2-accessories-are-now-available-to-buy-with-a-major-asterisk/1100-6528194/" data-ref-id="1100-6528194">selling screen protectors and carrying cases for the Switch 2</a>, and these could contain clues about the form factor and size of the Switch 2. They also might be totally fake or speculative.</p><p dir="ltr">This post covers the system's potential form factor, rumors about the the Switch 2 release date, price, launch games, backward compatibility, and more. For simplicity's sake, we'll refer to the new system as the Switch 2, although it seems likely that, based on Nintendo's history, it will have some kind of new, original name for the console. Time will tell.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of unanswered questions remaining about the Switch 2, but for now, here's all the essential information we have.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_leaked_images">Switch 2 leaked images</h2><p>A major development for the Switch 2 came in mid-September 2024 when unverified images of what's claimed to be the Nintendo Switch successor<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/" data-ref-id="1100-6526551"> appeared online</a>, revealing a console that isn't a radical departure from the current Switch console design. The images suggest that the Switch will sport a bigger eight-inch screen, Joy-Cons that use a magnetic attachment, and significantly improved hardware in comparison to the current model.</p><p>The pictures were first found on a Chinese social media site and uploaded to Reddit. While Nintendo has not commented on them, a source told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that the <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1836369796742398294" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit images line up</a> with what partners have been told to expect with the final Switch 2 design.</p><p>In November and early December 2024, the alleged Switch 2 leaked images continued to pour out, this time revealing a closer look at the reportedly updated and more ergonomically designed Joy-Cons. The images seem to show a number of updates over the existing Joy-Cons, including bigger SL/SR buttons, a pedal back button, and a more curved design, among other things.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/deckwizardyt/status/1863631563176530330" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">BREAKING: Nintendo Switch 2 Joycons Allegedly Leaked ⚠️‼️<br>✅️ Larger SL/SR Buttons<br>✅️ New Pedal Back Button<br>✅️ Curved Design<br>✅️ Resembles September 2024 Leak<br>✅️ Pics from China Factory<br>✅️ Leaked on Bilibili <a href="https://t.co/jv3LDBRu0r" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jv3LDBRu0r</a></p>  — Deck Wizard (@deckwizardyt) <a href="https://twitter.com/deckwizardyt/status/1863631563176530330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Then in January 2025, new images of the supposed Joy-Cons emerged, and, crucially, it appears the new controllers could feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">mouse functionality.</a></p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1875948187527303592" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The new Joy-con appear to have an optical sensor similar to a mouse on the side, so people are speculating now they could be used as a mouse <a href="https://t.co/mrxPvE5WPd" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/mrxPvE5WPd</a></p>  — Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1875948187527303592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 id="Switch_2_Rumored_Release_Date">Switch 2 Rumored Release Date</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't know for sure. The Switch launched in March 2017 and console generations are known to be in the area of 5-10 years, but there is no guarantee that Nintendo would follow a similar playbook with its next piece of hardware. Trends are always changing due to a variety of factors.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wii and Wii U, for example, launched in November of 2006 and 2012, but it's anyone's guess as to the launch month for the next Nintendo console.</p><p dir="ltr">A September 2024 release date for the Switch 2 emerged in an official press release from the newest interaction of GameShark. But it proved to not be legitimate. After that, an analyst suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-report/1100-6520627/" data-ref-id="1100-6520627">Switch 2 will launch in 2024 and feature and an 8-inch LCD screen</a>--but that, of course, didn't happen either. </p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, someone at the Consumer Electronics Show spoke with peripheral company Genki and was apparently informed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">Switch 2 will launch in April 2025.</a> This is not confirmed, of course. </p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch 2 will be announced during the company's current fiscal year (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025)</a>, so the official reveal could happen anytime now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">During an earnings call</a>, Furukawa alluded to what the Switch 2 might be in terms of an evolution over the first system. Several times in the briefing, Furukawa spoke about the "successor to the Nintendo Switch," suggesting that the new device will build on the foundation established by the Switch console.</p><p>"At this stage, we cannot say anything more about the successor to Nintendo Switch," Furukawa said when asked why that term was used specifically. "For today's announcement, we determined that the most appropriate expression to use was 'successor to Nintendo Switch.' Information will be released in stages leading up to the launch, as we have done with previous new hardware announcements."</p><p>Recently, GI.biz reporter Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1823411988342374567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "No developer I've spoken to expects it to launch in this financial year, in fact they've been told not to expect it in this financial year. A bunch of people I spoke to hope it's out in April/May time."</p><p>For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer said it corroborated this</a>, noting that the next Switch console won't be released until April 2025 at the very soonest.</p><p>Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann recently told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that his company "obviously" plans to develop games for the Switch 2 and that he "can't wait for it to be out." However, he's also OK with Nintendo taking their time to get it right.</p><p>"I mean, honestly, I'd rather have them wait a year and get it perfect than rush it to the market and then we all complain about what doesn't work. Switch has been such a fantastic product, I can wait another year if I have to," he said. "And from development, I think most non-Nintendo developers are not exclusively doing titles for the Switch. They're always part of a portfolio mix of platform mix. Just wait."</p><p>Recently, analyst David Gibson suggested the Switch 2 may release in March 2025. Gibson pointed out that one of Nintendo's assembling partners, Hosiden, is spending lots of money in preparation for... something. As such, Gibson suggested this might be related to the Switch 2.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/gibbogame/status/1831321550185959553" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No-one seems to have noticed the Nintendo assembler- Hosiden is spending ¥2bn on production equipment and ¥1bn on automation in FY3/25 for its major customer in amusement (Nintendo).

Nintendo, for its part, has said nothing at all about what to expect from its next system, apart from how the aim is for it to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-has-nothing-to-announce-but-says-next-console-aims-to-surprise-and-delight/1100-6512297/">"surprise and delight"</a> fans, so we only have predictions and guesses to go on for now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-nintendo-switch-2-details-continue-to-emerge/1100-6518945/">Digital Foundry reported</a> that the Switch 2 may use Nvidia's new custom variant T239 processor. The site compiled a PC based on what it believed the Switch 2's specs could be and found that it could capably run Death Stranding at 1080p at an average of 35 fps.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo consoles are historically less powerful than the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and many believe that might be the case for the next system as well. But no one knows for sure. Whether or not the Switch 2 could be a 4K-capable device or offer cutting-edge graphics and performance is unknown.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vandal </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-reportedly-has-magnetic-joy-cons-might-not-support-existing-ones/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) recently reported that the Switch 2 will use Joy-Con controllers once again, but this time, they will attach to the system magnetically. Whether or not the existing Joy-Cons you might own already will work on the system is unknown. The report also mentioned how the current Switch Pro controller will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tah4ALPgOk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Silicon podcast </a>recently (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode-battery-life-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), Moore's Law Is Dead and The Phawx had a conversation in which it was suggested by Moore's Law is Dead that the Switch 2 will be "clocked faster than we expect" in its docked mode. In undocked mode, it's "going to be clocked crazy low," apparently. The goal, apparently, is to help the Switch 2 have a longer battery life when played on the go compared to the original Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023" data-ratio="0.54519774011299" data-width="2124" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023"></a><figcaption>The next Nintendo console could launch in 2024</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png"></figure><p>While Switch sales boomed during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage presented new challenges for Nintendo as it struggled to meet demand.

At the same time, Nintendo's sales forecast for the financial year doesn't currently factor in Switch 2 sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-window-still-uncertain-despite-nintendos-earnings-news-analyst-says/1100-6523313/" data-ref-id="1100-6523313">but that could change in time</a>.</p><h2 id="Gen_AI_">Gen AI?</h2><p>Artificial intelligence, or more specifically, generative artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games--and technology in general. But will Nintendo implement genAI for the Switch 2 and its games? It remains to be seen, but Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently weighed in to say Nintendo will carefully consider the use of genAI.</p><p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A with investors</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>, Furukawa is reported to have said AI has been used in video game development for ages already for things like controlling enemy characters. But genAI is a different story.</p><p>"Generative AI, which has been a hot topic in recent years, can be more creative, but we also recognize that it has issues with intellectual property rights," he said. "We have decades of know-how in creating optimal gaming experiences for our customers, and while we remain flexible in responding to technological developments, we hope to continue to deliver value that is unique to us and cannot be achieved through technology alone."</p><h2 id="Switch_2_Games_and_Backward_Compatibility">Switch 2 Games and Backward Compatibility</h2><p>It's widely expected that Nintendo will release a new Mario Kart game for its next home console–there are not many safer bets in gaming that one could make. A report said Mario Kart 9 will have some kind of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-should-use-these-new-twist-ideas/1100-6499581/">"new twist,"</a> and fans are eagerly waiting to see what that might be. If a new Mario Kart game is in the works, it would seemingly make business sense for it to be a launch title for the next console. A report from 2023 said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-already-with-developers-launching-in-2024-report/1100-6516402/">a number of developers already had the new Nintendo console at their offices</a> and were beginning to build games for it, but none have been announced or even hinted at thus far.</p><p dir="ltr">A major question fans want to know is whether or not the next Nintendo console will support games from the Switch, and on November 6, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2</a>. Not only that, but Nintendo Switch Online will work across Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," Nintendo confirmed. "Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep checking back with GameSpot for more as we learn more about the next Nintendo console, as we'll continue to update this story as more information comes to light.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_Price">Switch 2 Price</h2><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 has not been announced, so everything is guesswork at this stage. But one analyst recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-employees-predict-when-they-think-switch-2-will-be-announced-and-what-it-will-be/1100-6520125/">predicted</a> that the Switch 2 will cost $400 and that its top-tier games will sell for $70. The original Switch launched at $300, and its relatively low price point no doubt helped the system perform exceptionally well in the market. Whether or not the next Nintendo console launches with just one SKU or multiple editions, at various price points, remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the prediction about game costs rising to $70, that wouldn't be very surprising. After all, Nintendo already charged $70 for Tears of the Kingdom, and it was a sales juggernaut at that price point. Nintendo said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-will-be-worth-its-70-price-tag-nintendo-president-says/1100-6512284/">that was a one-off for Switch game prices</a>, but charging $70 for Switch 2 games would bring Nintendo in line with what companies like Microsoft and Sony, as well as a variety of third-party publishers, charge for their leading titles.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_News">Switch 2 News</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's previous consoles had their own account systems and players had to create new accounts for subsequent hardware launches. But the new overarching Nintendo Account changes this, and this could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">ease the transition to the next Nintendo console. </a></p><p dir="ltr">It "allows us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition," Nintendo's Doug Bowser said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to minimize the dip you typically see in the last year of one cycle and the beginning of another," he added. "I can't speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's CEO, Shuntaro Furukawa, said in 2023 that the next Nintendo console will use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">the same Nintendo Account system as the Switch</a>, so hearing Bowser suggest something similar is no big surprise.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/nintendo-s-record-gain-tested-in-wait-for-switch-2-tech-watch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Yijia Zhai of Macquarie Group Ltd. said the next Nintendo console is not going to be able to match the success of the Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not think the new console will be as successful as the Switch, and see potential profit-taking after the announcement," Zhai said, further noting that Macquarie had downgraded Nintendo's stock analysis to "neutral."</p><p dir="ltr">Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata, meanwhile, said the next Nintendo hardware likely won't increase the total addressable market for Nintendo. However, the firm isn't married to that idea and says its forecast could change if the system "turns out to be new concept hardware rather than a successor along the same lines as the Nintendo Switch."</p><p dir="ltr">A console not being as successful as the last one might not tell the whole story and isn't necessarily totally bad news for Nintendo. The Switch, of course, performed exceptionally well in terms of hardware and software sales. And that success is all the more apparent following the dismal performance of the Wii U.</p><p>In September 2024, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said the next Nintendo console may "disrupt" the video game industry.</p><p>"A couple of things will really impact how things go: Nintendo's next hardware device, expected to arrive next year, could significantly disrupt the market," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheap-money-and-bad-bets-how-the-games-industry-turned-pandemic-success-into-disaster" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told GI.biz</a>. "Of course, not much is known about this device beyond rumor, but a highly successful new Nintendo device could apply downward pricing pressure across other devices. But we'll have to wait and see."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/uber-meta-creative-assembly-vets-found-studio-atelico-to-bring-generative-ai-to-video-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Studio Atelico is a brand new gaming startup that has been founded by veterans of Uber, Meta, and Creative Assembly. Today they announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/">new AI Engine</a> that will enable game developers to create game experiences that are powered by GenAI that run on-device without having to pay extortionate prices for cloud solutions. With Atelico AI Engine, the costs of production are significantly reduced for developers, and it provides them with an experience that gives them full control and power.</p>
<p>CEO, Piero Molino made a statement today regarding their new AI engine, saying: "The revolution is upon us. GenAI is enabling new interactive experiences that have never been possible before. However, the current, large-model approach that Cloud AI providers are taking is fundamentally flawed for video games. Game developers currently implementing GenAI in their games are struggling due to the high costs and the lack of fine-grained control needed in video game development."</p>
<p><iframe title="Studio Atelico - Generative Agents Real-time Playground (GARP)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/krOP_bIW74g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, Generative AI in gaming is a heavy point of contention for both the consumer and the creator. There are people who feel that it should be left safely in the hands of humans to develop, while others feel that there are creative minds out there who should be able to use tools to make the development process easier without having to put the effort in.</p>
<p>Already there are many games on the market using AI, with a fair few of them not disclosing the fact that they are using AI in their titles. An<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ex-Steam Labs developer</a> has claimed that there are over 1000 Steam games that are using generative AI. This includes titles such as The Finals, Tribes 3, and Atman: Rebel Flame.</p>
<p>While most known studios won't be using AI for their games, more and more studios and developers are coming out of the woodwork with AI games. With the release of the Atelico AI Engine, there will now be even more potential for AI titles.</p>
<p>The Atelico AI Engine can be embedded into game engines, where the user will have full control and flexibility with the modular design of the tool. To showcase the tool, Studio Atelico has released a tech demo which is inspired by the Stanford paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." You can see the tech demo above, where you can see the model in action.</p>
<p>"Atelico AI Engine is the perfect tool for developers to invent entirely new game genres. We foresee a Cambrian explosion of creativity, where our AI tools empower designers to build more immersive experiences and truly widen the horizon of what's possible. The only limitation is the developer's imagination," says <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/cloud-ai-for-video-games-is-dead-on-arrival?dm_i=2AEH,21IEL,AMZC5B,7EFIS,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ennio De Nucci, Co-Founder and Design</a> Director of Studio Atelico.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of TTRPGs have announced what they are looking forward to in 2025. The new year is rife with exciting TTRPG projects. Some are from beloved studios, and some are based on acclaimed properties. However, according to one survey, the most anticipated RPG is Son of Oak's <em>Legend in the Mist</em>.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/here-are-2025s-most-anticipated-ttrpgs-as-voted-by-you.709410/" rel="nofollow">EN World's annual survey</a>, dedicated TTRPG fans gave the spotlight to 10 games they were most looking forward to in 2025.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legend-in-the-mist-crow-thaumaturge-artwork.jpg?itok=bphsECIR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legend-in-the-mist-crow-thaumaturge-artwork.jpg?itok=UxTp_mBB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at number one is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-kickstarter-ends-with-over-16-times-its-funding-goal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legend in the Mist</em></a>. Son of Oak's successfully crowdfunded fantasy RPG made a splash on Kickstarter. The game, which uses the same underlying system as the urban fantasy TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/off-shelf-city-of-mist-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>City of Mist</em></a>, made more than sixteen times its funding goal, concluding with over $855,000 raised.</p>

<p>This is an impressive accomplishment in popularity given the game's competition. <em>Legend in the Mist</em> beat out Darrington Press' highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Modiphius' adaptation of an acclaimed British author Terry Pratchett's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/discworld-board-games-coming-courtesy-of-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em></a>, and fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the other entries in the Most Anticipated TTRPG have established quality names. MCDM Productions' <em>Draw Steel</em>, their <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mcdm-productions/mcdm-rpg" rel="nofollow">successfully crowdfunded</a> response to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tabletop-developers-prepare-for-ogl-less-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D OGL</a> debacle. Free League Publishing's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em></a> and <em>Alien: Evolved Edition</em>. Pelgrane Press' <em>13th Age Second Edition</em> and Necrotic Gnome's <em>Dolmenwood</em>. Even Paizo Inc's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder"><em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em></a> appears on this list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/draw-steel-dragonborn-warrior.jpg?itok=NoPQhPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/draw-steel-dragonborn-warrior.jpg?itok=mJ7LS5xK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>Legend in the Mist</em> stands out from its competition is its narrative focus. Characters don't have attributes but keywords, allowing background details and character traits to have in-game impacts on spells and weapons. In addition to the built-in character motivation and story arc system, the game can support tactical play, journeying, exploration, and just about any magic system,</p>

<p>Legend in the Mist is set to release digitally in Spring of 2025 with a physical release in Summer 2025.</p>

But how many units will the system sell? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US during 2025.</p><p>This assumes that the Switch 2 launches in the first half of 2025, Piscatella clarified. He added that the Switch should make up about one third of all video game consoles sold during 2025 in the US, excluding PC portable devices.</p><p>Piscatella went on to say that he expects the Switch 2 to face "hardware constraints" for several months after launch, and that the total number of units sold will depend on how many Nintendo can produce. Despite the popularity of a new Nintendo console, Piscatella said he continues to expect Sony's PlayStation 5 to be the No. 1 best-selling console in the US in 2025 based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo's platforms are popular globally, and US sales represent just one piece of the console's expected overall sales. Circana tracks the US video game industry specifically. </p><p>The Switch 2 has big shoes to fill, as the existing which has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 145 million systems and more than 1.3 billion games to date.</a></p><p>Nintendo has said it will officially announce the new console by the end of March 2025, and while we wait for that, the rumor floodgates have opened. Plenty of unverified images and details about the system, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">purported new Joy-Cons</a>, have emerged in recent days and weeks.

            <p>
With the decorations packed away for another 12 months and the new year now well and truly begun, developer Mojang has roused from its festive slumber to release six new features for public testing ahead of Minecraft's first planned update of 2025.
</p>
<p>
Mojang did, of course, announce it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">changing the way it released new Minecraft content</a> last September, revealing it would be ditching its traditional mega-sized summer updates in favour of multiple smaller drops throughout the year. And it's now <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-year-new-testing-features">detailed a number of the features</a> it'll launching (and that are now available for testing) in Minecraft's first update in 2025.
</p>
<p>
That starts with two new pig variants, intended to complement the bog-standard one that's been available in-game for 15 years now. More specifically, it's introducing the new cold pig and warm pig variants - found in sub-zero biomes and sandy biomes respectively.
</p>
<p>
Elswhere, forests biomes are getting an upgrade in Minecraft's next update, thanks to three new ambient features: falling leaves, leaf litter, and wildflowers. Falling leaves are encountered in all forest biomes, but leaf litter - which crunches underfoot and can be used to decorate other blocks - is exclusive to dark forests and wooded badlands.
</p><p>
Wildflowers, meanwhile, are found in meadows and birch forests (plus their old growth counterparts), manifesting as yellow and white flowers that can be crafted into dye. These all have four growth stages players can speed up with bonemeal, and will bloom in different patterns depending on the angle they're placed in.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/minecraft-springdrop-wildflowers_oEbJgNj.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/minecraft-springdrop-falling-leaves.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

 </a>
</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Mojang</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And finally for now, lodestones - the magnetised blocks players can place in order to helpfully attract their compasses while navigating - have a new, simpler crafting recipe.
</p>
<p>
All the above features are scheduled to arrive as part of Minecraft's next update, but they're first being released for public testing so adventurous players can put them through their paces. All six additions are accessible via Minecraft's latest Java snapshot right now, and everything except Minecraft's new leaf litter and wildflowers are available in the Bedrock preview and beta. Those two missing features should hit Bedrock "soon", and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features">more information on accessing Minecraft's test builds</a> can be found on Mojang's website.

However, the hope that the wonkiness would last felt like a pipe dream for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, as NetEase was eventually going to have to put out some balance changes that would tone down some of the shenanigans.

Some of the previously announced hero changes are here, such as the nerfs for Hela and Hawkeye and the buffs for Venom and Captain America, but there’s also a handful of smaller tweaks to a large swath of the roster. I’d still argue Cap needs a bit more damage to his kit if he’s going to be a brawler and that Hela’s minimal health reduction is not enough, but it’s probably the right approach to make some light changes here and there instead of turning the dial too far in either direction.</p><p>Individual heroes got rebalanced, but several Team-Up abilities also got some buffs.

And like Steam becoming the de facto way people play PC games in 2025, SteamOS will soon be the most popular way to play PC titles on the go, which is not great for Microsoft. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,194341,194651" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">The Steam Deck launched in February 2022</a></span> and within months, it had changed the landscape of the video game industry and popularized the idea of handheld, portable gaming PCs. But the Steam Deck wasn’t powered by Windows as most gaming PCs are these days. Instead, it was powered by SteamOS, a Linux-based, gaming-focused operating system that made it easier than ever to buy, install, and play almost any PC game on the portable device. And it’s SteamOS—and Valve’s dedication to making a gaming-focused OS—that made the Steam Deck a big hit. </p><h2 id="h142651"><a id=""></a>SteamOS is the reason the Steam Deck is popular</h2><p>Companies had tried to do handheld gaming PCs (not laptops) before Valve. One example would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPD Win</a></span>, which featured a full keyboard and built-in Xbox controls. It could play games, but it ran on Windows, and felt clunky and slow. Other Windows- or Linux-based handheld PC were similarly clunky, hard to use, and often expensive. </p><p>The Steam Deck succeeded because it’s dead simple and easy to use, thanks to SteamOS and its compatibility features. Nearly any Steam game you already own, besides VR stuff, can work on the Steam Deck. And, in most cases, you won’t have to do much of anything to get it running. You use the easy-to-navigate menus of SteamOS to select a game, install it, and hit play. That’s it. </p><p>In the years since Valve released the Steam Deck and its slick operating system, other companies like Lenovo and ROG have released Steam-Deck-like competitors. And while many of these devices are more powerful than the Steam Deck, none of them include SteamOS, instead running on Windows 11. As a result, these devices are harder to use and clunkier. And sure, the companies behind them have tried to add their own software to make things easier, but it’s never quite as simple as the Steam Deck It’s that simplicity that allowed a lot of people who didn’t consider themselves PC gamers to buy a Steam Deck and enjoy it anyway as a straightforward, console-like experience.</p><h2 id="h142652"><a id=""></a>Microsoft let Valve create and then dominate the market</h2><p>During all of this, Microsoft had a chance to potentially step in and offer a lightweight, easy-to-use version of Windows 11 that portable PC makers could slap onto their devices. But the parent company of Xbox never did. </p><p>Now, in 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve is ready to make it easier</a></span> than ever to install SteamOS on more devices. Not only that, but now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo has announced the first third-party device</a></span> that will ship with SteamOS.  I expect by 2026 all handheld makers will offer SteamOS versions of their existing devices; likely at a cheaper price, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989">Sure, <em>now </em>Microsoft is talking more openly about a portable</a></span>, Xbox-like device and changes to Windows 11 that will make it a more handheld-friendly experience. But it really feels like Microsoft dragged its feet for too long and is now trying to play catch up. And I just don’t think it will be able to offer a version of Windows 11 that will be better than SteamOS anytime soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Valve is soon going to let any company use its gaming OS as the backbone of future devices, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let users install SteamOS</a></span> on any portable PC they own.</p><p>This is likely to lead to a situation in which SteamOS is just considered the default way to play games on a portable PC, similar to how Steam is vastly more popular than Microsoft’s built-in Microsoft/Xbox/whatever app store that comes pre-installed on all Windows devices. And if SteamOS makes its way onto TV-based console-like devices or desktops, I think it will find a lot of success there too. A lot of people want to just play games, surf the web, and maybe listen to some music on their PC, and SteamOS can accommodate all of that easily. </p><p>Microsoft had a chance to compete with Valve in the handheld gaming space. Instead, it just...didn’t. Microsoft will likely never be able to dethrone SteamOS as the most popular way to play PC games on the go, especially if Valve keeps updating it to be better, faster, and easier to use. </p><p>Sure, Microsoft won’t go bankrupt anytime soon, but Xbox had a chance to dominate a corner of the gaming market and possibly expand its reach on desktop PCs, too. But time has seemingly run out for that to happen, and Valve has won again.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>The Punisher</strong><br>We’re slightly increasing the damage capability of Frank’s weapons.<br>– Slightly reduce the spread of Deliverance and Adjudication.</p>

Moreover, following its conclusion, the extra health will no longer vanish instantly but will instead diminish at a rate of 100 per second.</p>



<p><strong>Squirrel Girl</strong><br>We’re increasing the threat of Doreen and her furry friends in their ultimate ability.<br>– Addition of a new effect to the Unbeatable Squirrel Tsunami (ultimate ability): the squirrels will rush towards the nearest enemy after bouncing instead of bouncing randomly.<br>– Reduce the squirrel tsunami health from 600 to 300.</p>

<p><br><strong>Wolverine</strong><br>Logan will receive an increase to basic combat strength, but a slight decrease to the additional survivability after activating Undying Animal.<br>– Increase base health from 300 to 350.<br>– Reduce the damage reduction ratio provided by Undying Animal from 50% to 40%.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff the Land Shark</strong><br>We’ll be adjusting the range for his ultimate ability so it now better fits the warning marker.

(ultimate ability) range from a 10m sphere to a 10m radius, 5m high cylindrical spell field.<br>– Increase the healing of Joyful Splash from 140/s to 150/s.</p>



<p><strong>Luna Snow</strong><br>While we’ve enjoyed her dropping the bass, we’ve made adjustments to Luna’s ultimate ability to prevent players from abusing its healing capabilities.<br>– Increase the interval for switching between healing and damage in Fate of Both Worlds from 0.1s to 0.5s.</p>



<p><strong>Mantis</strong><br>We’ll be making Mantis a bit less fleet-footed, reducing her roaming support capability.<br>– Reduce Nature’s Favor (passive) movement boost from 2.5m/s to 1.5m/s.</p>

<p><strong>Thor – Storm – Captain America</strong><br>We’ll be enhancing the damage capability of Storm’s side of this Team-Up ability.<br>– Reduce the cooldown of Charged Gale from 20s to 15s.<br>– Increase the damage of Charged Gale from 50 to&nbsp;55.</p>

                <p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will become the first PC handheld not named Steam Deck to run on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/" data-ref-id="1100-6528686">Valve's SteamOS</a> when it launches this May. On paper, the $500 handheld is more powerful than the Steam Deck. That said, it doesn't have an OLED display or trackpads, so you'll have to weigh the pros and cons of the Steam Deck vs. Legion Go S to make your choice.</p><p>If you want a handheld running on SteamOS, that is.

It has an 8-inch 1920 x 1200 LCD display with 120Hz variable refresh rate. Other features include adjustable RGB light rings around the analog sticks, two back buttons, one trackpad, and a pair of levers on the back that modify trigger tension.</p><p>Unlike the original Legion Go, this one doesn’t offer detachable gamepads or a kickstand, opting instead for a solid, streamlined design built specifically for handheld play. Lenovo increased the battery capacity from 49.2Wh to 55Wh with the Legion Go S.</p><p>Lenovo will also launch a second Windows configuration in May for $600. This lower-priced model has 16GB RAM instead of 32GB. Preorders aren't live for the $600 model just yet.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17363582036264?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value">Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS Version)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17363582036264?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value">$500 | Releases in May</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The SteamOS edition isn't available to preorder yet, but it'll launch in May for $500. The Legion Go S will be the first third-party handheld that uses Valve's Steam Deck operating system. This model will receive the same updates as Valve’s Steam Deck. That means you won’t have to worry about Valve abandoning SteamOS on the Legion Go S, as the team is treating SteamOS as a unified platform regardless of which handheld you’re playing on.</p><p>While it retains the Ryzen Z2 Go chip and the 8-inch 1200p display, the SteamOS edition is limited to 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. You can upgrade your SSD or expand the storage capacity via microSD.</p><p>For comparison, the Steam Deck starts at $399 for the 256GB model with a 7-inch LCD display. The 512GB model with a 7.4-inch OLED display costs $549, and the 1TB OLED edition goes for $649.</p><p>If you opt for the Legion Go S, you'll get a faster processor and a larger 8-inch screen with higher resolution--1200p compared to the Steam Deck's 800p resolution. That said, the Legion Go S uses an LCD panel, whereas the 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck models have better OLED screens.</p><p>Lenovo went with a more conventional control layout with offset sticks, while the Steam Deck's two sticks, D-pad, and face buttons are essentially aligned. The layout admittedly looks odd, but the Steam Deck is a lot comfier than it looks. Valve's handheld has four remappable back triggers, while Lenovo's new handheld only has two. The Steam Deck also has two large trackpads, whereas the Legion Go S has one small pad. Adjustable trigger tension is unique to the Legion Go S.</p><p>With these differences, it'll be interesting to see how the Legion Go S stacks up against the Steam Deck. Expect to learn more about the handheld as we get closer to its May release date. We'll update this article when preorders are available.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>The Legion Go S isn’t the only upcoming handheld from Lenovo, as the brand is also working on a Legion Go 2. It’ll arrive sometime this year (an exact date is yet to be announced) and features a more powerful Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, an 8.8-inch, 144Hz OLED display with VRR, and a 74Wh battery.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon-while-you-can/1100-6528683/">Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-physical-edition-gets-ps5-reprint-snag-it-while-you-can/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-iphone-and-android-controller-is-50-off/1100-6524903/">Backbone One iPhone And Android Controller Is 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-preorders/1100-6528224/">The Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazios-massive-official-strategy-guide-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6528507/">Metaphor: ReFantazio Is Getting A Nearly 600-Page Official Strategy Guide</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Call of Duty's big Squid Game crossover event is in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-squid-game-event-bundles-announcement#VIPs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full swing</a>, and the newest DLC has landed in the store. Players can now buy the VIPs bundle, which allows players to don special masks inspired by the TV show.</p><p>The VIPs Tracer Pack, as it's called, includes two Operators--the Panther Mask VIP and the Lion Mask VIP. The bundle also includes the "Choicest" launcher, the "Lacquered" sniper rifle, and the "Satin Slayer" SMG. A new frag grenade skin, "Death Plated," is included in the bundle as well.</p><p>What's more, players get a new finishing move, "Pinky Up," as well as the "Gilded" emblem, "List Required" calling card, and "Very Important Player" loading screen. You can see this content in action in the video below. The bundle costs 2,400 COD Points, or about $20.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KTvPAodyBY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KTvPAodyBY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty's Squid Game event also includes the Pink Guards Tracer Pack and the upcoming Young-hee Tracer Pack.

Its release has ignited a debate among players about how far Activision will go to make money from microtransactions. Initially, Activision did not reveal the price of the Event Pass, but later did, confirming it would be 1,100 COD Points, or about $10.</p><p>In addition to the new store bundles, the Call of Duty / Squid Game event brought new modes to the game, including Red Light, Green Light and Pentathlon.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>This story includes content some readers may find disturbing.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Former employees of Brandoville Studios--an Indonesian support studio that worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> before closing its doors in August--recently stated that they were subjected to mental and physical abuse while working on the game. Now, Ubisoft has responded to their claims.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are deeply disturbed by the recent reports surrounding Brandoville Studios," an Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-deeply-disturbed-by-damning-reports-of-abuse-at-assassins-creed-shadows-support-studio" rel="nofollow ">told Eurogamer</a> when asked to comment on the controversy. "We strongly condemn all forms of abuse, and our thoughts are with the affected employees."</p><p dir="ltr">The claims of abuse were first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR9HQ2C6h_4">reported by People Make Games</a> in a 50-minute YouTube video uploaded earlier this week. In the video, former Brandoville employee Christa Sydney alleges that she was subjected to various forms of abuse by Kwan Cherry Lai. Cherry Lai is the wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai and was responsible for overseeing Brandoville's daily operations while the studio was still open.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sydney, Cherry Lai created a toxic work environment, using gossip to alienate employees and manipulating employees' schedules to an extreme degree. But the alleged misconduct didn't stop there--Sydney says Cherry Lai forced her to stay awake for days at a time, only allowing her a few minutes of sleep over the four days leading up to the 2022 External Development Summit conference. Sydney also alleges that Cherry Lai forced her to engage in Christian religious practices, made her write lines as a punishment, and even demanded Sydney send over photos of her daily work outfits for approval before coming into the office.</p><p dir="ltr">"5:30 AM we need to wake up and then like, pray to god, and then [at] like 6:00 AM we need to go do our exercise, and then 8:00 AM shower," Sydney said of Cherry Lai's desire to control employees' schedules. "9:00 AM be at the office, and then even like, what time we need to drink water--she also put it in the schedule. And then what time we eat, what time we go to bed… that sort of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">But according to Sydney, that was just the tip of the iceberg, and Cherry Lai's behavior would eventually escalate to physical abuse. Sydney says she was forced to film a video in which she slapped herself in the face 100 times as a form of punishment, and also claims she was directed to slam her head into a doorframe repeatedly before being forced to apologize for "mistakes."</p><p dir="ltr">"The earliest record that I have was a recording of me hitting myself in the mouth until it bled, and then she wanted me to take a picture of the blood in my mouth," Sydney shared in the People Make Games video, which includes chat logs, photos, and recorded footage backing up her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney previously spoke out about her experiences in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">2021 interview with People Make Games</a>, and says Lai forced her to film an apology video retracting her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Other former Brandoville employees have come forward with reports of abuse as well. Caesarion Balthazar, who also worked at Brandoville while the studio was still in operation, claims that Cherry Lai took large chunks of his paychecks, adding up to the equivalent of a month's salary. When he tried to leave the studio, he was told he owed Lai money for a series of training programs. There was a problem, however: He hadn't engaged in any of the training programs he was being charged for. Syifana Afiati, who worked at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024, claims she was overworked during her pregnancy, and refused time off when her child died shortly after birth.</p><p dir="ltr">After the studio was liquidated in 2024, Cherry and Ken Lai formed a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was hired on there as well, but later left after another incident with Cherry pushed her over the edge.</p><p dir="ltr">"She was taunting me. She was challenging me, basically," Syndey said. "I thought to myself, 'She already doesn't have anyone else [to work for her].' I was quite literally the only person left with her, and she was still doing this to me. But this time around I was like, 'You know what? I'm so tired, it's like 2:00 AM. I should order a cab home. When she realized that I wasn't going back to her, she panicked."</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney claims Cherry threatened her, but after years of abuse Sydney was at her limit. She refused to return to her position and began sharing her story, providing videos, photos, and text messages to back up her claims, which led to her story getting picked up by various news outlets and social media sites in Indonesia.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Ubisoft has denounced Cherry Lai's alleged actions, Lai herself gave a bizarre response when contacted for comment by People Make Games.</p><p dir="ltr">"To me, my part of the story is not important as long as my team are good and safe now," Cherry Lai said of the accusations. She refused to provide further comment.</p><p>Employees interviewed by People Make Games say that although CEO Ken Lai was not directly abusive toward them, he enabled his wife's conduct. At the time of writing, Ken Lai has not made any statements regarding the alleged abuse his wife engaged in. Brandoville Studios employees also worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/">Age Of Empires IV</a> during the timeframe the abuse allegedly took place, but Microsoft has not yet commented on the People Make Games video, nor has it addressed the allegations of abuse by Cherry Lai.</p>
