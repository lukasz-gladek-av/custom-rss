            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a hit: breaking all-time peak player count records on Steam, beating out <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Palworld</em> to become the second most-played game on the platform, and <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599">selling more than 10 million copies across all platforms</a>. In the few days after its release, it has become one of the most talked-about games of the summer — but for all the wrong reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussion of <em>Wukong</em> on social media has been dominated by people arguing about what constitutes a valid criticism of a piece of art. Reviewers of the game have become the target of harassment, and the general tenor of conversation has reached a level of toxicity that would likely make any potentially curious player run screaming for the safety of yonder <em>Fortnite</em> hills — myself included.</p><p>Despite that trepidation, I wanted to know what, if anything, about <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> as a game was worth all the digital ink being spilled on its behalf. And while no game is worth any kind of harassment, a few hours with <em>Wukong</em> have left me wondering: this is it? <em>Wukong</em> is a gorgeous game, but its simplistic combat drags down the experience into something that’s beautiful to look at but aggressively just OK to play.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a retelling of the classical Chinese fantasy novel <em>Journey to the West</em>.&nbsp;Its opening moments feature a flashy combination of cinematics and gameplay that has Sun Wukong, the monkey king, facing off against a godlike foe while a pantheon of Chinese gods and their celestial armies observe menacingly in the distance. It goes <em>incredibly</em> hard and tickled all my wuxia / Chinese historical drama-loving bits. However, Sun Wukong is defeated, and the game starts in earnest with the player being given control of a new character tasked with finding the relics that will awaken the monkey king from his centuries-long slumber.</p><p>Wukong has some elements of a soulslike game. There are various user interface elements that remind me of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Death causes enemies to respawn and resets player progress back to checkpoints called shrines, but it does not cause the player to lose leveling-up currency. The Destined One (DO), as he’s called in the game, can string together combos of light and heavy attacks. There’s a dodge system that rewards you with essentially more powerful attacks when executing perfect dodges. You also have magic at your disposal that lets you freeze enemies for a short amount of time or transform into creatures that have their own combat capabilities.&nbsp;</p><div><p>I respect that the developers built moments into the game specifically to appreciate that beauty</p></div><p>I’ve been playing on the Steam Deck, which probably isn’t the best device for the game. (<em>Wukong</em> isn’t labeled as Steam Deck certified, but that hasn’t stopped it from being <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed">the most-played game on the platform</a> over the last week.) In some spots, it chugged ferociously, even at the lowest settings. Nevertheless, the game’s environments are wonderful to behold, and I respect that the developers built moments into the game specifically to appreciate that beauty. Early on, I found a spot where DO can meditate, and the camera pulled back to show off an utterly gorgeous vista of a mountainous forest.</p><p>Despite its bombastic opening, the next few hours of the game did not come close to those initial heights — and combat is to blame. Enemies were trivially simple, and beyond one aberration of an encounter very early in the game, the bosses were, too. </p><p>After suffering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">ass-beating after ass-beating in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, I didn’t mind <em>Wukong</em>’s button-mashy combat style, but after a while, it got boring. The game’s narrative offset my boredom enough to keep me going. There’s a bestiary with highly descriptive entries that read like fairytales. Every time I defeated a new enemy, I’d immediately pause to read the new entry and see the enemy’s portrait that looked like a traditional woodblock painting.</p><p>It’d be nice if the conversation about the game ended here, but unfortunately, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has launched with a lot of baggage. In 2020, the game was introduced in the West with <a href="https://youtu.be/oRLhCxC886o?si=2ymVln2YCX0R0Gh2">a slick, 13-minute trailer</a> highlighting graphics and action that were impressive for a game still early in development. However, in November of last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west"><em>IGN</em> released a report on Game Science</a>, the studio making <em>Wukong</em>, that featured sexist comments from the game’s developers made on Chinese social media. When asked about those comments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/25/black-myth-wukong-the-summers-most-exciting-and-most-controversial-video-game">in recent interviews</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/black-myth-wukong-sexism-controversy-interview-no-comment/">with other outlets</a>, Game Science’s response has been “no comment.”</p><p>Then, in the run-up to the game’s launch earlier this week, screenshots of a document from Game Science began circulating on social media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/">featuring instructions on what influencers were and were not allowed to discuss</a>. The prohibited topics included covid-19, politics, the Chinese game industry, fetishization, “feminist propaganda,” and “other content that instigates negative discourse.”</p><p>Prerelease embargoes are common, though they’re usually limited to things like special character appearances, boss fights, plot twists, or anything the developers want to keep as a surprise for players. But it’s odd for a developer to dictate <em>how</em> a reviewer can talk about a game.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Some of the interesting monster designs from </em>Black Myth: Wukong<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Game Science</cite></p></div><p>This strange move has made <em>Wukong</em> a cause celebre within certain video game communities on social media. There is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">a small but loud contingent of gamers</a> who applaud Game Science’s refusal to speak on the sexist comments made by its employees, seeing the game’s success as a repudiation of what they call the “woke” video game industry and its concerted efforts to include the opinions and perspectives of marginalized identities. So much so that reviewers who don’t enthusiastically praise the game, or bring up its developers’ history of making sexist comments, have received Gamergate-levels of harassment.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Screen Rant</em>’s review, <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/">the author’s byline was removed “for their safety</a>.” The <em>IGN</em> reporter who wrote the initial report on Game Science was also subject to harassment, including since-deleted fabricated quotes saying they were “devastated” <em>Wukong </em>had amassed so many players. This level of violent response feels really silly for a game that’s already sold millions and is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/">sitting comfortably at an 81 on Metacritic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiosity is a powerful enticement, and I’m glad mine led me to try <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> rather than dismissing it out of hand for the unfortunate discourse. As I’ve said earlier, I love Chinese historical dramas, consuming them voraciously wherever I can get them. They have a tendency to run <em>long</em> — sometimes upwards of 100 episodes — and, unfortunately, not all of them can be bangers.</p><p>Playing <em>Wukong</em> felt like those middle episodes of a Chinese drama when the plot is spinning its wheels on the same conflict between the heroine and her evil stepmother / empress / sister / concubine. Nothing’s happening, but it’s still too damn pretty to put down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/madden-nfl-25-review-mut-boom-tech-franchise-1851630302<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Madden </em>needs a year off. </p><p>The annual NFL simulation juggernaut has been a late-summer mainstay for the video game industry for over 30 years now, bringing with it the most realistic portrayal of National Football League action there is to be found. The teams are here, the players are here, everything a football fan could want from an official simulation is here in<em> Madden NFL 25</em>.<br></p><p>As an avid fan myself—which reminds me, Go Birds—the yearly <em>Madden </em>drop should jazz me up for the upcoming regular season. As recently as a few years ago, it did; <em>Madden </em>was the signal that the NFL season was on the horizon, and the digital version would make the last month of waiting for the real thing easier.</p><p>Now though, as I sit here ready to watch some real Eagles football come September, my attitude toward <em>Madden </em>rests where no video game, much less the official simulation of one of the most popular sports in the country, should ever put its audience: Apathy. </p><h3 id="h118853"><a id=""></a>Bringing the boom</h3><p>The main addition to<em> Madden 25</em>'s football mechanics is Boom Tech, a complete redesign of the physics portraying the physicality on the field. Hundreds of small, subtle animations have been added to every point of contact during a game, and the results are tangibly better than previous years. In fact, I’d say this is the best on-field experience <em>Madden </em>has ever presented.</p><p>Every little detail—the angle of the defender, the speed of the ball-carrier, the hand the runner is using to hold the ball, etc.—-affects the results of each play thanks to this redesign. Football is a game of inches, so they say, and these extra physics-based additions make it feel like I’m earning that extra yard while being pulled down.<br></p><p>It’s neat to watch in motion, and precise execution garners some truly satisfying results. Pulling an opponent down in the open field brings a satisfying pop, to the point I can hear John Madden himself yelling “BOOM!” in my ear when I time the hit just right. Fighting through the offensive line and sacking the quarterback feels earned and worthy of the silly celebration that follows.<br></p><p>Speaking of, even celebratory moments like that offer an extra hint of authenticity through this new system. During one drive, DeVonta Smith caught a pass for 30 yards and a first down, and when the prompt appeared, I selected that he do a little dance. The dance ended with the traditional hand signal for first down–arm extended in a single chopping motion, for those unaware.<br></p><p>However, as Smith fully extended his arm, a defending player walked through the shot and into Smith’s arm. Suddenly, the two players started jawing at one another, Smith’s hand still resting where it touched the defender. It sounds small, and the moment was fleeting, but little encounters like this bring <em>Madden </em>closer to feeling like an actual NFL TV broadcast.<br></p><p>(Also, while I’m talking about celebratory dances: After a fumble recovery for a touchdown, the scorer and another defender did the Fusion Dance from<em> Dragon Ball Z</em> as a celebration. This isn’t a big deal, but it got a big cheer out of me.)<br></p><figure id="" data-id="5ac0ee2a1c91e306da5be8d407a04d6f" data-recommend-id="image://5ac0ee2a1c91e306da5be8d407a04d6f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nick Sirianni answers a question.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h118854"><a id=""></a>Wait, what did he say?</h3><p>One thing that does pull me out of that “actual TV broadcast” feeling, however, is the broadcasters themselves. Three different teams of commentators are included in this year’s game, including the first-ever female commentator, Kate Scott. For the most part, they do a good job calling the action, even though it’s painfully obvious how the game is pulling audio files to string sentences together. Mike Tirico’s tone at the end of a quarter is particularly weird, as he says “We’re Back! [slight loading] From Philadelphia! [slight loading again] After this!”<br></p><p>Sometimes, though, the game loads up the wrong situation and the commentary ends up being completely wrong. During an exhibition against the Vikings, I managed to sack Sam Darnold for a big loss. Both Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen started talking about how that was my “third consecutive sack,” implying I’d scored sacks on the previous two plays, and how devastating that was for the offense.<br></p><p>The problem is, the sack occurred on 2nd and 2, meaning the previous play was a positive one for the offense and definitely not a sack. When I paused and checked the stats, I found that it was indeed my third sack <em>of the game</em>, but they weren’t on consecutive plays. It’s a small misstep, but one that makes <em>Madden</em> feel less authentic.<br></p><p>Commentary aside, I just spent a good chunk of time praising <em>Madden 25</em>'s gameplay right after saying the franchise needs a break, and that may cause some confusion. However, that’s what makes the lack of depth across the rest of the game so damn frustrating. The <em>core</em> <em>product</em>– simulated football—is great; it’s the rest of the package that’s stuck in a rut. </p><p>Franchise and Superstar modes shine a spotlight on this issue. Franchise lets you run an NFL franchise while managing all of the spinning plates that entails, from building a roster to managing a coaching staff to fighting out my team’s overall strategy and schemes on the field. Superstar, meanwhile, shifts the focus to a single player, where you start as a rookie fresh out of college, drafted to an NFL team, and play through the created player’s career. Both modes, inherently, are a series of menus, as most of the decisions made off the field in both modes are handled via menu screens. The few times they do offer something different, other than playing football, they’re fleeting and don’t offer much of interest.<br></p><p>Take, for example, Franchise mode: As I start my franchise with Nick Sirianni and my Eagles, I’m given the option to take a sideline interview from the practice field. The reporter asks me which part of the team concerns me the most going into the season, and I’m given the option to choose “the offense” or “the defense.”<br></p><p>Now, perhaps I’ve played too many RPGs in my time, but with those dialogue choices presented to me, I’m expecting that whichever I select will be elaborated on in the next bit of dialogue. I might choose “the offense,” but Sirianni might say something like “The offense suffered toward the end of last season, but I’m hoping we can work hard and get back to the success we’re used to” or something like that.<br></p><p>Nope. I select “the offense,” and then big white letters flash “THE OFFENSE” on screen, implying Sirianni replied with just two simple words, no elaboration. For a franchise that strives on creating authentic experiences, that is simply <em>not</em> how many NFL coaches—outside of maybe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0GaUO67FYok?si=ZinQFLlQF_i0keG8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0GaUO67FYok?si=ZinQFLlQF_i0keG8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Belichick preparing for Cincinnati</a></span>—would answer that question, and I couldn’t help but laugh. Both Franchise and Superstar modes have weird conversations like this, and they feel more awkward than anything.<br></p><p>I understand these things aren’t the core focus of <em>Madden</em>, but for a franchise that promises authenticity, not applying it to these moments makes those claims feel disingenuous. Furthermore, while Franchise and Superstar are lacking in focus, another mode <em>definitely </em>isn’t.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-recommend-id="image://c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Jason Fanelli</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-recommend-id="image://c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h118855"><a id=""></a>MUT MUT MUT</h3><p>Madden Ultimate Team is clearly the top dog in the franchise now, and it shows. The first thing you do after turning on the game, after all, is start building your Ultimate Team by opening packs and playing a few tutorial challenges with the players you receive. After that, you’re bombarded with ads for the current MUT season, and MUT deals, and MUT-themed bundles, and these ads are designed to keep you going back into MUT even after you try to exit out of it. </p><p>I am not joking when I say that a full hour passed between my first boot of the game and my ability to play a standard exhibition game of football. In that time, I exited Madden Ultimate Team <em>three times</em>; once after the initial tutorial, and twice more after in-game ads pulled me back in. Then, when I finally got to the main menu, the order of selections started with Madden News, then Ultimate Team, and <em>then</em> Quick Play. MUT sits above the standard gameplay mode now, as if EA’s reverence to its card-based cash cow couldn’t be any more obvious.<br></p><p>Is MUT fun? Sure! Building a team with loot boxes randomized packs of players, and then using that team to play football is a good time, and the endorphin hit that comes with opening a top-rated player is cool. However, the way <em>Madden 25</em> is programmed to push players towards MUT, after they’ve already dropped the entry fee called “retail price” to begin with, has an air of “used-car salesman” tactics that I could do without.<br></p><p>I’m not naive enough to think that <em>Madden</em> will ever stop its yearly visits to store shelves. However, it is absolutely time for this franchise to receive a deep, substantial glow-up, especially this year with its new neighbor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-helldivers-2-best-selling-games-1851627890#:~:text=EA%20Sports%20College%20Football%2025,best%2Dselling%20game%20of%202024.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-helldivers-2-best-selling-games-1851627890#:~:text=EA%20Sports%20College%20Football%2025,best%2Dselling%20game%20of%202024."><em>College Football 25 </em>completely eating its lunch</a></span>.<br></p><hr><p>The core gameplay of <em>Madden 25</em> is great, but there are some severe problems with everything surrounding what happens on the field. Franchise and Superstar are starving while MUT is treated like a king. Commentary has glimmers of brilliance, but mostly comes off stilted or even incorrect. For every time I pumped my fist to the sky for something I liked, I held my head in my hands for something I hated.</p><p>The aging gunslinger known as the <em>Madden </em>franchise is showing some wear and tear, with <em>Madden NFL 25 </em>being the latest example. While I don’t ever expect it to be put out to pasture, it might be time for the old coach to take a year off to revamp its approach. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s full of relationship-building with complex characters, has stakes that are just high enough to draw me into the weight of each dialogue choice I make, and its supernatural elements don’t feel so overbearing that they detract from the humanity at its center. I’m hooked. I want to learn more about protagonist Pax and her group of nomadic, superpowered roadtrippers. But, my god, I haven’t hit a momentum killer like <em>Dustborn</em>’s action combat in a game I’m otherwise enthralled by in a hot minute.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,197209,196923" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dustborn </em>follows a group of four smugglers, three of whom are “Anomals,” which are essentially <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><em>X-Men</em> mutants</a></span> dealing with similar types of persecution. Pax can use her words to impose emotions, feelings, or actions on others. Her ex Noam can cancel out emotions entirely, which is good for diffusing a hostile situation or calming someone down from an anxiety attack. Using these powers in secret is one of the core tensions of <em>Dustborn</em>, as it both can expose the group to authorities who would gun them down if they knew they were Anomals, and because using Pax’s abilities can establish toxic, controlling dynamics between the cast. It makes every dialogue option feel weighty as you try to finish your country-wide smuggling job inconspicuously.</p><p>From the outset, <em>Dustborn </em>makes it clear that your relationships with your posse will take you down different ending paths, and I’m already finding myself wincing when I feel like my relationships with characters like Pax’s best friend Sai are on the rocks. Was I too hasty in using my powers to try and immediately fix a tense situation? Did I offer a gift at an insensitive time as I was figuring out how the dialogue mechanics work? We’re criminals with law enforcement at our front door. I thought I was being efficient, but now I see I was also being shortsighted. Hopefully, I’ll have time to make up for those mistakes as the game goes on, but <em>Dustborn </em>is effective at creating intense moments that test your patience and understanding of who you’re working with. There’s lingering baggage with each character from the outset, such as the unresolved relationship between Pax and Naom, or the lack of established trust between the group and their boss, the enigmatic absolute daddy Theo. <em>Dustborn</em> is already laying down multiple paths these relationships might follow, and I’m already drawn in by the possibilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="c7ffe3571782966815386aaa4382ea3c" data-recommend-id="image://c7ffe3571782966815386aaa4382ea3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo plays guitar with Dustborn's rhythm game UI at the forefront.

The music hasn’t made a huge impression on me yet, but there are more performances to come. The rhythm minigames themselves have been hit or miss, as rules about what the buttons I’m pressing correlate to in the music have sometimes made it difficult to actually get in the groove. Sometimes it feels like the required inputs are in time with the strums of a guitar, other times they correspond to vocals. The rules seem to change between songs, so I wonder what I’m supposed to actually be listening for as I anticipate every button press in-time with the prompts on screen. But while I expect I’ll get the rhythm down soon enough, I’m already dreading the next time I put down the guitar and pick up a bat to play <em>Dustborn</em>’s combat again.<br></p><p>Maybe I was spoiled growing up on character action games like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591"><em>Devil May Cry </em>series</a></span>, but I have always felt like my standards for that genre have been pretty high. Even fairly competent action games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier</em></a></span> don’t scratch the itch for me because they lack interesting enemy design that tests my skills and reflexes. <em>Dustborn</em>, meanwhile, makes such a flimsy attempt to emulate those games that its action is becoming an active roadblock to my enjoyment of the game. Pax gets a bat that she swings with imprecision, and it sometimes feels more like a half-hearted, shallow attempt at a beat-em-up than something with any depth. There are a few gimmicks that shake things up, like Pax using her powers to push enemies away or performing a quick rhythm interlude to deal greater damage to a single target. But overall, <em>Dustborn</em>’s attempt to add an action-oriented pillar to its gameplay loop feels ill-advised and overambitious. It’s always better to do fewer things well than it is to try and do too much.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-recommend-id="image://a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-recommend-id="image://a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, after the second combat encounter I was given an option to deemphasize combat for the rest of the game’s run. This is ostensibly to make the game easier for those who are just invested in the story, but <em>Dustborn</em>’s bat-swinging beatdowns weren’t even a challenge. They were just a trivial roadblock in the way of the things Red Thread Games does exceptionally well. President Theodore Roosevelt once said that one should “speak softly and carry a big stick,” but <em>Dustborn </em>doesn’t need a big stick to make an impact when the power of its words far outweighs the alternative. I’m hopeful I won’t have to pick up Pax’s bat that often as I continue her road trip, because all it’s done so far is make me want to turn this tour bus around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 179:single/related:817d6bc08344baa42c49b89891b10cd4 --><!-- empty -->
<p>It's been five years now since the PC version of <em>Borderlands 3</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/borderlands-3-is-the-next-big-epic-game-store-exclusive/">launched as a high-profile timed exclusive on the Epic Games Store</a>. At the time, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gearboxs-pitchford-steam-may-be-a-dying-store-in-5-to-10-years/">memorably mused</a> that Steam "may look like a dying store" in "five or ten years" thanks to increased competition from Epic and others.
</p><p>Fast-forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week's announcement of&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Borderlands 4,</em></a> and despite Pitchford's old comments, the sequel will not follow its predecessor's example of EGS exclusivity.&nbsp;The new game plans to launch on Steam and EGS simultaneously sometime in 2025 (alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions).</p>
<p>When one social media user <a href="https://x.com/ShitpostRock/status/1826109975594414283">noticed that change</a> this week, Pitchford responded with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458">another lengthy message</a> explaining why his early hopes for the Epic Games Store's rise to dominance were "misplaced or overly optimistic."</p>
<p>In the short team, Pitchford said his high hopes for Epic's effort were initially "validated" by the launches of <em>Borderlands 3</em> and 2022 spin-off <em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em> (which was available on EGS for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-spin-off-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-heading-to-steam-this-week">three months before its Steam release</a>). "<em>Borderlands 3</em> and <em>Wonderlands</em> demonstrated clearly that the customers show up for the games, not the storefront," he said.
</p><figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure>
<p>But Pitchford now says Epic didn't "successfully press its advantage" to take a significant chunk of Steam's dominant market power. "Famously, Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models continue to shoot themselves in the foot," Pitchford said.</p>
<p>"The industry gives Steam their monopoly because publishers are afraid to take the risk to support more developer and publisher friendly stores," he continued. "It’s all very interesting and there is a huge amount of opportunity in the PC gaming space for retail disruption, but no one seems to be able to make it happen."</p>
<h2>A limited success or an Epic failure?</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-thinks-egs-could-make-up-35-50-of-the-pc-gaming-market-by-2024/">Internal documents revealed in the Epic vs. Apple case</a>&nbsp;in 2021 show that both Gearbox and Epic seemed to benefit from the <em>Borderlands 3</em> exclusivity deal. Epic set a guaranteed sales floor of $80 million to help attract <em>Borderlands 3</em> to the platform—if the game sold less on EGS, Epic would pay Gearbox the difference to reach that amount. But Gearbox's game managed to hit that sales floor in just two weeks, bringing in more revenue on its own than the entirety of EGS had for the previous nine months while also attracting plenty of new EGS users.

                    Epic recouped its $80 million upfront revenue guarantee for <em>Borderlands 3</em> within two weeks.                  </p>

          </ul>
  </div>

<p>Not all of Epic's attempts to secure exclusives were so successful, though. In 2019, Epic paid roughly $542 million in minimum guarantees for exclusive titles projected to earn just $336 million over their lifetimes. That $206 million difference that amounts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/how-long-can-epic-afford-to-throw-money-at-the-epic-games-store/">throwing money at publishers</a> in hopes that their exclusive games would help attract new users to EGS.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>And that continuing effort hasn't been a total failure for Epic; by the end of 2023, the company <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review">said</a> there were 75 million active monthly users for its PC store, up from 68 million the year before. But that's still relatively tiny compared to Steam, which had 132 million active monthly users <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3133946090937137590">back in 2021</a>. While Valve hasn't released monthly user numbers since then, Steam's concurrent user peak has increased about 67 percent (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/">per SteamDB tracking</a>) since the end of 2021—from 21.17 million to 35.55 million. That suggests Steam's current monthly user number could be well over 200 million.</p>
<p>Things look worse for Epic when you compare the $950 million spent by EGS players in 2023 to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/video-game-insights-steam-pc-revenue-consolidation/">the estimated $8.8 billion Steam players spent</a> that same year.</p>
<p>To be fair, pushing a new PC storefront from a standing start to about 10 percent of Steam's massive revenue in about five years is impressive. But that result still has to be disappointing for Epic, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-thinks-egs-could-make-up-35-50-of-the-pc-gaming-market-by-2024/">projected in 2019</a> that EGS could represent 35 to 50 percent of the entire PC games market in 2024.</p>
<p>It's an open question whether Epic's limited success is a result of the company's failure to "press its advantage," as Pitchford opines, or just a sign that Steam's massive entrenched network effects have proven more resilient than he expected. Regardless, <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Steam launch— following the lead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/ubisoft-comes-crawling-back-to-steam-after-years-on-epic-games-store/">other former EGS exclusive publishers</a>—doesn't mean Pitchford has given up hope that a Steam-killer could still come down the pike.</p>
<p>"I sincerely hope Epic keeps up the fight and makes headway," Pitchford said. "Epic is going to have to prioritize the store and try some new initiatives while also doubling down on earning pivotal exclusives if it is going to have a chance. I also hope other viable competitors arrive. I am sure we will all be watching."</p>

            <p>Those lucky enough to secure a ticket to visit Nintendo's museum are in for a bonus treat: all eligible tickets will include a portrait of their Mii character.</p>
<p>As anyone accepting a museum ticket must have a Nintendo account in order to accept and use it, Nintendo is automagically customising tickets with each account holder's Mii.</p>

<p>"If tickets are assigned, upon entry to the museum, each visitor will receive a play ticket with the Mii character set to their Nintendo Account printed on it," Nintendo <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/guide/visit-flow/index.html">explains</a>, although it does stress that you'll need to set up your ticket in advance on the ticketing website first.</p>
<p>Scores and photos from interactive exhibits inside the museum will then be added to your Nintendo account, too.</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-peek-at-nintendo-museums-huge-controllers-super-scope-shooting-gallery-and-more">Miyamoto recently took us on a 13-minute online tour of the Nintendo museum</a>. It contains many of the products Nintendo has released since its founding in 1889, charting the evolution of Nintendo's approach to entertainment from its earlier non-video game products - including copy machines, baby strollers, RC cars, and pitching machines - into more familiar territory, beginning with 1977's early video game forays, the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Museum opens 2nd October in Kyoto, Japan, and tickets - if you're lucky enough to be able to visit - can be <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en">reserved right now</a>. Expect to pay 3,300 yen (around £17) for adults, with various concessions available for teens, children, and pre-schoolers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm those specifics, the Switch port of <em>MySims </em>is real and coming soon, according to a source familiar with the plans. EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>MySims </em>was a 2007 game for Wii and DS where players marshaled dozens of Mii-like custom characters in an effort to re-develop a town. Blueprints for building stuff are unlocked and a resource called essence is earned and exploited to design cool things. If you want to know what was so special about these games for some people, you can check out the sparse but still passionate MySims subreddit where long-time fans will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regale you with tales</a></span> of their favorite quirks, characters, and story beats.</p><p>There were also a bunch of sequel spin-offs with different themes ranging from the medieval <em>MySims: Kingdom</em> to the vehicle-based <em>MySims: Racing</em>. The characters in them offered a bit more of a whimsical approach to the Sims formula then the ever expanding suite of options in the hit <em>Sims 4</em>. Most of the <em>MySims </em>games were made by EA Redwood Shores, the studio best known for <em>Dead Space </em>which was later rebranded Visceral and shut down by EA in 2017. </p><p>It’s unclear if the return of <em>MySims</em> means that’s where EA’s ambitions for <em>The Sims</em> on Switch will end, with many fans still holding out hope that <em>The Sims 4</em> or another version of the mainline series would eventually get ported to Nintendo’s handheld hybrid console. Maybe the publisher is waiting until a Switch 2 is out to announce that, or maybe the <em>MySims</em> revival is the best that Sims fans on Nintendo’s platform are getting right now. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was looking a bit touch-and-go for real-time stealth-tactics fans after developer Mimimi Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-developer-announces-final-ever-release">shut up shop</a> following last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">superb Shadow Tactics</a>. But thankfully it seems there's more than a little life left in the genre, what with the imminent arrival of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumerian-sixs-pulpy-stealth-tactics-almost-manages-to-fill-that-mimimi-shaped-hole">promising Sumerian Six</a> and now this: a new Goya-inspired stealth-tactics adventure from The Game Kitchen, the studio behind the wonderfully moody <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> series.
</p>
<p>
The Stone of Madness, as it's known, transports players back in time to an 18th-century Spanish Monastery - serving as both a prison and an asylum - located somewhere in the Pyrenees mountains. Here, five prisoners plan their escape through its gloomy corridors, which, of course, is where all the real-time stealthy stuff starts to come in.
</p>
<p>
As the adventure unfolds - well <em>adventures</em>, given it promises two fully fledged campaigns, each with unique stories, objectives, and characters - players will alternately control five distinct characters: Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo. Each has their own unique upgradeable skills, enabling them to - among other things - cast spells, distract and kill enemies, stun evil spirits, and access hard-to-reach areas.

<p>
However, The Stone of Madness also takes a page from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s playbook, meaning characters also have traumas and phobias players will need to deal with. If these are triggered during their escape, their sanity depletes, eventually causing paranoia, dementia, violent outbursts, and more - "fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played".
</p>
<p>
There are further wrinkles promised, too, with players also needing to take into account the time of day. Perhaps unexpectedly, sneaking, exploration, and gathering materials are said to be safer in the daylight, when guards are more easily distracted. However, as time passes, the monastery's ghostly inhabitants will begin to reveal themselves, affecting characters' sanity. And when night falls, the curfew coming into effect, security is much tighter. The Game Kitchen says players might prefer to plan and manage their escape after dark, but teases the rewards found after nightfall might be worth the risk...
</p>
<p>
It's intriguing stuff, and The Stone of Madness is currently set to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-stone-of-madness-7b22f3">Epic</a> early next year. And if you fancy a bit of tactical action before then (albeit not of the real-time or stealthy kind), might I suggest you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-breach-wizards-review">pop over here</a>?

		<p>It’s been a busy old week in video games, and so the fitting way to spend my Friday afternoon is to tap out a quick catch up on What We Played, which travelling on a very delayed, very diverted train to escape Cologne. Wish me luck in my continuing adventures!</p>
<p>But train travails is now what we’re really here to talk about, and Dom and I had a jam-packed week of previewing games at Gamescom 2024. We’ve played and seen around 40 games between us, both big and small, and we’ll be churning out our features and write ups over the coming fortnight. But what have we enjoyed seeing the most?</p>

<p>For me, the three games that I’d pick out as highlights were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/rebellion-reveal-atomfall-which-looks-a-bit-like-fallout-goes-british/">Atomfall</a> by those folks at Rebellion, a game which is probably a good bit different to what you think, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">Civilization VII</a>, which is exploring some fascinating ideas for the 4X genre, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/22/rogue-waters-sails-the-turn-based-tactical-roguelite-seas-in-september/">Rogue Waters</a>, which has a really fun take on turn-based tactical gameplay that’s a lot about positioning and cascading abilities.</p>
<p>As for <strong>Dom</strong>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was one game that really stood out, and he rather enjoyed how very British is felt, Dying Light: The Beast with the return of Kyle Crane, and then the musical RPG of Fretless.</p>

<p>On to everyone else, and<strong> Nic B</strong> has continued to enjoy his time with MTG Arena, exploring the online-only pre-con decks, and a smidgeon of Monster Hunter Now.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> continuing adventures in Fallout: New Vegas have taken him into the Lonesome Road DLC, which has been a nice narrative detour (with a big difficulty spike). He’s also tried out Rise of Ronin using his PS Portal, which wasn’t quite conducive to the split-second reflexes needed. And most significantly, he’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> for our review, “As a lapsed Overwatch addict, it’s definitely hitting that hero shooter sweet spot, with a vibrant catch of heroes who each tout markedly different playstyles.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been on the review train with an eclectic mix of Truck racing with Monster Jam Showdown, old-school Zelda-ing with Crypt Custodian, and a spot of retro 2D shoot ’em up-ing with Shadow of the Ninja Reborn. <strong>Aran</strong> in the same carriage, playing Gori: Cuddly Carnage for review and Beyond Galaxyland for a preview.</p>
<p>The re-release of the TimeSplitters trilogy on PS5 had <strong>Miguel</strong> diving back into these FPS classics, but he’s still spent most of his time with Ace Combat 5. From there, “a really wild racing game kick” bounced him between&nbsp;Ride Ridge 2, Ridge Racer 6, F1 2023, Split/Second and Midnight Club Los Angeles.</p>

<p>And finally, we come to <strong>Gamoc</strong>. He’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. The review embargo isn’t up until Monday at 2PM, so keep an eye out for something around about then!</p>
<p><em>Now, what have you been playing this week?</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Developers Confirm 30 FPS Was The Target In Development]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target-in-development.962085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview with members of the Iron Lords Podcast, Matt Hansen, Art Director, and Ryan Warden, Production Director, sat down to talk about Avowed and what players can expect from the game. One of the most surprising things from <a href="https://x.com/GPTGamingNews/status/1826920564700631363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the interview</a> was that their target during development for Avowed was 30 FPS across the board. Considering Avowed is a first-person action RPG, this number surprises quite a few people. While many are defending their statement, saying that you don't necessarily need 60 FPS for a game like this, some wholeheartedly believe that 60 FPS should be the bare minimum.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exclusive Avowed Interview Ft @MrMattyPlays | Gameplay Q&amp;A | Xbox Consoles 30FPS? | Gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxBL4jTHs5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, they haven't explicitly said whether the game will be able to run at 60 FPS or not, but they have expressed that Avowed will hit 30 FPS with plenty of flashy effects in place to make the game more desirable.</p>
<p>Much like in <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-possible-endings-now-reach-into-double-digits/">another post</a> we wrote about Avowed, there are macro and micro endings for players to achieve. Those excited to get into the game now know that the ending slides have reached double digits. However, how many are macro endings remains to be confirmed, with multiple variations. According to the interview, though, there are well over 50 variations for players to encounter.</p>
<p>In Avowed, players will play as the Envoy from the Aedyrian Empire, where they are then sent on a mission to the Living Lands to investigate the Soul Plague. While this game does take place in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, the two stories are not directly connected. However, playing Pillars of Eternity does offer the opportunity to get some additional context for Avowed.</p>
<p>The interview with the developers dove into some other essential details for Avowed, such as the lack of a traditional class system. Instead, players are given full authority to explore abilities as they wish, mixing and matching abilities from classes to create the hybrid class that works for them. This helps contribute to the many different ways players can play the game, allowing them as much freedom as they want to create their playstyle that suits them for the journey through Avowed.</p>
<p>The full interview is over thirty minutes long, and they break down plenty of important factors of Avowed, such as the delays that the game experienced, the world-building, and trying to make it seem as dense and populated as possible.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the developers of Avowed will see the mixed opinions on the 30 FPS choice for the game or not, but there is the possibility that they will later make a statement about it or begin to tailor the game to run at a higher FPS for those who want a smoother experience.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has sold 10 million copies since launch. As a reminder, the game was released on August 20th, which was just three days ago.</p>
<p>GameScience thanks players for their "support and love" for the game, wishing everyone a "great gaming weekend" in the post. The developer also includes some artwork of the player character clutching his healing gourd.</p>

<p>It's fair to say the rise of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has been meteoric, to say the least. Since being announced back in 2020, hype for the game has built and built, resulting in&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>being the most-wishlisted game on Steam prior to its release.</p>
<p>After its launch, the game quickly began to climb the Steam charts, topping the 24-hour concurrent player count list <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count">within just a handful of hours</a>. Further success seemed inevitable, and, indeed, so it has proven.</p>
<p>The rapidity of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s rise can, it seems, largely be attributed to Chinese players. As <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/black-myth-wukong-behind-the-numbers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this (paywalled) article from GameDiscoverCo</a> points out, around 88% of the game's player base is based in China, and 94% of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s Steam reviews are in simplified Chinese.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s developer is Chinese, it perhaps stands to reason that the majority of the game's players would be in the studio's native country. Still, it demonstrates the power of China as a demographic when it comes to gaming.</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, with an Xbox Series X|S version planned for later down the line.

<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake launches in October, and many fans have wondered about game length and how long it’ll take to beat the game. Now, thanks to the game’s creative director, we have an answer.</p>



<p>In responding to <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1825636867900838162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">questions on Twitter</a>, creative director Mateusz Lenart says that Silent Hill 2 remake should take between 16-18 hours to beat on the first playthrough. He then added that it could taken even longer than that depending on how you play.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“If you like to spent your time searching for everything that we put into the game and things we’ve hidden for you, it will take you more than 20 [hours] for sure,” he said. “I’m not counting the new game plus and all endings of course. </p>



<p>“I’m curious how fast will you get all of them.”</p>



<p>As far as the time length goes, a 16- to 18-hour playthrough puts the remake ahead of <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/8523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">what the completionist time</a> is for the original Silent Hill 2 from 2001. And, for the most part, fans seem excited about the extended time to play the game.</p>



<p>“That is some very pleasantly surprising news,” <a href="https://x.com/Micahmakefunny/status/1826753846447894726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user said</a>.</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/LukeCastles1/status/1826699655495000315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>, “That’s a lot longer than the original, I’m very excited for this.”</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake releases October 8 for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game is a PS5 console exclusive for at least a year, according to reports. After which, it will be able to come to Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>We're big proponents of gaming headsets. They create a private, immersive listening experience that can make games more engrossing. Some games even encourage you to wear one to get the best audio experience. Gaming headsets are integral to the online multiplayer experience, not just for chatting with friends, but because it's often easier to pinpoint audio cues while wearing one. <span>While some may prefer the immediacy and simplicity of wired headsets, the freedom afforded by wireless headsets is unmatched. And thanks to low-latency 2.4GHz connections and modern Bluetooth technology, issues that plagued wireless headsets in the early gaming headset boom, like playback delay or lower audio quality, are virtually unheard of if you buy from a decent brand. Wireless headsets can sound as good and perform as reliably as their wired counterparts.</span></p><p>For anyone out there looking for a new gaming headset, we've put together this list of the best wireless gaming headsets you can buy in 2024. If you've read any of our other headset roundups, you won't be surprised to see the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a> in the top slot as the best wireless gaming headset in 2024. We simply haven't found any competitors that can match its blend of high quality audio, comfort, and price. That said, it's not our only recommendation. Some users will want something more affordable, while others may be able to splurge on higher-end models that offer even more features. So, we've made sure to include picks from a variety of price points, features, and styles--including a couple of wireless earbud options, led by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's Inzone Buds</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for more recommendations, including wired models, be sure to check out our lists of the best headsets for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-headset/1100-6482578/" data-ref-id="1100-6482578">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-headset/1100-6485694/" data-ref-id="1100-6485694">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-headset/1100-6486018/" data-ref-id="1100-6486018">PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-mic-headset/1100-6497491/" data-ref-id="1100-6497491">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><div title="6525389 - Best Wireless gaming headsets" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2534" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525389 - Best Wireless gaming headsets" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset\/dp\/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Wireless Gaming Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset\/dp\/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life</strong>: 38 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz; Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio:</strong> Yes (Tempest 3D Audio, 360 Spatial Audio)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Retractable noise-canceling boom mic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Switch, Steam Deck, Mobile</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 7 (and its console-specific variants the 7X and 7P) take the top slots in our best headsets lists for each console and PC, so its ranking as our favorite wireless headset overall should be no surprise. Every model in SteelSeries Arctis Nova line is an excellent choice, but the Nova 7 offers the best mix of sound quality, features, and comfort without pushing into luxury-tier prices.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova 7 shares its best feature with the rest of the Arctis Nova lineup: The ComfortMax system. This ingenious adjustable suspension design gently supports the lightweight--but durable--rubber-coated steel headband above your head rather than memory foam padding like other headsets. The headband design coupled with SteelSeries' breathable AirWeave ear cushions makes the Nova 7 comfortable for long gaming sessions. However, what makes the Nova 7 stand out among its Arctis peers is its sound quality, which is second only to the high-end--and much pricier--Nova Pro. It supports 3D spatial audio and works on a wide range of devices via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova 7 comes in three versions: The standard Nova 7 works on PC, Switch, and mobile. The 7P supports all those devices, plus PS5. Meanwhile, the 7X works on Xbox and all the aforementioned devices, including PS5 with Tempest 3D Audio. The lone difference in features between the headsets is the wheel on the right earcup: The Nova 7 and 7P are equipped with a sidetone dial for microphone monitoring, while the 7X has a Chatmix dial for party chat. PC users get the most customization features thanks to the SteelSeries desktop app.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth mentioning that SteelSeries sells accessories to help you <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fheadset-accessories%3Fin_stock%3Don&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-wireless-gaming-headset%2F1100-6525389%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">customize your Nova 7 headset</a>, should you ever want to switch up its look, The earcup faceplates and elastic headband are swappable.

The Nova Pro looks like the other headsets in SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line and shares the same super-comfortable headband design, but there are some major differences that justify its higher price tag. It has a better build quality with a more robust steel-reinforced design and leatherette earcups.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova Pro connects to your PC or console wirelessly via the included base station that can be linked to two devices at once. The base station includes an OLED and a simple dial-based controls you can use to navigate the Nova Pro's many settings, including EQ, mic mix, active noise canceling, and more. Normally, features like EQ balancing would require a PC or mobile app, but since everything is handled within the base station, all of those features are available regardless of the device you're connected to. That said, PC players can use SteelSeries' Sonar software to access even more granular controls and pre-made audio profiles for specific games.</p><p dir="ltr">Another great feature of the Nova Pro is its dual-audio input support. This means you can connect to one device through the base station and another via Bluetooth and listen to both at the same time. This is great for anyone who likes to listen to podcasts or music on their mobile devices while they game on their consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">To top it all off, the Nova Pro comes with two rechargeable, hot-swappable batteries that you charge in the base station. That means you essentially have endless battery life as long as you make sure one pack is always charging. That said, the headset does allow for wired 3.5mm connections if you're in a pinch. It's also worth noting there's a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWF9BCJ?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superb wired model</a> that will save you a decent amount of cash, but you'll be missing out on some of the wireless features. Additionally, the wired version connects to SteelSeries' GameDAC, which makes it better for those who play at their desk as opposed to on the couch.</p><p>Just like with the Nova 7 series, you'll need the Xbox version of the Nova Pro for support across all consoles and PC. The Nova 7 and 7P will work with all of your consoles and PC except for Xbox.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X\/dp\/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Premium Wireless Gaming Headset (Runner-up)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X\/dp\/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Turtle Beach Stealth Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life:</strong> 12+ hours (per swappable battery pack)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz; Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes (Windows Sonic, PS5 3D Audio, Dolby Atmos, DTS Headphone: X)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling:</strong> Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Removable noise-canceling boom, plus integrated mics</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Switch, Steam Deck, Mobile</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is another high-end alternative to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. One of its coolest feature is an integrated DAC (digital audio converter), which can enhance the audio quality beyond what its already excellent 50mm Nanoclear drivers would normally achieve. The only drawback to this is that it adds more internal hardware, making for a bulkier design, especially the earcups.</p><p dir="ltr">The larger design is one of the Stealth Pro's few downsides, and the rest of the headset is excellent. It features multiple mics for clear audio pickup, supports various spatial audio formats, and connects to a wide range of devices via 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.1. Its active noise-canceling tech is fantastic for a gaming headset--perhaps even slightly better than what's found in the Nova Pro.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the Nova Pro, the Turtle beach also uses dual, hot-swappable battery packs. Each pack holds up to 12 hours of battery life, and features quick charging, so you can effectively keep playing indefinitely as long as you keep the extra pack charged up so you can swap them out when needed.</p><p dir="ltr">The Xbox version of the Stealth Pro works wirelessly on all platforms, whereas the PlayStation edition is compatible with everything except Xbox.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Budget Wireless Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li><strong>Battery life: </strong>60 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz, Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style: </strong>Retractable noise-canceling boom mic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, Steam Deck, Mobile</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Yep, we've got one more Arctis Nova model for this list. If the Nova 7 and Pro are out of your price range, the Nova 5 is the option for you. It's more affordable than its siblings but still sounds great. The Nova 5 uses the ingenious headband strap design we love about the other models. It's also a touch lighter than the rest, making it even more comfortable for long-term use.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova 5 isn't just a lighter and more affordable version of the other Arctis models, however. It also has its own unique capabilities, namely an exclusive mobile companion app available for iOS and Android that includes over 100 EQ presets for popular games like Call of Duty, Destiny, and Minecraft. The headset lets you connect to your phone via Bluetooth while also connected to a console or PC over 2.4GHz so you can swap EQs in the app on the fly. Unfortunately, you cannot listen to both sources with simultaneous connection, but that's one of our few misgivings about the Nova 5.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the app and multiple connection options, the Nova 5 also has a noise-canceling microphone that fully retracts into the left earcup, sports up to 60 hours of battery life, and has fast charging via the included USB-C cable.</p><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 5 headset is available in three different models: the all-black Nova 5, the blue and black Nova 5P, and green and black Nova 5X. All three models support PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, but only the 5X supports Xbox consoles. They also support spatial audio on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Wireless Headset (Runner-Up)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life: </strong>70 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz; Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style: </strong>Detachable wideband boom mic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, Mobile, Steam Deck</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While we might prefer the look and feel of the Nova headsets, the BlackShark V2 Pro puts up strong competition and easily ranks as one of the most comfortable headsets out there.

It supports wireless connections via Bluetooth or Razer's low-latency 2.4GHz HyperSpeed tech. The only real downside is that it lacks true active noise-canceling tech, but otherwise, this is one of the best headsets out there, and a great alternative to SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a theme on this list, but yet again, you'll need the Xbox edition for wireless support across all devices, while the PlayStation and PC editions support everything besides Xbox consoles.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N\/dp\/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Wireless Gaming Earbuds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N\/dp\/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Sony Inzone Buds</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life: </strong>12 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4 GHz; Bluetooth LE</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes (Tempest 3D Audio, 360 Spatial Audio)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Multiple integrated mics</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>PS5, PC, Switch, Steam Deck, Android, iPhone 15 (older iPhones with adapter)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">So far, we've covered standard gaming headsets, but wireless earbuds are another great option for cordless audio while gaming, and the best choice is Sony's Inzone Buds. These true wireless earbuds were designed with gaming in mind with support for 360 Spatial Audio on PC and Tempest 3D Audio on PS5. The Inzone Buds also implement some of the audio giant's best tech to help them thrive beyond gaming, too.</p><p dir="ltr">From a noise-canceling standpoint, the Inzone Buds are the best option on this list. Sony is well-known as one of the best in the business for ANC, and that is on display with the manufacturer's first pair of gaming earbuds. The Inzone Buds also utilize the same drivers found in Sony's flagship <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WF-1000XM5 Bluetooth earbuds</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sony Inzone Buds last up to 12 hours on a single charge, which is pretty decent for a pair of wireless earbuds. Their design minimizes ear contact, which makes for a more comfortable wear.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Inzone gaming gear--Sony also has over-ear headphones, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Wireless-Canceling-Over-ear-Headphones/dp/B0B1TDHLPT?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">high-end Inzone H9</a> that <em>just </em>missed the cut on this list--the Inzone Buds were designed with PC gaming in mind. With the Inzone Hub Windows app, you can customize your audio experience and save your settings to the earbuds.</p><p dir="ltr">Though best suited for PC gamers, these earbuds fully support the PS5's suite of audio features. It connects to both PC and PS5 via the included USB-C dongle. You can also use the Inzone Buds on other devices with audio-supported USB-C ports, including Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">On mobile, however, things are a bit different than usual for wireless earbuds. Android users with a newer phone equipped with Bluetooth LE can ditch the dongle if they so choose, but since Apple hasn't implemented Bluetooth LE in its devices, you'll need to use the dongle. For iPhone 15 users, this isn't a big issue--unless you have a bulky case, which may require a USB-C extender to attach the dongle. Those with iPhones with legacy Lightning ports will need a Lightning to USB-C adapter that supports audio output.</p><p dir="ltr">To clear up any confusion: Inzone Buds are manufactured by Sony Electronics and released before <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PULSE-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CMDFSB89?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's Pulse Explore earbuds</a>. Sony Inzone Buds cost the same and have noise-canceling tech as well as better audio and overall design. Pulse Explore earbuds do, however, support standard Bluetooth.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized\/dp\/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Bluetooth Gaming Earbuds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized\/dp\/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life: </strong>24-30 hours with charging case (varies by model)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>AirPods Pro only</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Multiple hidden noise-cancelling mics</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>PS5, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Mobile, PC, Xbox with Bluetooth adapter.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While not traditionally thought of as a gaming peripheral, Apple's AirPods are great for gaming simply because of their ubiquity. Chances are, if you own an iPhone, you have a pair of these lying around <em>or </em>you have thought about buying a pair. Since they can pair up with any Bluetooth-supported device, you can quickly sync them to PS5, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or any other mobile device you're using for games. They work on PCs, too, provided you have integrated Bluetooth or a USB Bluetooth dongle. And for Xbox, you'll need to pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skull-Co-AudioBox-Transmitter-Controllers/dp/B09NMP462M?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox-specific Bluetooth converter</a> like this one from Skull &amp; Co.</p><p dir="ltr">AirPods won't outclass a gaming headset or a pair of good headphones, but they sound pretty good, and their integrated mics mean they can work like a headset in a pinch. We recommend going with the AirPods Pro since they have better overall sound quality and active noise cancellation. For a cheaper but still solid option, the 3rd Gen standard AirPods are worth a look, but the 2nd Gen AirPods are still available and work great, too--especially for the price.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

            <p>Obsidian is targeting 30fps on Xbox consoles for its fantasy RPG, Avowed.</p>
<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w">Iron Lords podcast</a>, Obsidian art director Matt Hansen said the studio is "core targeting 30 frames per second, bare minimum" for the upcoming release, adding since "it's a first-person, single-player game, you don't necessarily need that 60 frames".</p>
<p>Explaining further, Hansen said this will allow the Avowed team to "get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff".</p>

<p>"It's a trade-off we opted to make relatively early, and we're really happy with that," the art director continued. "The game's running pretty smooth for, you know, how visually dense it is, and that was always our goal."</p>
<p>He did note, however, the team is still hashing out some of the final performance bits and pieces. "It's one of the last things you do," Hansen said.</p>
<p>(As a general point, earlier this year the game's director confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-can-be-played-in-third-person-obsidian-confirms">Avowed could also be played in third-person</a>, however Hansen did not mention this during the podcast.)</p>
<p>Avowed is currently set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-avowed-reportedly-delayed-from-2024-to-early-next-year">release across Xbox and PC on 18th February next year</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom went hands on with the fantasy RPG earlier this week. "I'm more intrigued than I was, certainly, now I have a novice understanding of its playstyle and story," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">Eurogamer's Avowed preview</a>.

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle was previously slated to be an Xbox exclusive. However, that idea has since been scrapped, and the game will also be coming to PlayStation 5. Xbox confirmed this on Tuesday at Gamescom Opening Night Live, where it was revealed that the game will be swinging onto PS5 in early 2025. However, those on PC and Xbox Series X|S will experience the adventure on 9 December, 2024. Today, Phil Spencer spoke about upcoming changes for Microsoft.</p>
<p>This announcement spells out a huge change happening at Xbox, as this is the latest first-party Xbox game to be announced on PS5. This year has already seen some significant announcements for Xbox, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Sea of Thieves, and Pentiment, which will also be coming to alternative platforms, such as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>During an<a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1826246589977153723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1826246589977153723%7Ctwgr%5Efee93a41b2c89426528ec32cc9492cfb3045d0a1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Ftheres-going-to-be-more-change-phil-spencer-speaks-on-indy-ps5-news%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> interview today</a> at Gamescom, Phil Spencer was asked to comment on Xbox's latest announcement and the stark change from their previous statement regarding Indiana Jones in February.</p>
<p>"Going to the PlayStation announcement, obviously, last spring we launched four games- two of them on the Switch, four on PlayStation - and we said we are going to learn." Looking at the statistics side, having the games launch on multiple platforms other than being an Xbox exclusive greatly benefits Microsoft.</p>
<p>"What I see when I look is that our franchise are getting stronger, our Xbox console players this year are as high as they've ever been, so I look at it and I say, our player numbers are going up for the console platform, our franchise are as strong as they've ever been... and we run a business," says Phil Spencer at Gamescom.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, Phil Spencer spoke up about the changes in the gaming industry and the pressure it's facing as a whole. This year alone has seen thousands of layoffs across all types of companies in the games industry, with Microsoft included in that statistic. Spencer claimed that traditional ways of distributing games would continue to change.</p>
<p>"The last thing that I'll say is I think as an industry right now, there's a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time and now people are looking for ways to grow." Which, when looking at the statistics of all major gaming consoles and sales, that doesn't strictly feel true. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-sales-down-52-year-on-year-in-europe-while-ps5-sales-are-up-143/">Xbox in particular</a> has sold the least amount of units, particularly in Europe. In addition, they've also been dealing with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">complaint filed by the FTC</a> regarding their Game Pass price hike, which doesn't exactly spell good news for Microsoft.</p>
