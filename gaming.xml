		<p>While it might be the weekend, news waits for no one, and this Saturday the latest out of Sega is that arena fighter Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is all set to release this summer on the 5th of August, 2025. As part of the announcement, they also dropped a brand new trailer, showcasing how the District Art Area is depicted in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-wait-for-fable-play-fable-2-instead<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Buried like some kind of cursed treasure at the bottom of this week’s episode of the official Xbox Podcast was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay">news about Playground Games’ long-awaited Fable</a>. I call it “treasure” because it included a rare glimpse at gameplay, but “cursed” because it came with that dreaded caveat that accompanies so many development updates: a delay. Once planned to launch this year, Fable is now set for a 2026 release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delays, of course, are generally not harbingers of doom, despite the agonising wait they inflict. In Fable’s case, hopefully this is the sign of a richly detailed world that just needs more time to bloom. But that extra year of waiting can be put to good use: there’s no better time to play the Fable games. Specifically, I’d urge you to try Fable 2, the series’ highpoint, and (re)discover just what a strange and unique RPG Lionhead Studios’ 2008 classic is. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By today’s role-playing game standards, Fable 2 is really quite unusual. But even compared to its 2008 contemporaries, which includes the likes of Fallout 3 (released just days later) and BioWare’s early 3D games, it is practically singular in its vision. While Fable 2 features a fairly traditional campaign structure, with a linear main story and an esoteric collection of optional side quests, its RPG systems are a far cry from the crunchy stat blocks of Oblivion and Neverwinter Nights. It completely smooths out those aspects to create something incredibly approachable, even for those who find a D&amp;D character sheet indistinguishable from hieroglyphics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just six main skills govern the likes of your health pool, strength, and speed. There’s only a single damage stat to consider when it comes to weapons, and nothing of the sort when it comes to armour or buff-providing accessories. Combat, despite being prevalent throughout most quests, is incredibly surface swashbuckling, spiced up only through the use of some genuinely creative spellcasting (including the wonderful Chaos, which forces enemies to dance and scrub the floors.) You’re even imperious to death – losing all your hitpoints is punished with nothing more than a minor XP penalty. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fable 2 is the RPG for people who have never played RPGs before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Fable 2 is the RPG for people who have never played RPGs before. Back in 2008, when Oblivion’s open world Cyrodiil may have felt overwhelmingly huge and imposingly freeform for role-playing newbies, Fable 2’s Albion offered a more manageable chain of small, easy-to-navigate maps. You can freely go back and forth between these areas and, with the aid of your faithful canine companion who barks at the merest sign of adventure, you can tread beyond the beaten path to discover secrets like buried treasure, sunken caves, and the puzzle-posing Demon Doors. All this lends the world a sense of scale and opportunity grander than its actual footprint. But Albion’s geography is restrictive, largely forcing you down linear pathways from one landmark to another. This isn’t a world to get lost in, at least not in the traditional sense of the word.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Albion as a physical entity pales in comparison to the incredible worlds of BioWare’s Infinity Engine games and Bethesda’s wonderfully weird Morrowind. But to judge it on both modern and contemporary expectations of RPGs is to do it a disservice. Fable 2’s priorities lie not in climbing far-off mountains or spelunking through dungeons with a myriad of routes, but in a world that is bustling with life. Look at Fable 2 through the lens of a very different game – Maxis’ similarly singular The Sims – and you’ll find a truly remarkable simulation of society.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/fable-2-town-1740756088967.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The town of Bowerstone is full of simulated, authentic life. | Image credit: Lionhead Studios / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Albion operates like some kind of strange organic clockwork organism. Every morning, as the sun peeks over the horizon, its people wake and start their daily routines. Town criers bellow updates over the noisy crowds: “Shops are now opening!” and, when the stars begin to twinkle once more, “The time is: very late!” Much like your families in The Sims, every citizen of Albion has an interior life, driven by not just their societal roles, but also their likes and dislikes. Through the use of an ever-expanding library of gestures, you can delight, insult, impress, or even seduce every (non-hostile) person you encounter. A well-executed fart may have the patrons of a pub howling into their beers, while pointing and laughing at small children may send them fleeing for their parents. Through these emotes you can push and pull the people of Albion, charming them with your heroism and eccentricities, or pushing them away with your evil deeds and rudeness. We often talk about reactive NPCs and video game cities that feel alive, but there’s simply nothing out there that achieves those goals in quite the same way as Fable 2.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your character is a Hero with a capital H, destined to go on grand adventures, bully bandits, and find glittering treasure, Fable 2 is a more interesting game when you fully assimilate yourself into its society. Pretty much every building in Albion is available for purchase, both houses and shops, and you can buy them with the money earned by toiling away at gainful employment (the woodcutting and blacksmithing minigames quickly become monotonous-yet-soothing distractions.) With the keys to a house in hand, you can either become a landlord, renting the property out for fair or extortionate prices, or make the building your home and furnish it to your tastes. Then there’s the next step: wooing the most attractive NPC in town by repeatedly spamming their favourite emote until they fall into your bed and, after a comedic bit of slap and tickle, you end up with a baby. The individual components of all this, as with The Sims, feels incredibly artificial. Yet the overall result produces a genuine, remarkable sense of life. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A well-executed fart may have the patrons of a pub howling into their beers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Few, if any, RPGs have followed in Fable’s footsteps in this department. Even the towering achievements of Baldur’s Gate 3 don’t include organic romances and the ability to game the property market. But Albion’s authentic sense of life does exist in a more unexpected successor: Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar’s digital recreation of the old West is incredibly responsive, filled with incidental characters that believably react to your presence and behaviour. Every single NPC can be spoken to using a system that feels like a slicker, more cinematic version of Fable 2’s gestures, and your demeanor can delight or annoy. While most interactions are simple pleasantries, the lives you touch in more meaningful ways – such as sucking the venom out of a lethal snake bite – may remember you and repay you with kindness many weeks later. If Playground’s new Fable is to stay true to its origins, then its modern touchstone should be Rockstar’s unparalleled living world rather than the tabletop-inspired RPGs that are currently in vogue.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other mandatory things Playground will need to foster, too. Fable’s incredibly British sense of humour needs to be maintained, and so we’d best be seeing some dry, witty satire of the class system with a healthy dose of bum jokes on the side. Plus we’ll need a cast of beloved thespians that rival the teaching staff of Hogwarts (something Playground already seems to have under control, with Richard Ayoade and Matt King appearing in trailers.) But perhaps the most important, beyond that bustling world, is Lionhead’s trademark approach to good and evil. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/fable-2-forest-troll-1740756268280.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fable 2's combat is simple, but its enemy designs are gorgeous reinterpretations of fantasy staples. | Image credit: Lionhead Studios / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Peter Molyneux, the founder of Lionhead Studios and lead designer of the Fable series, has a fascination with good and evil. Providing players a choice between the two was the basis of the studio’s first project, the god game Black &amp; White, and continued to be a focus throughout the rest of Molyneux’s career, including his upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-a-new-spin-on-fables-world-from-its-original-creator-gamescom-2024">Masters of Albion</a> (which is unrelated to Fable, despite its confusing name.) But Lionhead’s approach to player choice is a far cry from the nuanced, tough decisions featured in The Witcher and the best works of BioWare. In Fable 2, your options are either absolutely angelic or despicably demonic, with no grey space in between. It works in comedic extremes; an early sidequest asks you to either clear the pests out of a trader’s warehouse or destroy all his stock. Later, a ghost who killed himself after being abandoned at the altar asks that you torment his still-living former lover, and your only paths are to make her life a living hell or make her your wife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past decade and change of RPG development has placed priority on ultimate player expression, unlocked through choices that explore a spectrum of human behaviour. Moral quandaries, we’ve decided, should be much more complicated than the choice between saving children or burning them alive. Fable, though, thrives on the binary. It relishes the chance for you to play the most heroic hero the land ever saw, or become the most heinous villain in history. This was established in the trilogy’s first game, which saw your character literally grow devil horns if you persistently chose evil options, but really came into its own in Fable 2. The way the sequel’s quests branch to offer good or evil pathways feels richer and more creative, while that reactive world allows both your moment-to-moment and week-to-week activities to shape your reputation and purity alignment. Moral-focused outcomes in RPGs can often feel underwhelming because they place increased resources on the centre rather than the extremes, and so being truly evil ultimately feels like saving the world with a scowl. Fable 2, on the other hand, is happy for you to go full Sith (with the lightning powers to match) and it largely works because it only has two paths to juggle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not yet clear if Playground Games will get this side of Fable right. While this week’s development update came with 50 seconds of pre-alpha gameplay footage, there was little in there that truly painted the picture of an authentic Fable game. Well, aside from the mandatory chicken kick, of course. But under a minute of contextless footage was never going to tell the whole story, was it? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we can see in those fleeting seconds is a much more detailed world than Fable has ever enjoyed. The main character’s horse points to an open world with far fewer restrictions than the 360-era games, and an incredibly rendered forest suggests that we genuinely will be able to get lost in this new Albion. But it's the brief shot of a city, which looks dense and knotty and full of life, that gives me hope that Playground Games have stuck true to the Sims-like simulation of society that makes Fable 2 so unique. I can’t wait to point and laugh at its children, dance on its pubs’ tables, and have a whirlwind romance with a randomer I meet behind the green grocers.        </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all of that is a year away. And in that time you can revisit (or experience for the first time) the wonderful world of Fable 2. You’ll easily see why it’s so beloved, and why it’s so important that Playground Games retains all of its oddities. Because what we don’t need from this project is a Fable reimagined as a Witcher clone, or as a Baldur’s Gate-alike, or Dragon Age style RPG. We just need Fable to be Fable, farts and all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty boasts one of the most popular esports ecosystems in the business. From the Call of Duty League to Challengers, and from the Esports World Cup to the many grassroots events that pop up every year, the competitive scene has plenty of meat on the bones. Many players front the esports landscape, but which of them can be considered the best Call of Duty players around?</p>



<p>In this breakdown, I’ll highlight the top COD pro players you should be watching this year. It’s an ever-changing scene, but the top dogs are usually the same year in, year out – at least until they retire, that is.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about the ten best Call of Duty players in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-best-cod-players">Who Are The Best COD Players?</h2>



<p>As a preface, I’ll highlight that I’m talking <strong>only </strong>about players in the Call of Duty League in this guide. This list won’t touch on the best Warzone players in the business. I’m all about the CDL in this piece!</p>



<p><strong>In no particular order</strong>, let’s talk about the best Call of Duty players in the game <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chris-simp-lehr">Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.8 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Simp is a tried and tested competitor with some of the most stunning achievements in the scene. He was a prodigy who started competing from a young age, breaking into the CWL in 2019 and winning the COD Championship as one of the freshest faces ever to do it.</p>



<p>He went on to win another ring in 2021 after one of the most incredible seasons in the business, showing remarkable domination through the Cold War year. He has flown the Atlanta FaZe banner proudly since 2019 and is one of the most recognisable forces in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Simp’s talents on the sticks are second to none. Time and again, he proves himself to be one of the most technically proficient players in the game, and despite his relatively quiet demeanour, he’s an utter animal with some of the best thumbs in esports.</p>



<p>In 2025, Simp has already claimed a Major chip and a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<h3 id="h-thomas-scrappy-ernst">Thomas ‘Scrappy’ Ernst</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$507,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>Scrap entered the Call of Duty League scene as one of the most electrifying, controversial rookies, going on a crusade against some of the biggest and most beloved veterans in the business. The loudmouthed competitor could back up his bark with his bite, though. He quickly established himself as one of the straightest shooters in the game.</p>



<p>In his opening season with Toronto Ultra, Scrap claimed a Major chip and came close to netting a world championship title but was stopped in his tracks by the New York Subliners. Since then, Scrap has earned another chip and wound up in third place at his second COD Champs event.</p>



<p>In 2025, Ernst finds himself occupying a spot on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/">the LA Thieves ‘Super Team’</a>, and he’s already flying in Black Ops 6. He fell ever so slightly short of first place at Major I but has already proven himself as one of the most dominating players and a budding IGL in the 2025 CDL season.</p>



<p>It helps that he has mellowed a bit, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-mcarthur-cellium-jovel">McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.6 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Cellium lives and breathes competitive Call of Duty. As one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, Cellium is the epitome of talent on the sticks, and everything from his movement to his accuracy is top-notch.</p>



<p>Alongside Simp, Cellium has won a COD Champs ring, the top prize at the inaugural Esports World Cup, and has claimed several chips over the last few years. He’s a beloved character with a quirky personality, and his skills are almost unparalleled. </p>



<p>Cellium started strong in 2025, netting a win <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/">at the first Major in Madrid</a> <strong>and </strong>the CDL Minor I tournament. With multiple spots as an MVP and an All-Star, Cellium has a stellar record and even more potential to land another ring in the future – perhaps in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro">Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>OpTic Texas</p>



<p>In 2024, Shotzzy went on a burner along with the rest of OpTic Texas, netting a win at Major III and then securing a massive victory at COD Champs, beating the New York Subliners with a 5 – 1 scoreline. That earned Shotzzy his second ring in Call of Duty, following on from his 2020 win with Dallas Empire.</p>



<p>Shotzzy is one of the most popular Call of Duty players around, and his charm and rizz are undeniable. He’s one of the stalwarts of the OpTic Texas roster and is a fan-favourite, but it helps that he’s an animal of the game with some of the best movement in the business.</p>



<p>The OpTic Texas team had a slow start to the 2025 season, which wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">helped by roster changes</a>, but Shotzzy is very much at home in Black Ops 6, thanks to the ‘omnimovement’ mechanics.</p>



<p>As a side note, Shotzzy has a prestigious place in the world of esports. He’s one of just two pro players in the world to have earned a world championship title in <strong>two games</strong> – Halo and Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-isaiah-gwinn-gwinn">Isaiah ‘Gwinn’ Gwinn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$63,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Carolina Royal Ravens</p>



<p>Gwinn is a stunning prospect and one of the most talented young players in the Call of Duty pro scene. He broke into the Carolina Royal Ravens roster towards the end of 2023 and has been a recognisable face in the squad ever since, but this year, he has blown up.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers, Gwinn has started strong. He ranks high in almost every category – kills, captures, hill time, first bloods, and so on. His talents were a pivotal part of the Royal Ravens seeing immense success early in the season, with the team putting up some of the best numbers right off the bat.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/royal-ravens-on-top-cdl-2025-season/">The Royal Ravens</a> even handed Atlanta FaZe the team’s first 0 – 3 loss in two years.</p>



<p>The dominance persisted into Major I, with Carolina eliminating Vegas, OpTic, and Toronto from the Madrid tournament without too much fuss. It’s a team effort to be sure, but Gwinn is outperforming his teammates, including veteran talents SlasheR and TJHaly, in most respects.</p>



<h3 id="h-zack-drazah-jordan">Zack ‘Drazah’ Jordan</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$903,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Drazah can be a hit-and-miss player at times, but he’s been more hit than miss recently. As one of the cockiest players in the Call of Duty League, Drazah has been forced to put his money where his mouth is on numerous occasions, and sometimes, the trash talk hasn’t paid off – but he’s on a streak right now and it’s working well for him.</p>



<p>At the tail end of the 2022 season, Drazah found his feet, netting the trophy in Major IV and then scooping the COD Championship while representing the LA Thieves. He went on to win Major IV again the next season and then relocated to Atlanta FaZe’s starting roster.</p>



<p>From there, things moved on in earnest for Drazah. The AR who once dubbed himself the best SnD player in the world has since won a further two chips under FaZe, as well as a CDL Minor <strong>and </strong>the Esports World Cup. Flanked by the likes of Cellium, aBeZy, and Simp, Drazah could easily come out on top in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-paco-hydra-rusiewiez">Paco ‘HyDra’ Rusiewiez</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$742,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>HyDra is one of the superstars of the Call of Duty League and has been since he surfaced on the New yok Subliners in 2021, slipping under Clayster’s wing and making a name for himself. He’s known as the ‘French Phenom’ for good reason.</p>



<p>In the years since HyDra entered the Call of Duty League, he has won a Pro-Am, three Major tournaments, and a world championship title. He was a part of the New York Subliners roster that devastated the CDL in 2023, winning two Majors and COD Champs. That COD Champs grand final was <strong>historic</strong>, with the Subliners hitting a 5 – 0 scoreline in record time.</p>



<p>Paco has since joined the LA Thieves and is working as an integral part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/la-thieves-cdl-super-team/">the ‘Super Team’ assembled by Nadeshot</a>. He’s been a little sticky to kick off the CDL 2025 season, but his ceiling is almost unparalleled, and he has some solid players around him.</p>



<p>Last season, HyDra ended up with a second-place finish at Champs, and he’s eager for a redemption story this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-tyler-abezy-pharris">Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.8 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Adding aBeZy to this list means that every member of the Atlanta FaZe squad has made it here, but it <strong>just makes sense</strong>. This team has built up so much chemistry over the years that it’s almost unstoppable, and the wins come thick and fast for the squad.</p>



<p>ABeZy is one of the most dependable Call of Duty players in the CDL, and like Simp, he broke into the competitive scene as a prodigy. With Lehr, Pharris makes up the other half of ‘The Tiny Terrors’ on Atlanta FaZe.</p>



<p>In 2025, aBeZy has already claimed wins at both a Major and a Minor, and in 2024, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-cod-esports-world-cup/">snatched the Esports World Cup win</a> with ease – plus he added another chip to his collection. He was a part of the FaZe roster that dominated the Cold War season, putting up some of the best numbers in competitive COD history.</p>



<p>By numbers, aBeZy is the highest-earning COD pro player in the world, and he has so much left in the tank for the years ahead.</p>



<h3 id="h-dan-ghosty-rothe">Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$267,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>Ghosty is another member of the LA Thieves ‘Super Team’, a talented IGL with undeniable skills and a charming persona. He’s a likeable player with intense abilities in-game, represented nicely by the attributes he’s secured in a relatively short time in the CDL.</p>



<p>Ghosty’s first shot in the CDL came with OpTic Texas, and from there, he joined the LA Thieves. Nadeshot used Ghosty to build up a team featuring HyDra, Scrappy, and Envoy, and the play has been like clockwork ever since.</p>



<p>While an ultimate victory has escaped Ghosty thus far, his first big win is inching ever closer. In 2024, he landed in second place at the Esports World Cup and has been within spitting distance of netting a chip at a couple of Major tournaments. His in-game skills are front and centre, and the execution to secure a trophy could come during the 2025 season. </p>



<h3 id="h-brandon-dashy-otell">Brandon ‘Dashy’ Otell</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$788,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>OpTic Texas</p>



<p>Dashy is one of the best beamers in the business, boasting ethereal thumbs and the ability to never miss a shot. For that alone, he earns a place on this list of the best Call of Duty players in 2025, but his accolades speak for themselves.</p>



<p>In 2024, Dashy won the Call of Duty League Championship with OpTic Texas, securing his first ring after several years of playing at the highest level. He has the best team possible around him now, and the chemistry is on another level. The future is looking bright for Dashy, and he’s an integral part of one of the biggest brands in esports.</p>



<p>OpTic Texas isn’t in the <strong>best place </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/">to start the season</a>, but there’s plenty of time to right the ship and start securing chips.</p>



<p>Do you think another competitor deserves a spot on this list of the best Call of Duty players in 2025? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>A little over 20 years ago, Valve was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">getting ready to release a new <em>Half-Life</em> game</a>. At the same time, the company <a href="https://www.bluesnews.com/a/337/valve-unveils-steam-at-2002-game-developer-s-conference">was trying to push Steam</a> as a new option for players to download and update games over the Internet.</p>
<p>Requiring Steam in order to play <em>Half-Life 2</em> led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">plenty of grumbling from players</a> in 2004. But the high-profile Steam exclusive helped build an instant user base for Valve's fresh distribution system, setting it on a path to eventually become the unquestioned leader in the space. The link between the new game and the new platform helped promote a bold alternative to the retail game sales and distribution systems that had dominated PC gaming for decades.</p>

<p>Today, all indications suggest that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">Valve is getting ready to release a new Half-Life game</a>. At the same time, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">is getting ready to push SteamOS</a> as a new option for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">third-party hardware makers</a> and individual users to "download and test themselves."</p>
<p>Requiring SteamOS to play <em>Half-Life 3</em> would definitely lead to a lot of grumbling from players. But the high-profile exclusive could help build an instant user base for Valve's fresh operating system, perhaps setting it on the path to become the unquestioned leader in the space. A link between the new game and the new platform could help promote a bold alternative to the Windows-based systems that have dominated PC gaming for decades.</p>
<h2>Not another Steam Machine</h2>
<p>Getting players to change the established platform they use to buy and play games (either in terms of hardware or software) usually requires some sort of instantly apparent benefit for the player. Those benefits can range from the tangible (e.g., an improved controller, better graphics performance) to the ancillary (e.g., social features, achievements) to the downright weird (e.g., a second screen on a portable). Often, though, a core reason why players switch platforms is for access to exclusive "system seller" games that aren't available any other way.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s role in popularizing early Steam shows just how much a highly anticipated exclusive can convince otherwise reluctant players to invest time and effort in a new platform. To see what can happen without such an exclusive, we only need to look to Valve's 2015 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/first-steam-machines-steam-link-controller-hit-stores-november-10/">launch of the Steam Machine hardware line</a>, powered by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/valve-announces-linux-based-steamos-as-basis-for-living-room-gaming/">the first version of the Linux-based SteamOS</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, Valve was selling SteamOS mainly as an alternative to a new Windows 8 environment <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/steams-newell-windows-8-catastrophe-driving-valve-to-embrace-linux/">that Valve co-founder Gabe Newell saw as a "catastrophe" in the making</a> for the PC gaming world. Newell described SteamOS as a "hedging strategy" against Microsoft's potential ability to force all Windows 8 app distribution through the Windows Store, a la Apple's total control of iPhone app distribution.</p>
<p>When Microsoft failed to impose that kind of hegemonic control over Windows apps and games, Valve was left with little else to convince players that it was worth buying a Windows-free Steam Machine (or going through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/everything-you-need-to-know-to-install-steamos-on-your-very-own-computer/">the onerous process of installing the original SteamOS</a> on their gaming rigs). Sure, using SteamOS meant saving a few bucks on a Windows license. But it also meant being stuck with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/the-state-of-linux-gaming-in-the-steamos-era/">an extremely limited library of Linux ports</a> (especially when it came to releases from major publishers) and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/">poor technical performance compared to Windows</a> even when those ports were available.</p>
<p>Given those obvious downsides—and the lack of any obvious upsides—it's no wonder that users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">overwhelmingly ignored SteamOS and Steam Machines</a> at the time. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/analysis-can-steamos-drag-the-pc-game-industry-over-to-linux/">as we argued way back in 2013</a>, a major exclusive on the scale of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 3</em> could have convinced a lot of gamers to overlook at least some of those downsides and give the new platform a chance.</p>

<h2>A little push</h2>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the modern version of SteamOS is in a much better place than the Steam Machine-era version ever was. That's thanks in large part to Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">consistent work</a> on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/valves-steam-play-uses-vulkan-to-bring-more-windows-games-to-linux/">Proton compatibility layer</a>, which lets the Linux-based SteamOS run almost any game that's designed for Windows (with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">only a few major exceptions</a>). That wide compatibility has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/valve-promises-steam-deck-will-run-the-entire-steam-library-at-30-fps/">a huge boon for the Steam Deck</a>, which offered many players easy handheld access to vast swathes of PC gaming for the first time. The Steam Deck also showed off SteamOS's major user interface and user experience benefits over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">clunkier Windows-based gaming portables</a>.</p>

<p>Still, the benefits of switching from Windows to SteamOS might seem a bit amorphous to many players today. If Valve is really interested in pushing its OS as an alternative to Windows gaming, a big exclusive game is just the thing to convince a critical mass of players to make the leap. And when it comes to massive PC gaming exclusives, it doesn't get much bigger than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">the long, long-awaited <em>Half-Life 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>We know it might sound ludicrous to suggest that Valve's biggest game in years should ignore the Windows platform that's been used by practically every PC gamer for decades. Keep in mind, though, that there would be nothing stopping existing Windows gamers from downloading and installing a free copy of the Linux-based SteamOS (likely on a separate drive or partition) to get access to <em>Half-Life 3</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, installing a new operating system (especially one based on Linux) is not exactly a plug-and-play process. But Valve has a long history of streamlining game downloads, updates, and driver installations through Steam itself. If anyone can make the process of setting up a new OS relatively seamless, it's Valve.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>And let's not forget that millions of gamers already have easy access to SteamOS through Steam Deck hardware. Those aging Steam Decks might not be powerful enough to run a game like <em>Half-Life 3</em> at maximum graphics settings, but Valve games have a history of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601540333">scaling down well</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li4s-RUCzQs">low-end systems</a>.</p>
<p>Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">leaked "Powered by SteamOS" initiative</a> also seems poised to let third-party hardware makers jump in with more powerful (and more <em>Half-Life 3-</em>capable) desktops, laptops, and handhelds with SteamOS pre-installed. And that's before we even consider the potential impact of a more powerful "Steam Deck 2," which Valve's Pierre-Loup&nbsp; Griffais <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/valves-leaked-steam-deck-model-1030-probably-isnt-a-full-version-2-0/">said in 2023</a> could potentially come in "the next couple of years."</p>
<h2>Time for a bold move</h2>
<p>Tying a major game like&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 3</em> to a completely new and largely untested operating system would surely lead to some deafening pushback from gamers happy with the Windows-based status quo. An exclusive release could also be risky if SteamOS ends up showing some technical problems as it tries to grow past its Steam Deck roots (Linux <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/problems-youll-likely-run-into-gaming-on-linux/">doesn't exactly have the best track record</a> when it comes to things like game driver compatibility across different hardware).</p>

<p>Despite all that, we're pretty confident that the vast majority of players interested in <em>Half-Life 3</em> would jump through a few OS-related hoops to get access to the game. And many of those players would likely stick with Valve's gaming-optimized OS going forward rather than spending money on another Windows license.</p>
<p>Even a timed exclusivity window for <em>Half-Life 3 </em>on SteamOS could push a lot of early adopters to see what all the fuss is about without excluding those who refuse to switch away from Windows. Failing even that, maybe a non-exclusive <em>Half-Life 3</em> could be included as a pre-installed freebie with future versions of SteamOS, as an incentive for the curious to try out a new operating system.</p>
<p>With the coming wide release of SteamOS, Valve has a rare opportunity to upend the PC gaming OS dominance that Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">more or less stumbled into decades ago</a>. A game like <em>Half-Life 3</em> could be just the carrot needed to get PC gaming as a whole over its longstanding Windows dependence.</p>

		<p>I’ve never quite been clear when you’re allowed to break out the ol’ “pinch, punch, first of the month”. The rules always seem to be quite inconsistent. Is it any 1st of the month, or is it only from October onwards? And do you have to stop by midday, like with April Fools?</p>
<p>Anyway, spring has officially sprung, meteorologically speaking, and even though it’s still distinctly chilly a lot of the time, I’m definitely feeling the seasons shift. But this past week has seen the last throes of winter game launches, and one of the biggest games of the year is upon us all.</p>

<p>This week was all about Monster Hunter Wilds… or was it? That game is a truly fantastic new entry in what has become one of the biggest game franchise going, but there’s also the great new Two Point Museum, if you’d rather curate bones than hunt the creatures that own them…</p>

		<p>Stardock has announced that it will be releasing the first paid DLC for Sins of a Solar Empire 2 on March 27th, and that DLC is called Path to Power. This new content will add more than 10 new scenario maps for players to navigate, with new objectives to tackle from defending your territory to assimilating other races into your own empire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sins of a Solar Empire II | Steam Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sbOAP-wKfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The ‘Paths to Power’ DLC lays the foundation for new, more dynamic styles of gameplay in the Sins’ universe,”</em> said Brian Clair, Executive Producer at Stardock. <em>“Not only will players get new experiences from this DLC, but modders will gain access to a whole new set of options to bring their creations to life.”</em></p>
<p>Three of the scenarios are ‘All As One’, ‘Defend the Homeworld, and ‘Scorched Space.’ In the ‘All As One’ scenario players take control of the Vasari Alliance which is facing a catastrophic event with planets disintegrating as an unknown force moves through the darkness. The objective is to escape but to do that the Vasari Alliance will need to gather resources and forge new relationships with other factions to help them. In ‘Defend the Homeworld’, players play as Pranast United which is under attack. There is no victory condition, as victory is impossible. The only goal is to see how long you can survive the waves of attack. In the ‘Scorched Space’ scenario, a new star system has been found that contains the remnants of an unknown race. There are two options in this scenario. Restore this lost technology for your own use, or destroy it to keep it out of the hands of other factions.</p>

<p>The paid content is not all that will be coming to Sins of a Solar Empire 2. Update 1.4 will change the relationship between population and culture, with a larger population making your empire more influential in the grand scheme of the game. There will be new units added as well and some balance changes too. Paths of Power has been priced at $12.99, but is also part of the Content Pass and the Premium edition at no additional cost.</p>

<p>Free Fire is one of the best and most popular mobile games ever. It has hundreds of millions of fans worldwide and is one of the only games to hit one billion digital downloads.

<h2 id="h-how-to-use-free-fire-redeem-codes-for-diamonds">How to Use Free Fire Redeem Codes For Diamonds</h2>



<p>If you’ve managed to find a Free Fire redeem code, which appear online all the time, you’ll need to use a special site to redeem it.

<p>The best way to get redeem codes for Free Fire is to follow as many related channels as possible on social media. That means watching official channels as well as following content creators, who may be periodically rewarded with codes that they can hand out to their viewers.</p>

Many fans are especially vocal against the idea of Space Marines 2 turning into a live-service game, especially after Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive introduced community events seemingly as the only way to get desirable items that are only available for a limited time. This time, the pushback has been so intense that Focus has apologized to fans and assured them that a live-service transformation isn't in the cards for Space Marines 2.</p><p>In this week's <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">community update</a>, Focus Entertainment shared the following statement: "We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items. We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live-service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone."</p><p>"However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far," added Focus. "We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining."</p><p>As a way to make it up to fans, the emblem-less Mk VIII Errant Helmet will now be available for free to all players who link their PROS account to Space Marine 2. Before this change, the helmet was only going to be given to players who had victories in each of the six classes in Operations mode before the Imperial Vigil community event came to an end.</p><p>Earlier this year, Focus Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-will-get-several-substantial-updates-in-2025/1100-6529135/" data-ref-id="1100-6529135">shared its roadmap for Space Marine 2's "substantial" updates</a> throughout 2025. Outside of the game, Amazon Prime Video's Warhammer 40,000 live-action series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/" data-ref-id="1100-6528340">may finally be going forward</a> with Henry Cavill in a leading role.</p>

Game Club, a new segment for podcast Beyond! where each month we will be picking games to play as a group and talking about our experiences as we progress through them. The games will range from various classics to quintessential PlayStation games we consider must plays, and even revisiting some recent favorites to prepare for upcoming sequels (looking at you Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei)! However, for March we decided it would be a great time to revisit one of our favorite superhero games of all time: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been at least 10 years since many of us dove into 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and now feels like the perfect time to revisit the game that almost singlehandedly revitalized the superhero genre. Whether it was the excellent freeform combat of snapping back and forth between enemies with precision, to unleashing devastating kicks or takedowns, or the way it trained our detective skills to solve the numerous riddles by the Riddler – Arkham Asylum gave us the best depiction (for its time) of Batman and what it would be like to wear the cowl.  
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Beyond! team is eager to dive back into this amazing game, and over the month of March we will be talking about it weekly on each episode of the podcast as well as updating this column with our thoughts and hope that you will all do the same in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Nobody can lose their shit and start yelling quite like Gene Hackman. The actor, who was discovered dead in his home at the age of 95 this week (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under bizarre-sounding circumstances</a></span>), appeared in dozens of movies and won two Oscars. He did comedies, thrillers, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one kids movie</a></span>. He was also the best Lex Luthor we’ve ever had. </p><p>We took the occasion of his passing to look back at some of his best movies. There are of course the all-time classics like <em>French Connection</em> and <em>The Conversation</em> in which Hackman showed his range, subtlety, and fierceness.  But there’s also the more obscure thrillers like <em>No Way Out</em> in which he plays a Secretary of Defense caught up in a murder plot investigated by Kevin Costner. I watched it last night and my interest ebbed and flowed until the last 30 minutes cemented it as one of my favorite political thrillers from the era. </p><p>Sam Raimi’s <em>The Quick and the Dead</em>, a Western in which Hackman plays a diabolical sheriff opposite an all-star cast that includes Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio, also comes highly recommended. I’m putting it on this weekend. Here are seven of our other favorite Hackman movies. </p></div></div><div><p>Richard Donner’s 1978 <em>Superman </em>is not only the first modern-day superhero blockbuster; it’s one of the few enduringly great superhero movies, and that’s due in large part to its ebullience. It’s just a fun, joyful movie, radiating classic comic-book enthusiasm and energy from start to finish. And Gene Hackman’s portrayal of Superman’s archnemesis Lex Luthor is an essential part of that. Here’s the key to Hackman’s version of Luthor: he really seems to be enjoying himself. He’s constantly delighted by his own evil ingenuity, explaining his nefarious schemes to Superman with obvious glee while Christopher Reeve, as the Man of Steel, looks on disapprovingly with that wholesome, Boy Scout stare of his. If anything, Hackman’s Luthor is only more fascinating today than ever, as so many of us feel the ways in which we’re at the mercy of oligarchs who view the world as their own personal plaything, something to be manipulated and destroyed for their gain, no matter the cost to millions of others. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a></span></p></div><div><p>The 1970s are when Hackman established himself as not just a great actor but a movie star capable of carrying a film on his own, with acclaimed performances like his Oscar-winning turn in <em>The French Connection </em>and his legendary work as surveillance expert Henry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>The Conversation</em>. But my favorite Hackman film from this period is <em>Night Moves</em>, a morally slippery, sun-dappled Hollywood neo-noir from <em>Bonnie and Clyde </em>director Arthur Penn. Hackman is at his most enjoyably complex here as Harry Moseby, a football player turned private eye who’s hired by an aging actress to find her missing teenage daughter Delly, played by Melanie Griffith. As his pursuit of Delly takes him into the shadowy underbelly of the film industry and beyond, Moseby is also coming apart at the seams due to problems in his marriage. Be warned, you won’t find a traditional whodunit and a conventionally satisfying conclusion here; <em>Night Moves </em>has other things on its mind. It’s a distinctly 1970s American film—disillusioned, ambiguous, rich with character and fantastic dialogue—and it demonstrates why Hackman was an ideal actor for this fascinating era in American cinema. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCM</a></span></p></div><div><p><em>The Birdcage </em>is a ‘90s comedy starring Nathan Lane and Robin Williams as a gay couple in Miami who pretend to be straight to deceive a conservative senator in order to help their son who is trying to marry the politician’s daughter. It’s a very funny movie that feels ahead of its time in a lot of ways for how it depicts LGBTQ people.</p><p>And here’s how good Gene Hackman is at acting and being funny: He’s able to stand out and deliver a memorable performance in a movie starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. That’s impressive. So many other actors playing (literally) the straight man in a wacky comedy like <em>The Birdcage</em> would have disappeared and been overshadowed completely by the zany leads and their incredible onscreen chemistry. But not Hackman, who plays Republican senator Kevin Keely perfectly as a believably grumpy conservative who’s put into a very uncomfortable situation and comes out the other side somewhat changed. And Hackman’s comedic chops are on full display, especially in scenes featuring Lane. Track this one down and watch it ASAP.  — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Birdcage-Robin-Williams/dp/B004AZKI6W?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/gene-hackman-movies-stream-hoosiers-enemy-state-1851767152&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B004AZKI6W" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Prime Video</a></span></p></div><div><p>Few things in cinema are as pleasurable as seeing two towering actors butt heads in a film with a whip-smart script that gives their clash real stakes. The actors have never been better, and the stakes never higher, than they are in <em>Crimson Tide</em>, Tony Scott’s 1995 submarine-set pressure cooker in which a commanding officer (Hackman) and his executive officer (Denzel Washington) clash, with a potential nuclear crisis hanging in the balance. <em>Crimson Tide </em>is irresistibly compelling for so many reasons: the complexity of its lead performances, the circumstances that drive these men to collide, and the intelligence with which it engages with the nuclear threat. As Washington’s character puts it at one point, “In the nuclear world, the true enemy can’t be destroyed…in my humble opinion, in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.” Hackman is pitch-perfect as the cigar-chomping human embodiment of the opposition to this idea, an old-school navy officer with the capacity to kick off World War III. — Carolyn Petit </p><p>  <strong>Where to stream it:</strong> Rent or buy it</p></div><div><p>I’m not a big sports movie guy, but I’m a big fan of <em>Hoosiers, </em>and a big reason for that is<em> </em>Gene Hackman’s powerful performance as high school basketball coach Norman Dale. What I particularly like about Hackman in <em>Hoosiers </em>is that he nails the power and ferocity that tough coaches in high school tend to have, but he never seems like a jerk. In fact, he’s someone you root for just as much as the team of misfits he’s leading. Even if you don’t watch basketball or like sports, check out <em>Hoosiers </em>to see Hackman doing what he does best and proving that he was one of the greats. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p>Will Smith in his prime opposite a seasoned, paranoid Gene Hackman made <em>Enemy of the State</em> an instant classic. Hackman has always felt like an old actor, but he rarely got to play one. <em>Enemy of the State </em>let him school an electric Smith on the emerging surveillance state with grizzled wisdom and curmudgeonly charm. Plus the movie’s MacGuffin is a digital camera recording wedged into a Game Boy, because all technology is fun and whimsical until it accidentally implicates you in a conspiratorial coverup. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p><em>The Royal Tenenbaums </em>isn’t director Wes Andersen’s best movie but it’s certainly his most watchable, possibly because Hackman forced him to make it that way. It was his third-to-last movie appearance and one of his most charismatic, letting him seamlessly shift between humor and drama, dry, sardonic line deliveries and heartfelt admissions that land like an ocean liner. Hackman r<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eportedly hated making the movie</a></span>, which probably made it all the better. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By far the biggest, most disheartening industry news of the week was <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WB’s sudden closure of three studios</a>, including Monolith, creators of classics like <em>Blood</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>. While swinging the scythe and taking out Monolith’s much-anticipated <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, the company said it’s now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turning its focus</a> to “fewer but bigger franchises.” On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about why this strategy – which might make line go up in the short term – is ultimately a dead end.</p><p>We begin the episode by accidentally bursting the dam on another wellspring of Riley Lore – perhaps the wildest yet – before we all move on to a discussion of more sobering matters: the closure of Monolith and two other WB-owned studios. WB, of course, has proven especially eager to <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumpster promising projects</a> beyond the world of games in recent years, but what portion of this sickness is specific to the company and where does it overlap with the gaming industry’s own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mismanagement epidemic</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about Jeff Bezos’ mask-off decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transform The Washington Post into the propaganda arm</a> of his already-unimaginably-profitable business empire, the latest in a line of tech billionaires bending the knee to tired old king Donald Trump and cackling vizier Elon Musk. Speaking of workplaces that suck, we also discuss <em>Severance</em>, a show that <a href="https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely does not suck</a>. It has the trappings of a mystery box, but so far, it has successfully maintained a focus on characters above all else. Fantastic! Keep it up! Please do not become another <em>Lost </em>or <em>Westworld</em>! Finally, we suggest games that would be improved by the addition of a Nemesis System (basically all of them; <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuck WB</a> for patenting it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can add a Nemesis System to Aftermath’s comments section.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think now we’re finally reaching a point where we’re seeing more misfires than regular fires. At some point, the industry’s gonna have to change course. But Warner’s going further in this direction: fewer, bigger franchises. Destined to fail. No doubt in my mind, that shit’s not gonna work out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I hate to reup the <em>Avowed </em>conversation, but I’m seeing my friends like Chris Person and Luke Plunkett wrap on <em>Avowed</em>, and [the solution] is not fewer, bigger projects; it’s more adequately scaled projects with clear parameters. That’s what we need. It’s not limiting the flagship game to once every five years or whatever. It’s having fewer flagship games and not resting all your economic and cultural expectations on one thing. That’s never gonna work. Why not be pleasantly surprised by a medium-sized game doing really well?</p><p>Microsoft has repeatedly said, despite what people on the internet will try to tell you, that they are happy with <em>Avowed</em>’s sales, and the developers seem to be very happy with how the game is being received by players and not weird people on YouTube. I can’t help but think that Microsoft – which is primarily a company that makes software and software products – does understand how to scale these things. Why wouldn’t you look to other industry leaders in this, instead of looking to entertainment industry models that don’t make sense with how video games are created?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There’s that meme of “I want smaller games with worse graphics blah blah blah.” It’s not even that. I want mid-sized games that are scaled to a relatively sane degree – that are not trying to be everything for everyone because a) nothing can be everything for everyone, and b) the games that are functionally that already exist. You’re never going to supplant <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Valorant </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these big companies believe that if you just pump enough money into something, you can overcome all of life’s problems. And time and time again, they fail, and the money’s no longer imaginary; there are real, tangible repercussions in terms of how it affects the people who worked on those projects. They don’t have jobs anymore. The only people who were unaffected, as ever, were the fucking executives, and they get to keep making these stupid mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita and Riley:</strong> [Pregnant pause] Yep!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think that in the case of something like Monolith, it’s especially galling because their track record is crazy. They were such a good studio in this way that was somewhat underappreciated. I think their games, reputationally, grew after they came out and had their moment. Back when <em>F.E.A.R. </em>came out, people were like “Yeah, it’s kind of this interesting shooter. It’s got slow-mo. It draws on certain types of horror cinema.” Now, decades later, people are still like “Oh man, does the AI in this FPS compare to <em>F.E.A.R.</em>’s?” That’s become its calling card. It’s this legendary game in people’s minds in a way that it wasn’t when it came out.&nbsp;</p><p>Same with the Nemesis System. Everyone’s like “Where did that go? What happened to that? That was one of the coolest things to come out of a couple console generations ago. Why aren’t more people doing that?” Monolith came up with all this stuff that should have been imitated and wasn’t. Losing a studio that has that kind of ingenuity is one of those tragedies that can’t be fully measured. You can’t understand the knock-on effects because things that could’ve happened now just won’t. There’s only an absence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc"><h3>Islands And Trains Are Two Of My Favorite Things</h3></a><p>'Craft tiny railway dioramas in a stress-free island sandbox' oh hell yes</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> has been getting increasingly, delightfully weird over the last couple of years, leading up to last year's time-travelling, NPC-romancing blast back to 1999. And things are about to get even wilder when developer Digital Extremes invites players to start kicking boy band butt in its new Techrot Encore update, arriving on 19th March.
</p>
<p>
Techrot Encore sees Digital Extremes building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">last year's 1999 update</a> by introducing a range of new gameplay systems. That begins with the introduction of the Technocyte Coda - a corruption of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88">Warframe's in-game 90s boy band On-lyne</a>, whose members (Harddrive, Zeke, Drillbit, Packet, and DJ RoM) will randomly appear in levels until players defeat them.
</p>
<p>
It's an adversary system - originally due to launch last year until it ballooned into something more expansive - that works similarly to Warframe's Kuva Lich and Sisters of Parvos. As such, players - who'll need to have completed The Hex quest first - can't have a Lich or Sister tied to them if they want to experience the Technocyte Coda. Oh and be warned that you'll gain a steadily growing pimple until you manage to defeat your bothersome boy band foe.

<p>
On top of that, Techrot Encore adds four new Protoframes to 1999's Höllvania Mall, which has been expanded to provide access to the grungy The Round Table pub. Here, players can meet Velimir (the Protoframe of Frost) and his ex-wife Minerva (Saryn), as well as brilliant young engineer Kaya Velasco, the Protoframe of Nova. And lastly, there's the David Bowie-inspired Flare - the only surviving member of a band called Temple, and the Protoframe for the game's musically inclined, talking-guitar-wielding 60th Warframe, Temple.
</p>
<p>
All these characters have a presence in the mall, meaning you can talk to them in the world, or delve deeper into their backstories through conversations using 1999's AOL-inspired KIN system. You won't, however, be able to romance any of the new NPCs. Not even the guitar.
</p>
<p>
Away from the story stuff, Kaya's your port of call for accessing Techrot Encore's tough new Temporal Archimedea missions. These can be played for various rewards, and feature a stackable sticker-inspired boost system players can explore to gain advantages while out in the field. That's alongside Flare's new Stage Defence missions, which see players venturing out to Solstice Square. Here, their job is to protect Temple from incoming foes across three waves (all Defence missions have been reduced to three waves in the new update) as he rocks out on stage in mourning for his bandmates.
</p>
<p>
Rewards for successfully completing a Stage Defence mission include Techrot Heartstrings. These can be given to Flare at The Round Table to get Temple's blueprints if you're not lucky enough to receive them as a mission reward. Temple, incidentally, is a heat-based Warframe with a distinct musical twist, given that he - and his sentient guitar Lizzy - gain an attack boost if players manage to cast his abilities on the beat.
</p>
<p>
Pyrotechnics, for instance, causes Temple to rock out on guitar and unleash pillars of fire, which can be doubled if deployed on the beat. Overdrive, meanwhile, is a crit debuff that spawns a circle of subwoofers to stun enemies, and can extend the duration of Ripper's Wail if on-beat. Speaking of which, this one's a buff ability that heals player and makes them invulnerable for a time, all while giving fire damage to allies. Landing on the beat makes healing twice as effective. And finally there's Exalted Solo, which turns Lizzy into a flame thrower (because why not!) that can be augmented with additional electricity attacks.
</p>
<p>
And there's plenty more! Techrot Encore also features a new Rainbow Road-inspired bike-racing arcade game known as Ollie's Crash Course, and brings new Ollie-themed cosmetics, including an Ollie floof. That's alongside a huge range of adjustments and quality of life improvents, including Warframe augments for Gyre, Qorvex, Koumei, and Wisp, plus a Pseudo Exalted Rework for Kora, Atlas, Gard, and Ash. Players can also expect a shortened Star Chart path - making it easier to access the Second Dream quest and the wild new content Warframe's added in the last few years. There's also easier Archwing crafting, plus changes to make The Duviri Paradox and the The Hex Quest more replayable. And most exciting of all, there'll finally be a way to replay Fortuna's iconic We All Lift Together cinematic.
</p>
<p>
All this will be available when Warframe's expansive (and free) Techrot Encore update launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 19th March.

			<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> released on the official Ubisoft website, those interested in Assassin's Creed Shadows would be able to read about what is coming in the game. This post specifically focuses on the progression loop of the game, as well as the mastery trees and abilities that are available for players to use. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on March 20, with pre-orders currently being available, which includes free access to the upcoming expansion called <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">Claws of Awaji</a>.</p>
<p>"Having two separate characters with unique archetypes in our feudal Japan world pushed us to rethink how we wanted to approach player progression," says Julien, Associate Game Director. "Our goal was to stay as close as possible to the philosophy of mastery and martial art."</p>
<p>Both Naoe and Yaskue will have multiple Mastery trees that they can invest in, with the trees being unique to both characters. The Mastery trees featured in the game are tied to the unique weapons that they can utilize, as well as the archetypes set for each character.</p>
<p>The weapon trees will allow you to improve your pre-existing skills, as well as learn new combos and increase weapon efficacy, which can help you progress through the game as combat gets harder. When it comes to the archetype trees in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are multiple abilities you can unlock that will be beneficial for Naoe or Yasuke. For example, Yasuke can put points into samurai training, where he can then learn how to switch weapons mid-combo.</p>
<p>To be able to earn Mastery points to utilize the Mastery trees, you will need to level up your character, which can be done by undertaking quests and activities throughout feudal Japan. There will also be unique enemies that you can take down throughout the world, which will also provide you with Mastery points.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes on to explain Knowledge utility, as well as the equipment and stats that you will be dealing with in the game. There will also be a multitude of gear sets that you can collect in Assassin's Creed Shadows for both Naoe and Yasuke. The gear and weapons can be looted from chests or can be found on defeated enemies. It's also stated that the loot is largely randomized to provide players with a sense of unique discovery throughout the game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has released multiple of these blog posts now to provide information for those who may be on the fence about Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as those who are eagerly awaiting the game. Thus far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">controversial games</a> in the franchise, with a lot of uproar across the community.</p>
