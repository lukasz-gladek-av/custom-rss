            <p>
Cast your mind back a year or so ago, and you might remember <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> being in a bit of a funny old place. On the one hand, it was a huge critical and commercial success; on the other, it was being review bombed into oblivion thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-official-review-bomb-cape-seemingly-gets-an-airing-as-psn-drama-subsides">Sony's mandatory PSN nonsense</a>. Eventually, all that hoo-ha died down, but not before developer Arrowhead suggested it might commemorate the whole affair with a review-bomb-inspired cape. Well, praise Democracy, because that day - and that cape - is finally here.
</p>
<p>
Talk of a review-bomb-inspired Helldivers 2 cape first surfaced as fans were celebrating Sony's U-turn on the mandatory PSN requirements it had attempted to foist on PC players post-launch - a reversal that came after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">200,000 negative Steam reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">mass refunds</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">absolute mess</a> of a situation in territories where PSN was unavailable. Amid the cheers and back pats, former Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt (now the studio's chief creative officer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605">shared a community created cape design</a> on social media, featuring four red vertical lines mirroring those of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Helldivers 2's Steam review sentiment graph</a> during its review bombing.
</p>
<p>
Almost immediately, delighted fans called for its official inclusion in the game, and Pilestedt responded by saying, "The team is talking about a good name for it right now." At the time, it wasn't entirely clear if he was being serious, but last May he <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">teased an official cape design</a> - or at least a tiny cropped portion of one - that suggested the review bomb cape was legit. And now, a little over a year later, it's officially arrived as a commemorative keepsake.
</p>
<p>
Dubbed the Pillars of Freedom cape, it's being released "in honour of [players'] unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy," according to an <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728">official post on social media</a>. "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armouries as soon as the rollout is complete," Arrowhead adds. "This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of ups and downs for Helldivers 2, with last August bringing a particularly difficult bump in the road for Arrowhead following significant community criticism regarding the live-service shooter's direction. The studio quickly moved to address the situation, though, embarking on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-reveals-60-day-plan-of-action-following-recent-patch-outcry">60-day plan of action</a>, which helped get things back on track. And that unity has proven vital in the ongoing fight for Democracy, considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have recently faced perhaps their biggest threat yet as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">Illuminate invaded Super Earth itself</a>.

			<p>Free-to-play first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/">Delta Force</a> from developer Team Jade will arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles on <strong>August 19, 2025</strong>, the studio announced.</p>
<p>The news comes alongside the reveal of what Team Jade is calling the game's "<em>largest update yet,</em>" which will be available for players on PC and mobile platforms in a little less than two weeks' time, on&nbsp;<strong>July 9, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the new content coming on July 9, the Season Break update will bring new maps for Operations and Warfare, a new operator, swimming, improvements to Victory Unite, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="SEASON BREAK PREVIEW STREAM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlXOM1OyUHc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Operations map is called Tide Prison, a high-tech island prison that players have to infiltrate under the guise of being a new batch of prisoners, meaning you'll have to collect your gear after you're already inside. The new Warfare map is called Cyclone, a tropical island that's hiding an ICBM missile site.</p>
<p>Cyclone will feature infantry and vehicle combat, and adds a dynamic weather system to the gameplay to create even more intense chaos.</p>
<p>The new operator players can select is Tempest, who players can unlock for free along with the battle pass. Tempest is a movement-focused operator with an exoskeletal device that gives them greater mobility and is ideal for close-ranged encounters where she can easily close the gap between her and her unsuspecting foes.</p>
<p>Players looking to dive into Delta Force on consoles will be able to take advantage of all the content in the game up to its release this August, and will be able to play the Black Hawk Down single-player campaign as part of free DLC. If you're incredibly keen to play Delta Force on your PS5 or Xbox Series device, than you can wishlist the game starting tomorrow, June 28, so you'll be sent a reminder by your platform of choice that it's ready for you to hop into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair drops are coming. Wizards of the Coast has collaborated with Sega to bring their iconic, wisecracking, high-speed platforming mascot (and his friends) to the world's most popular card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair Superdrop Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-the-sonic-superdrop" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the <em>Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair will comprise of three drops. This Superdrop is similar to another Magic crossover with a beloved mascot: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em></a>. One drop will feature original card designs, one features classic cards with a Sonic twist, and the third drop reimagines other cards in the Sonic setting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair-friends-and-foes-artwork.jpg?itok=pbA6h9XN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair-friends-and-foes-artwork.jpg?itok=nuHDwu-5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these drops, called <em>Friends &amp; Foes</em>, features the speedster's supporting cast. This includes staples like Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, and Amy. Fittingly, almost all characters have Haste. The drop even contains a 7-cost Enchantment called <em>Super State</em>. Given you usually need seven Chaos Emeralds to achieve a super form, the designers knew what they were doing.</p>

Much like the characters, these bits of gear are ubiquitous and almost as recognizable as the characters. Shadow's air shoes, Amy's Piko Piko Hammer, Eggman's Egg Pawn robots, or the Tornado Biplane. The cards featured in this set are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>The Reaver Cleaver</em> as "<em>Knuckles' Gloves</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Swiftfoot Boots</em> as "<em>Air Shoes</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Myr Battlesphere</em> as "<em>Egg Hammer</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Hammer of Nazahan</em> as "<em>Piko Piko Hammer</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Lightning Greaves</em> as "<em>Power Sneakers</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Weatherlight</em> as "<em>Tornado, Sonic's Biplane</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Myr Token</em> as "<em>Egg Pawn</em>" token</li>

The seven cards in this drop feature Sonic artwork courtesy of&nbsp;Tracy Yardley, Mike Burns, Evan Stanley, Nathalie Fourdraine, and John Thacker. This includes a Treasure Token eating the series' iconic golden rings, and Fabricate showcasing Tails tinkering away in his workshop. The cards in this drop are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Generous Gift</em></li>
	<li><em>Open The Armory</em></li>
	<li><em>Fabricate</em></li>
	<li><em>Deadly Dispute</em></li>
	<li><em>Unexpected Windfall</em></li>
	<li><em>Sol Ring</em></li>
	<li><em>Treasure Token</em></li>
</ul><p>Each drop in the <em>Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair will cost $29.99 (non-foil) and $39.99 (foil), respectively. If you place an order above $100, shipping will be included.</p>

Capcom writes that it has “adjusted the amount of VRAM used with texture streaming, resulting in reduced overall VRAM usage.” That could help with resolution, framerate, and the amount of pop-in players encounter on PC while exploring the map. Other notable changes include new support for  DLSS4 and FSR4 for graphics upscaling, including multi-frame generation for new Nvidia cards. I’m not confident this is nearly sufficient to address what players are complaining about on PC, so we’ll have to wait and see just how much this improves game performance for the average <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fan. </p><p>While Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992">promised to address the poor state</a></span> of the PC version, major improvements have been slow to arrive. The game has been flooded with negative Steam reviews over the last month, with many players arguing that performance has actually gotten worse with each new update. “As of 5/28/2025, after 250+ hours of gameplay, the game will no longer boot up,” wrote one player on Steam. “<em>Monster Hunter Wilds?</em> Total disaster, folks. Frame rate drops harder than Biden on Air Force One,” wrote another. “Gameplay is fantastic, but the system requirements are a total lie fallacy, as is the benchmark,” wrote a third. “It’s not so bad at first until you get farther in, where weather effects really start taking effect and the framerate just tanks.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As players beat the drums of <em>Monster Hunter</em> discontent throughout June</a></span>, another major issue has been a sense that <em>Wilds</em>’<em>&nbsp;</em>endgame is too shallow, and there’s been renewed criticism arguing that playing it can feel like being on autopilot. Director Yuya Tokuda promised this week that Seregios will be the game’s most unpredictable boss fight yet, suggesting a fresh challenge for fans who feel like they’ve been sleepwalking the last few months. As teased by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese<em> Wilds </em>social media account</a></span>, September’s Title 3 update will include a new difficulty tier for quests, additional rewards, and RNG talismans, one of the core building blocks of every hunter build. </p><p>It’s good news that’s left some players scratching their heads. “So the actual endgame is going to come out 6 months after release date, huh?” one wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the<em> Monster Hunter</em> subreddit</a></span>. <em>Wilds</em> is currently averaging 17,000 concurrent players on Steam, scarcely 1 percent of its debut back in late February. Perhaps even more notably, it’s less than what <em>Monster Hunter: World </em>averages, and that came out back in 2018. That entry’s first big expansion didn’t arrive until 18 months after its release. Some fans are worried it could take <em>Wilds</em> that long to become the game they hoped it would be. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If entertainment writing hadn’t panned out, I like to think I’d have pursued a career in music. My only real experience, however, was a brief (and admittedly shaky) run as the second-chair violinist in my grade school orchestra—an honor that was mine by virtue of my more talented musical predecessor transferring schools. My musical acumen was only thanks to my color-coordinating sheet music so I knew where to put my fingers.</p><p>Music has always fascinated me, making it my fourth favorite passion after gaming, anime, and wrestling. I particularly enjoy unexpected collaborations like Imagine Dragons getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Duje_sZko8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carried by Japanese songstress Ado on their “Take Me To The Beach” remix</a>, Prince’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRCooFKk3c&amp;pp=ygUvcHJpbmNlIGd1aXRhciBzb2xvIHdoaWxlIG15IGd1aXRhciBnZW50bHkgd2VlcHM%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showstopping guitar solo cover of the Beatles’ “While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>,” and spontaneous live duets where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAOLJVsk9mA&amp;pp=ygUkbGlua2luIHBhcmsgY3Jhd2xpbmcgaW4gbXkgc2tpbiBkdWV0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell sang “Crawling In My Skin</a>,” breathing new life into an already timeless bop. Recently, I’ve become obsessed with a YouTube channel that motivates viewers to discover their inner musician by featuring rock legends who lead by example with improvisational flair.&nbsp;</p><p>While doom-scrolling my For You Page on TikTok, I stumbled upon highlight reels for a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrumeoOfficial/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drumeo</a>. Drumeo is an online drumming school aimed at turning curious beginners into confident musicians who wouldn’t blink if asked to tackle late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins’ deceptively tricky “Everlong” part. What captivated me about Drumeo wasn’t its drumming lessons, but segments where legendary performers listen to popular songs for the first time with the drums removed and improvise how they would accompany them. These segments are essentially musical fan fiction, testing each artist’s musical instinct and giving me, a music sicko, new covers to obsess over. In that spirit, I’m going to share three of my favorite of these segments in sequential order of how hard they fuck musically.&nbsp;</p><h2>John Stamos playing Papa Roach’s “Last Resort”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="John Stamos Hears Papa Roach For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZhJo3ieZJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Somehow, in all of Stamos’ 61 years of jamming out, including with The Beach Boys, he’s never listened to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort.” Watching him stop and start, inching his way into the chaos of the track, is strangely exhilarating. He feels out which of the many drums I won’t even pretend to know would best carry the weight of the beat, building the skeleton that’ll support the raucous emo rock anthem. After a thorough listen and a few curious jabs at the rhythm, his back-and-forth with the song turns almost jazz-like in its spontaneity and interpretive interjections. The groove he arrives at, after confirming it’s a heavy metal track, winds up breathing an even more briskly paced drum line that gives the song a whole new dimension that’s fascinating to listen to.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Police’s Stewart Copeland playing Limp Bizkit’s “Rollin’”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stewart Copeland Hears Limp Bizkit For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrbLyEKC524?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My second favorite in Drumeo’s For The First Time series is Stewart Copeland, who humbly and confidently tries to play Limp Bizkit’s “Rollin’.” After swigging his drumstick in his coffee (we listen and we don’t judge) and jokingly saying, “I don’t know shit about any songs,” Copeland absolutely nails the metal track, plunging headfirst into his version of its drumline. His take, surprisingly, sounds like a live performance of the song, enhanced with some flourishes and embellishments, showing Copeland's flair for adding a playful energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before watching this video, I’ll admit that I had never heard of Copeland. To me, The Police were just a homogeneous, monolithic musical entity without any distinguishable humans making up its parts. But after watching this, I’m obsessed with Uncle Stew Daddy’s energy and candor. I was especially tickled by him saying, “I like those guys [Limp Bizkit] in concept. I’m not that familiar with their music.” Like that’s the most polite and funny way to say “bless your heart” about a band while giving them kudos. And yes, I’ll be adding that phrase into my lexicon. Thank you very much, Mr. Copeland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith playing Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Chad Smith Hears Bring Me The Horizon For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Htmcj6HBN7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My absolute favorite video in this series is Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer Chad Smith being given the herculean task of improvising a drum line to Bring Me The Horizon’s banger “Can You Feel My Heart.” Words almost fail me to describe what it's like watching him, deep in his musical flow state like a man possessed, immediately delivering the most fitting drum accompaniment for the song. This performance straight up blows the original song out of the water. Smith’s version of “Can You Feel My Heart” damn near made me want to jump off of my couch and rip my shirt clean from its lapel with how masterfully he handles shaping its beat. What’s more, he even dared to suggest that his approach might not have been the right one for the song at all. Be so serious.</p><p>While all of the above might not be enough to convince me to enroll in Drumeo’s online academy (I’m more of a bass guy; problematic, I know), I understand why it serves as the channel’s leading example of what they offer to prospective musicians. I’m just happy to find covers I didn’t know I needed and learn more about the personalities behind some of the bands in my music rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Riot Games has announced that it will begin officially sanctioning sports-betting sponsorships for esports teams in its Tier 1 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> leagues. While the company states that it still won't allow advertisements in its official broadcasts, teams themselves will be able to take money from sports-betting companies for advertising through their own channels.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, President of Publishing and Esports John Needham writes that the move is designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing sports-betting industry and to make esports-related betting more regulated. Seemingly to address concerns and head off potential criticism, Needham explains that the company is authorizing sports-betting sponsorships under a "guardrails first" strategy.</p><p>These "guardrails," Needham states, are essentially the rules by which any sponsorship must be executed. First, sports-betting companies need to be vetted and approved by Riot itself, although the company has not shared the criteria on which this vetting is done. Second, to ensure that sports-betting companies are on a level playing field, Riot is mandating that official partners all use GRID, the officially sanctioned data platform for League of Legends and Valorant. Third, esports teams must launch and maintain internal integrity programs to protect against violations of league rules due to the influence of sports betting. Fourth and last, Riot will use some of the revenue from these sponsorships to support its Tier 2 (lower division) esports leagues.</p><p>One of the biggest sources of anxiety and frustration around the explosion of sports betting in the United States has been the increasingly high frequency of sports-betting advertising, and Riot addresses this concern by promising to not have ads from these companies in "Riot-owned broadcast and social channels." This also means that teams will not be allowed to have sports-betting ads on team member jerseys. The only place these ads will be able to run are on team-owned channels. As Needham explains, "It will be up to each team to craft how sports-betting-related content shows up on their channels within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS [terms of service], and local regulations."</p><p>The company's justification for authorizing sports-betting sponsorships appears to center on a desire to address underground, unofficial, or otherwise unauthorized betting networks and organizations. "Sports betting--and more specifically, esports betting--is a space that more fans choose to engage with every year," Needham writes. "According to Sportradar, the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024. But here's the problem: 70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed."</p><p>As such, the company hopes that it can bring more of this activity under the auspices of the company, where it hopes to exert some regulatory influence (and, one would suspect, be able to collect more of the revenue that flows through sports-betting apps).</p><p>Despite the blog post's efforts to emphasize protecting esports integrity, though, Needham and Riot have not addressed any of the social issues that have been caused by the growth of sports betting throughout the country. An NCAA-sponsored study, for example, found that increasing harassment of college athletes in the United States can be <a href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ncaa/wagering/NCAAThreatMatrixPilotStudyPublicReport.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">primarily attributed to anger and disappointment related to sports betting</a>. This dynamic may be even worse along gendered lines; some evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a64772215/womens-sports-harassment-stalking-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">betting-related harassment disproportionately targets women</a>. Riot has yet to state if it will take any particular precautions to mitigate potential harms caused by sports betting; most of its emphasis so far appears to be assuaging fears about match fixing or other threats to esports integrity.</p>

<p>To help me try and silence those voices and get a few extra hours of sleep, I was graciously given the chance to pepper Deltarune's creator, Toby Fox, with a few of the questions that have been knockin' about in my noggin. Did Toby answer my questions? Yes. Did he also take every opportunity to run in a different direction and troll me? Yes, and yes, but that's truly for you to decide. Did I love every part of his reply? <em>Absolutely</em>. Mild spoilers ahead by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): The game show element introduced in Chapter 3, hosted by Tenna, has his third round of the show abruptly cancelled. Did you ever have more fleshed out plans for that third round, or were you always planning to cancel it on the poor guy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> We made most of it, but cut it because it slowed down the pacing too much. To put it in words that fans will understand, "Your taking too long" + "the game's getting old."</p>

<p><strong>What drove you to make the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3 a seemingly impossible fight and how do you playtest something so difficult?</strong></p>
<p>You mean Elnina + Lanino? Yeah, there's actually a playtester that gave up at that point... Well, I didn't make it that hard on purpose. But, I did make it so that if you get a Game Over and you have no points and no healing items, you get 2 TV Dinners for free.</p>
<p>After using "ILoveTV" a couple times, it should be enough to beat the battle just by defending and healing, so keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>What sort of music brings you joy these days and what are a few musicians you find yourself listening to? Also, are you aware of the artist Porter Robinson? I feel like you two would make great pals and I'd selfishly love to see how you two could collaborate!</strong></p>
<p>I'm excited for the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_chiptune_band_anamanaguchi_shares_insight_into_its_latest_album_and_dream_smash_bros_fighters">anamanaguchi</a> album, "<a href="https://anamanaguchi.com/">Anyway</a>".</p>
<p>I heard <a href="https://porterrobinson.com/">Porter Robinson</a> before... that's right, the name of the music video was... "<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0">Shelter</a>" <em>(upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)</em></p>

<p><strong>How has it been developing for Switch 2 and have you had any thoughts of how you could take advantage of the unique hardware again down the road?</strong></p>
<p>It was kind of like the Nintendo Switch, but a much much bigger number, and strong. Down the road I'd like to take advantage of the unique hardware to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>I can't believe they misspelled "Bananaz" but I'll let it slide because they turned the rock into a girl. I wonder if she was originally intended to stay a rock, but then they realized that she didn't sing rock music, she sang girl music.</p>
<p><strong>How has it felt releasing your story in chunks/chapters like this, as opposed to a fully complete package and when are you personally hoping to have the final chapter of Deltarune release? Are we cursing you by even asking such a question?</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>I've never called them chunks. Maybe I should start calling them chunks? Like, here comes Chunk 5. I mean, that would be great if it was a game about cavemen, like Chuck Rock, or Bonk. That being said, I do feel like calling each episode a "Chapter" really undersells the fact that creating each one is like developing its own game. I've made the equivalent of like 2 and a half Undertales at this point. Continuously.</p>
<p>As for when it comes out, it should be out when it's done, which is as soon as it's finished, which, in my opinion, sooner would be better, but it takes a while. If it takes too long everybody is going to say " you're taking too long" and then I'll say "I'm old!" They'll have to revive me</p>

<p><em>Big thanks to Toby for taking the time away from his never ending development cycle to answer our questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Deltarune is now available on the eShop and currently includes Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can also try the first two chapters for free by downloading the demo. All future chapters will be added to the paid package as and when they release</em></p>

While players continue to pour over the details, they may find a few Easter eggs that were placed in the game by Kojima himself. According to Kojima, he only took that hands-on approach because his staff refused to do it for him.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/death-stranding-2s-kojima-related-easter-eggs-were-all-self-inserted-because-his-team-refused-to-humor-him/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kojima confirmed that he personally added those nods to his past. He went on to say that when his staff was asked to include his self-referential jokes, they would pretend they didn't hear him.</p><p>It's possible that Kojima was only joking about his staff's lack of enthusiasm for his ideas, but he did share the details about where one of his Easter eggs is hidden. He noted that it can be found when players visit a hot spring and look up at the sky before zooming in on the stars.</p><p>Later this fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-art-book-goes-behinds-the-scenes-on-death-stranding-2-on-the-beachs-development/1100-6532664/" data-ref-id="1100-6532664">The Art of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> will offer an in-depth look at the creation of Kojima's latest game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Buffing too close to the sun.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is filled with excellent loot for Nightfarers to wield, on your expedition to take down the Nightlords. But how excellent can it get? Well, one player who found a rare weapon and decided to find out has gone viral for building their blade up into the ultimate Nightlord-slaying machine — only to see it also then ultimately tumble back down to nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this centers on Japanese YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mintius" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mintius</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreign-player-pushes-attack-damage-to-very-limit-reaches-godhood-for-a-moment-before-glitching-out-and-becoming-completely-defenseless/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton Media</a>), who acquired the Marais Executioner Sword, a weapon that raises attack power upon defeating enemies — but usually only by a certain amount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Nightreign usually has time limits, thanks to its encroaching storm, this sword's power wouldn't normally have the chance to snowball <em>too </em>far out of control, despite being a strong weapon. But Mintius managed to get the right combination of enemy and encounter spawns to scale it as far as it can go, and then even further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Automaton's translation, Mintius hunted mobs in the Wormface encounter for "about an hour" with the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what would happen. Their attack power hit a damage cap at 9,999 after defeating 725 enemies, with the last damage value he saw as 63,375. After defeating the 727th enemy, though, Mintius was "suddenly unable to deal any damage at all," and got killed.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">「マレー家の執行剣」で1時間ほどミミズ顔の雑魚を狩り続けて検証<br>727体の敵を撃破して攻撃力は9999で余裕のカンスト<br>最後にステータスから確認したマレー家の執行剣の表示攻撃力は63375<br>725体目を撃破したところで、突如として全ての敵へ一切ダメージを与えられない状態になり死亡した <a href="https://t.co/q95neZfdu3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/q95neZfdu3</a></p>— 負けミン mintius (@amabamamabam1) <a href="https://twitter.com/amabamamabam1/status/1937574056943030323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The going theory is that Mintius hit an "overflow," and suddenly went from hitting the damage ceiling to scraping the damage floor. Much like the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nuclear-gandhi-meme-civilization/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet tall-tale about Gandhi in Civilization</a>, hitting the upper-limit may have caused Mintius to wrap back around to the lower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mintius is apparently going to continue testing the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what kind of limits and bounds exist on it, as well as the incredible damage potential behind it. They apparently want to try doing a plunging attack on a Flame Chariot, just to see what kind of damage numbers it can put up. It will probably get wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, maybe take this as a sign to not get <em>too </em>greedy in farming up that Marais Executioner Sword when you find it. Or at least, don't spend an hour doing so. It certainly seems like a good weapon, but it looks like there's some hubris to be found in trying to take it to its highest heights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-takes-a-damage-stacking-weapon-to-its-highest-heights-before-it-all-comes-crashing-down]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A quick one to end the day. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has done a fair-to-miraculous job of reviving enthusiasm for the despised QTE, players remain suspicious of minigame-style mechanics in combat systems - and when I say players I mean <em>you</em>, the people who fretted in the comments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcoms-pragmata-is-a-clean-and-pleasant-lunar-shooter-with-a-touch-of-god-of-war">my recent article on Pragmata</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom’s upcoming space-me-daddo-shooty-doo has a debuff mechanic whereby the android girl riding on your back hacks the robots you’re fighting – a process of moving a cursor around a grid of glyphs to deactivate shields and so forth.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It’s the kind of subtask that may seem annoying on paper. I didn’t find it intrusive during my Summer Game Fest hands-on, but why should you pay attention to me, the melonhead who almost got himself kicked out of the demo session by losing his temper when the PR told him he couldn’t take a picture of the controller diagram print-out? The very same dipstick who then insisted on passive-aggressively drawing the print-out in his notepad, spitefully frittering away five minutes of the session and probably getting himself disinvited from future events? The exact same consummate wellington who has now written all this down for public consumption, just in case those PRs had forgotten?</p>
<p>No, I think you’re better off trying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>’s hacking for yourself care of <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/gameplay/">this brief browser demo</a>. It’s a cursory but solid approximation of the combat system I sampled this month, though obviously it doesn't factor in all the strafing, reloading and such.</p>
<p>I feel pretty positive about Pragmata as a whole, though I doubt it'll set the world on fire. It's a cleanly-built and straightforward shoulder-shooter with just enough intricacy to make you feel clever, even when you're smouldering with outrage and wondering if you can get #Capcomgate trending on Bluesky.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-know-you-fear-minigames-in-your-combat-so-why-not-test-out-pragmatas-hacking-in-a-browser]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before we saw the official reveal of Resident Evil Requiem during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest</a> event, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">rumors that the next entry into the historically linear franchise would be an open-world game</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we know Resident Evil 9, officially called Resident Evil Requiem, is in fact not an open-world game, and closer to what players expect from the series, it's easy to dismiss those rumors as just that - rumors. Well, according to Capcom, those were not rumors and were indicative of how Requiem began its development journey.</p>
<p>In an extended version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shows-off-brief-look-at-first-and-third-person-gameplay-as-resident-evil-requiem-takes-players-back-to-raccoon-city/">Resident Evil Requiem Creator's Message video</a> that's only available through the <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/video.html">Resident Evil Portal on Capcom's website</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-reveals-resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-online-game-but-we-realised-fans-didnt-want-it/">VGC</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed the rumors were true, though Capcom pivoted from its open-world approach after concluding that this wasn't the direction players wanted the series to go in.</p>
<p>"<em>You might have heard some of the</em> <em>rumors</em>," Nakanishi began. "<em>Things like an online Resident Evil or an open-world Resident Evil, which we spent some time experimenting with. But in the end, although we had some interesting concepts, we realized that it wasn't what fans wanted to see or play. So we went back to the drawing board and created what led to Resident Evil Requiem.</em>"</p>
<p>Having the context that those rumors were true, and that Resident Evil 9 was almost an open-world, potentially online-focused game, makes the opening statement from producer Masachika Kawata make a lot of sense, as he begins his section of the Creator's Message video by clarifying that Resident Evil Requiem "<em>is an offline single-player game</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a time when it feels like many of the bigger publishers and developers are trying to push an online focus onto historically offline single-player games, it's nice to hear a story where the team realized early enough that things needed to go in a different direction.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder how different things could have been for other games that we know went through a similar process, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's leadership kept pushing for Dragon Age to be a live service title</a> and realized far too late in the development of what became Dragon Age: The Veilguard that they had been barking up the wrong tree. And we all know<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> how that went</a>.</p>
<p>At least in the case of Resident Evil Requiem, we can look forward to its release next year with plenty of excitement, as Capcom is on a hot-streak of excellent releases. Perhaps that has something to do with their leaders having more than just hollow space and dollar signs in the six inches between their ears.</p>

            <p>Riot Games are going to let their top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> esports teams receive sponsorship from gambling companies, in a bid to snaffle up some of the billion dollar unofficial sports betting scene that surrounds both games.</p>
<p>The publishers promise that they'll put appropriate "guardrails" in place to ensure that streams of tournaments aren't suddenly overrun by shady gambling ads, and to protect players and viewers from the psychological impacts of gambling. They even think it'll be beneficial to the community, in supposedly giving Riot more control of the existing esports gambling business. But the overriding rationale here is very much 'this is a big dirty pie and we'd rather like a slice'. </p>
<p>The change in policy will only apply to tier 1 League of Legends and Valorant teams in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that," Riot's head of publishing and esports John Needham <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">explains in a blog post</a>. "However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not. </p>
<p>"Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies," he continues. "Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham supports this with a few figures taken from a <a href="https://sportradar.com/">Sportsradar</a> analysis. Apparently, "the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024". However, "70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed". Riot feel it's "better to engage in allowing betting sponsorships - thoughtfully, carefully, and with the right protections - than to sit on the sidelines while risks to fans and integrity go unchecked." In other words, Riot are of the opinion that the best way to protect people from the gambling companies is to team up with them.</p>
<p>As for the "guardrails" against predatory or anti-competitive behaviour on the part of either the bookies or their player partners: sports betting companies hoping to sign a deal with one of Riot's partner teams will need to be vetted by Riot. Those companies will also need to make use of GRID, a third-party esports data-gathering platform, who partnered with Riot in 2023. As Needham comments, "using clean, official data is critical to weakening black markets and stopping shady operators from taking advantage of fans and pros". The teams themselves will need to set up an "Internal Integrity Program", to ensure they don't do anything dodgy, though Needham doesn't specify what such a program might consist of.</p>
<p>While the sports betting sponsorship will only be available to Tier 1 League Of Legends or Valorant esports teams, "a portion of Riot's revenues earned from the sports betting program" will be spent on prize pools, new tournaments and training for the Tier 2 bracket.</p>
<p>The last reassurance in the blog post is aimed at viewers: Riot-owned broadcast and social channels will remain "betting-free, which means no ads, no sponsored segments from betting partners, and no betting partner logos on team jerseys", though this doesn't appear to apply to co-streams. Teams will get to decide how sports betting shows up on their own channels "within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS, and local regulations".</p>
<p>As Connor Makar unfolds over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant">Eurogamer</a>, the context for these announcements is that the esports industry is in need of a cash injection, post-Covid-lockdowns and following the demise of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> League in particular. Riot and parent company Tencent are in the mood to boost their numbers, going by the language around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">recent layoffs</a>. Still, none of this is really in the interest of everyday players and viewers, especially the many children who watch esports tournaments and follow the top teams. Gambling is a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling">public health problem</a>, and now, League Of Legends and Valorant are part of it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-will-let-gambling-companies-sponsor-league-of-legends-and-valorant-esports-teams]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For a little while now, a group of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders have been working on adding a custom adventure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> that'll see you travel to Minthara's hometown via some locations you'll remember from previous Baldur’s Gate games. It's called Path to Menzoberranzan, and its devs have now gotten thir first build working, with demo-related news seemingly just around the corner.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/baldurs-gate-3-path-to-menzobarranzan-custom-campaign-mod-interview">interviewed Lotrich and Tomobamba</a>, the mod's project lead and lead writer, about their creation earlier this year, around the time they'd set their sights on releasing a demo in mid 2025, with a full release to follow at some point down the line depending on how that went. Since then they've been hard at work building and fleshing out the likes of custom locations, bosses, and a whole cast of new companions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1293115909166075918/1387740347387482203">latest monthly progress update</a> on Path to Menzoberranzan's Discord server, Lotrich lead off by announcing that the team had gotten their "first working build" up and running. "We’ve made big strides on the starting location," he wrote, "The build includes combat, dialogues, companions, and a slice of the story to dive into. We're not sharing it to public access, yet, but it will provide a solid foundation for our first demo in the future."</p>
<p>With the FAQ of the server still citing a January post about that mid 2025 demo release goal, and the calendar having now shuffled around to June, I reached out to Lotrich to see if he had any updates to offer demo-wise. The modder was keen to keep his cards close to his chest, but did tease that the team's keeping some demo-related news "under wraps just a little longer".</p>

<p>Moving back to the updates the PTM crew did share, Lotrich noted that they're "deep into research on implementing custom music". They've also been working on both new armour and 3D models for the mod's companions, who'll be a fresh cast of fully voice-acted faces, rather than the existing gang of Astarion, Shart, and the rest.</p>
<p>The modder added that "reorganizing the teams to streamline our workflow and make collaboration smoother for everyone" has been a focus, while PTM's PR team have been prepping "new types of videos to better showcase our progress, visuals, and behind-the-scenes efforts".</p>
<p>Up to this point, the looks that we've gotten at Path to Menzobarranzan's progress have come through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1k3pspn/custom_campaign_path_to_menzoberranzan_city/">screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lotrichexe4860">YouTube videos</a> Lotrich has been sharing every so often. There've been some interesting snippets of characters wandering around Athkatla, with the modders having told me in that chat earlier this year that their aim with the demo would be to deliver an explorable Waukeen's Promenade and Irenicus' Dungeon.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what the mod looks like once a playable version's out. The base version of Baldur's Gate 3's an incredibly tough act to follow for anyone, but it's been cool to see these modders and others trying complex stuff with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-will-add-official-mod-tools-this-september-making-it-even-easier-to-play-dungeon-master">modding tools Larian released last year</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963"> Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s toughest boss fight, the Darkdrift Knight, is now in-game for a limited time only as his <strong>Everdark Sovereign</strong> version. Fulghor is one of the toughest Nightlords to beat thanks to his hard-hitting attacks combined with relentless speed. If you're trying to get all of the Remembrances, then you'll already have attempted to beat Fulghor on more than one occasion. To unlock and fight his Everdark Sovereign version, you'll need to have bested him at least once. Beyond that, here's the best way to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, including his weaknesses and our recommended builds.</p><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_recommended_setup">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight recommended setup</h2><p>The Darkdrift Knight, and in turn his Everdark Sovereign version, is weak to Lightning damage, but has resistance against Holy damage, as this is the type of damage he deals. You'll want to equip lightning-based relics such as the Dark Knight of Baron, which is acquired by beating the Sovereign Gaping Jaw, last week's Sovereign boss. If you didn't get that relic, choose any that boost Lightning attack power, strength, or dexterity stats.</p><p>On your way to the Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, make sure to interact with the Scale-Bearing Merchant if you come across him. He gives the option to grant resistance to status ailments, enhanced armaments, an additional sacred flask, runes, or improved physique. We chose to take the enhanced armament to increase the chances of getting anything Lightning-based. The best weapon to take to face him is the <strong>Bolt of Granssax</strong>. If you don't come across it, try to find any Lightning weapon. The <strong>Sword of Milos</strong> is also valuable, since it decreases the physical damage output of all bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091"></a><figcaption>Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight">How to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight</h2><p>After fighting this boss for several hours, it's safe to say he's not easy to take down. He's certainly harder than Gaping Jaw, but it does depend on your playstyle. As standard, he starts at phase two of his regular boss fight, and will already have his darkened arm that he uses for long-range attacks. He also uses it to slam down and create an area-of-effect (AoE) attack. Dodging this enables you to get some close-range hits in, as he will pause for around three seconds before continuing his assault.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092"></a><figcaption>Do not stand in the Darkdrift Knight's golden glow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>When Fulghor is charging an attack, you can stagger him by using heavy attacks. This is crucial to giving you and your teammates a window of opportunity to get some damage in. He will occasionally stampede through the arena using his lance. The golden light that he emits while doing this stampede will explode, so ensure you're not inside it when that happens.</p><p>Breaking the boss is easier with a Colossal weapon, so it's definitely recommended to hit him with heavy attacks as often as possible to enable you and your teammates to get damage in during those phases. This is most efficiently done as either the Raider or Wylder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">Nightreign classes</a>. Ironeye can use marking, which builds more Poise damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095"></a><figcaption>When Fulghor points to the sky, run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>During his next phase, Fulghor will spawn clouds that rain down arrows, which track you down. This is accompanied by a twinblade attack during which he will leap into the air and spin down to the ground with a slam. He also attacks with a regular bow with tracking arrows. The only way to avoid this is to run away--and fast. He will spin attack three times before concluding with the AoE slam.</p><p>If you see a wind effect on his blade, prepare for a wind attack. He will become faster and use a nuke attack. If he starts running and leaps high into the air, he's preparing to launch an explosive arrow with a massive AoE attack, which tracks. You'll either have to perfect dodge, perfect parry, or sprint away to give yourself more time to dodge it from a distance.</p><p>The most important strategy to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight is to remember to use your heavy attack. When he starts to aim, this is your crucial window to land heavy hits and break him. Then, your entire party can begin to hit him with as much damage as possible.</p><p>Repeat this process as many times as possible, remembering to prepare to perfect dodge three times when he begins his charge attacks. Though it is tricky timing, it is possible to perfect dodge those consecutive attacks. Eventually, he will be felled, and you can reap the rewards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099"></a><figcaption>You can purchase Fulghor's Enhanced Relic from the Collector Signboard after the fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_drops_and_rewards">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight drops and rewards</h2><p>Upon defeat, the Sovereign Fulghor will drop <strong>25 Sovereign Sigils for the first defeat, and 10 for each subsequent defeat</strong>.

<p>The official PR release has got all the deets you need, fellow dino-hunters!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nightdive Studios’ remastered Turok trilogy is renowned for modernizing the iconic games and bringing an epic saga to current-generation platforms. When it was first released in 1997, Turok introduced gamers to a world teeming with cunning enemies, traps, puzzles, and deadly weapons, all within a vast 3D environment ready to explore. All three of these classic games feature upgraded gameplay, high-resolution textures, enhanced lighting and rendering, and support for console gamepads with platform-specific features to sink your teeth into!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok</strong><br>
A world where time has no meaning and evil knows no bounds. Torn from a world long gone, the time-traveling warrior Turok has found himself thrust into an unknown land torn by conflict. An evil overlord known as 'The Campaigner' seeks to shred the fabric of time and rule the universe using an ancient artifact known as 'The Chronoscepter'. The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans to use to magnify and contain the power of the Chronoscepter to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner's evil plot...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</strong><br>
Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately, the blast awakens an even deadlier force — the Primagen. Once again, Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. The sequel to the hit game Turok features a host of enemies, weapons, missions, locations, and a new multiplayer mode.<br></em><em><strong><em><br>
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em></strong></em><em><br>
In the third game in the classic trilogy, players choose between dual protagonists Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> protagonist Joshua Fireseed. Together, they must defeat the titular antagonist Oblivion and its followers, the Flesh Eaters, after the supposed demise of their brother at its hands.</em></p>
