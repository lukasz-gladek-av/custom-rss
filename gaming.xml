		<p>Sony has announced the founding of teamLFG, a new studio within PlayStation Studios that’s formed around an incubation project and team that was formerly a part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bungie">Bungie</a>.</p>
<p>While the team is formed around that core of ex-Bungie developers, PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst explains that it “has also rallied developers from across the industry”.</p>


<p>Furthermore, teamLFG explains a little of what their game will be. Their first title will take inspiration from “fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.”</p>
<p>Here’s teamLFG’s announcement letter:</p>
<p>“Hello, world. It’s a delight to meet you, and we’re very grateful to be joining PlayStation Studios.</p>

<p>Our studio is headquartered in Bellevue, WA, with team members working both on-site and remotely throughout the U.S. and Canada. We are a team composed not just of industry veterans who have shipped titles like Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, Fortnite, Roblox, and Rec Room, but also industry newcomers with fresh creative perspectives and skills. We are passionate about exceptional action-based gameplay, moment-to-moment game feel, and richly social virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The “LFG” in “teamLFG” stands for “Looking For Group.” We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging. We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognize familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team – dat’s da good stuff.</p>
<p>We will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours. We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests. It’s critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come.</p>
<p>Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe. We can’t wait to reveal more.</p>
<p>‘Til then, we’ll do our best! Thanks for reading.”</p>
<p>– teamLFG</p>
<p>This new studio branched off from Bungie last August, amidst turmoil at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer. With Destiny 2 underperforming and a good long time still to go before the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> – now set for release in a few months from now – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons enacted a round of layoffs</a> that cut hundreds of jobs and moved even more across to the rest of PlayStation Studios. One Destiny 2 spin-off, codenamed Payback, was cancelled at that time, while a team of around 40 were to form a new studio and continue working on an “incubation project”. That team has now become teamLFG.</p>

			<p>At EVE Fanfest 2025, CCP Games unveiled plenty of news for its popular sci-fi franchise. From the latest EVE Online expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-legion-expansion-revealed-out-on-may-27-eve-vanguard-to-get-public-test-on-september-16-ahead-of-summer-2026-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legion</a>, to the launch window of the MMOFPS <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-vanguard-will-bring-the-mmorpgs-legendary-betrayals-to-a-shooter-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a> and even the survival-like Frontier, fans were treated to lots of announcements and info dumps.</p>
<p>We were on the show floor, having been invited by CCP, and had the chance to interview CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson about all these games to understand what the developer has planned for them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legion | Expansion Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1AbLH_uGLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>It's been more than five years since I spoke with CCP, and that was back at G-Star 2019 in Busan, shortly after Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired the company</a>. Can you talk about that partnership and how the acquisition has been going for you?</strong></p>
<p>It's been going great. We've largely just been doing our own thing. They're doing Black Desert and Crimson Desert and we're doing EVE. They are very nice people. There's a lot to learn from Koreans, who are extremely hardworking. You don't have an appreciation for what it is to be hardworking until you work with Koreans. I think we've learned a lot from each other. We've both been doing MMOs very differently, even if Black Desert and EVE Online are probably so far apart they're starting to be similar on some level. Both are very complicated.</p>
<p><strong>After March's GPU-driven Carbon update, capsuleers reported performance being cut by as much as 50% across Intel and Apple Silicon devices. What steps is CCP Games taking to help assure players that performance will improve alongside the graphic overhauls?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think we're largely dealing with a specific use case involving running multiple clients on the same machine, which is something we're researching. Generally, we're seeing a performance increase across more normal use cases. I think we're making good progress in tracking this down.</p>
<p>For sure, we will update our processes to better account for this multi-boxing use case, which is even sometimes called giga-boxing when you go with about 30 clients running on the same machine. It is something we don't really test properly for, and we should both trace down this and update our processes for that.</p>
<p><strong>Have there ever been any concerns about leaving behind players who haven't upgraded their systems in a number of years?</strong></p>
<p>EVE will turn 22 next week. I think there are computers from 2003 that don't run EVE anymore, which is good. At some point, you have to do that because otherwise it limits how much you can push into the future.</p>
<p><strong>Among corporations, there was The Initiative reset towards the beginning of the year. EVE Online hasn't seen any major conflicts in 2025 beyond a few minor skirmishes here and there. How long do you expect this tentative peace to last before another large scale battle breaks out?</strong></p>
<p>It's very hard for me to comment on EVE politics. You need an EVE political scientist to have any informed views on this, but I would say that at the start of the year, there was quite a lot going on, and generally, that does need some time to settle. Sometimes, wars in EVE Online are a little bit triggered around updates, and obviously, we are planning a major update now, which we're announcing here.</p>
<p>Often, when we do updates like that, it triggers something in the ecosystem. It doesn't always happen, but often it does. I wouldn't be surprised if there's going to be a perking up on the war front over the Summer, but I base that only on decades of observing the meta trends. If you were to base it on something that's actually going on in politics right now, I would talk to Peter Farrell in our community team. He has the finger on the politics.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With Frontier, we have a unique opportunity to experiment with some violent ideas which are hard to experiment with in EVE, which is a deadly serious business. It's a little less serious right now in Frontier because it's a new game and it's not that serious. It's an Alpha, and we're doing a lot of modifications, so we have a unique opportunity to push pretty aggressively on some things we have been hesitant to do on Eve, and messing with the tick rate is one. Based on how that plays out, for the benefit of doing it and the increased overhead of doing it, then absolutely, once we've proven these things out, we will look into what of this makes sense to bring back to EVE.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a> has been one of your big showcases lately. Is CCP Games hoping that Frontier could replace online over time, or are there plans to have both titles coexist?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely to coexist. I think we have several examples where things can very happily coexist. I remember many people being concerned when the iPad came out that the MacBook would disappear. I think Apple sold the most MacBooks when the iPad came out.</p>
<p>Generally, it has been a good addition to the ecosystem. I think we've seen things like in World of Warcraft, with modern and Classic, RuneScape Old School, RuneScape, and now <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have released a new survival game</a>. Lineage one and two are also great examples. We have several examples where many ways to experience an IP have absolutely coexisted and added to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe both titles are aimed at similar players, or do you think there are enough people in the world to populate both?</strong></p>
<p>We have a group of players who played EVE at some point but are no longer playing, and that group is about 20 million people. You basically have 20 million people who are not returning to EVE, and often, when we survey those 20 million people, they are looking for something new, fresh, and enigmatic to get that experience again.</p>
<p>We are largely calling back on the people who played EVE Online at some point and are currently not playing it. We're absolutely not looking for people to switch. People playing EVE Online today should absolutely continue playing;&nbsp;there's a lot of amazing stuff coming there.</p>
<p>But this group of 20 million people who were interested in the franchise at some point, we're calling those back. I think we can see some examples from when WoW Classic came out, where it was like a big reactivation campaign for the game. We were quite inspired by that.</p>
<p>And then we have this lingering impression around EVE Online that, because it's been going on for over 20 years, it's somehow too late to join. Even if it isn't the case, people have this kind of impression, so launching something where everyone is starting from an even base is a useful thing for us to do to see how that plays out with regards to that impression.</p>
<p><strong>For EVE Frontier, you promise a tick rate four times that of what EVE Online currently features. Could this be implemented back into EVE Online, or would that be unfeasible,&nbsp;given how time dilation plays a major part in battles?</strong></p>
<p>With Frontier, we have a unique opportunity to experiment with some violent ideas that are hard to experiment with in EVE, which is a deadly serious business. It's a little less serious right now in Frontier because it's a new game and it's not that serious. It's an Alpha, and we're doing a lot of modifications, so we have a unique opportunity to push pretty aggressively on some things we have been hesitant to do on Eve, and messing with the tick rate is one.</p>
<p>Based on how that plays out, for the benefit of doing it and the increased overhead of doing it, then absolutely, once we've proven these things out, we will look into what of this makes sense to bring back to EVE. One of the key elements, and we've actually been talking about it here at Fanfest, is that we upgraded Frontier to Python 3. EvVE currently runs on Python 2.7, a 15-year-old version of Python. It was about 1 million lines of C++ code and 4 million lines of Python code, and it took 2 years.</p>
<p>It took 4 weeks to get stable, but now we have achieved that in Frontier. We can now look at streaming that back into EVE, which is another big project. Still, we're doing that project now because we at least know that it can be done, even if there's a huge amount of additional work to bring it back.</p>
<p>I would never describe it as EVE 2. I would rather describe it as EVE 1 than EVE 2. It is weirdly more like EVE 1, and EVE today is more like 2. That's why it's not classic. It would not scratch the same itch as the original. When it came out, because it was so unprecedented, weird, and enigmatic, nobody knew, not even us, where it would go.</p>
<p>I can assure you, everyone who plays Frontier, and there are tens of thousands of people that have done that, they say 'what the actual fuck is going on here?'</p>
<p><strong>Looking at this from the view of an American, this is very much American frontierism, the manifest destiny. It's essentially a brand new frontier that you are going to stake your place in.</strong></p>
<p>It's very much like that. EVE had some of that feeling, but the premise wasn't quite there. It was a bit of a metropolis kind of feeling; now, it's very much a survival kind of feeling. Everything is ruined. It's post-apocalyptic. You need to rebuild a broken world, so we lean heavily on that.</p>

I can assure you, everyone who plays Frontier, and there are tens of thousands of people that have done that, they say 'what the actual fuck is going on here?''</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>It's going to be a learning experience for anyone, whether they're a veteran EVE player or coming in brand new and learning how to play by the new rules in Frontier.</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. And also for us. I think we're surprised at least once a year by stuff that the EVE online community does. The frequency and degree of surprise we witness from the Frontier community is just a lot. There's a certain amount of incredulity on our part when we see what the players get up to, but they also have much more agency to get up to stuff, being able to modify the server.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, you have the building blocks there with the smart assemblies. Being able to essentially modify the servers can be a very interesting concept for players to get into. I think there could be the possibility of manipulation if a corporation allies itself with using the smart assemblies to corner the market on a particular resource, perhaps, but we'll see.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we'll see indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans for freelance operations to be the main way new EVE Online players acclimate to that title?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Everyone who has watched EVE over these two decades knows we struggle with onboarding new people into the game. The most successful way has always been to use the current social infrastructure to onboard players, so now we're equipping those entities, the corporations, with better tools to recruit people.</p>
<p>This is a way for players to start working for a corporation without formally joining it, which often seems like a big step for people. Some people don't want to join a group without knowing something about them. This is a way to achieve that. We have high hopes that this will be the missing link to catch new players. Lots of people come to EVE Online for the first time every single year.</p>
<p><strong>With the freelance system, what mechanics are in place to prevent players from taking multiple jobs off the board and not completing them?</strong></p>
<p>Wow, you're going quite nitty-gritty.</p>
<p><strong>Griefing is always a concern with online games. It's human nature to kind of bend the rules.</strong></p>
<p>I will trust my design team, particularly the designer who made this, a legendary player in his own right, to have considered that while creating systems that are easy to understand but difficult to abuse. We have trained ourselves quite a bit in this. I don't know what the exact implementation is. He could give you the details about how he thought about that, but I can assure you he's very passionate about this particular system.</p>

He could give you the details about how he thought about that, but I can assure you he's very passionate about this particular system.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you know if multiple players can accept the same job?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>I know this is kind of a buzzword that's always tough to bring up, but blockchain technology has unfortunately been tainted with low-effort cash grabs and Web3 games that promise residual wealth and never deliver. What kind of real world applications does Web3 offer CCP Games?</strong></p>
<p>Weirdly enough, when we chose to use a database to make EVE Online, I got similar questions. They were like, databases are slow, they're mostly about banks, and they're boring, and like, why are you using a database to make a game? And I said, well, I'm making a persistent online game and I'm gonna make sure everything is properly stored and it's not going to get lost. Seems like a database is a good implementation.</p>
<p>And then we used the database and nobody thinks much of it today. We don't really sell EVE Online as like, the first database game. It was literally the first database game. Now there's another database, so to speak. And what we like about this database is that you can decentralise the database. We talk a lot about this kind of forever thing, and the centralization of data is a risk factor in anything forever. Anything centralised is more prone to a single point of failure than something that is decentralised.</p>
<p>The Internet itself is very decentralised for fault tolerance, so we like that aspect. Then we like the aspect of the blockchains that have been running now... I mean, let's look at Ethereum. It's been running since 2014, so it's over a decade, and it has open development on top of it in an adversarial framework. So, if somebody develops an application on Ethereum, they are in a way in competition with all the other applications on Ethereum.</p>
<p>So we want it, and it's largely held up technically on that level. We wanted to use that aspect to make a mod platform out of an MMO so that you could mod the server side of an MMO with both reads and writes. Because what we have seen in EVE Online where we have an API where people have built amazing things on top, largely by just reading data (you can actually write a little bit, but we are very careful about allowing writes because it's hard to manage it properly). But we wanted to build a platform where people could mod the server side of an MMO so that everyone could use the mod.</p>
<p>And when you run through the stack of things, that has to be true about any technology that allows for these two things: fault tolerant through decentralization, adversarially sound for economic warfare. Then you eventually end up with something like a blockchain.</p>
<p>I actually made that decentralised computing architecture in the 90s. It was my first gig coming out of university, which was to make a VRML browser in the late 90s in Iceland, actually, and we made a peer-to-peer system. Didn't have the cryptography, and thus we couldn't really make the transaction sound. We wanted to experiment. Can we supercharge the third party development/modding? Can we achieve fault tolerance through decentralization? Those are the reasons we're using it, and so far, so good.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Eventually, blockchain will absolutely be able to replay big EVE battles. There will be a footprint record of the blow-by-blow. You would just actually read the blockchain on your own note. You would just run a note and you could play through the state and make your own visualisation of that.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Many players hear about these legendary EVE Online corporation battles after the fact in news stories and videos. Could blockchain technology record a battle and let players watch a battle play out in real time?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Eventually, it will absolutely be able to do that. There will be a footprint record of the blow-by-blow. You would just actually read the blockchain on your own note. You would just run a note and you could play through the state and make your own visualisation of that.</p>
<p><strong>For EVE Vanguard, how have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-working-on-new-ue4-powered-fps-for-pc-as-dust-514-is-discontinued/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous failed attempts</a> at making an MMOFPS influenced this new take?</strong></p>
<p>There's a huge stack of stuff to that. I think probably the biggest lesson is that Dust 514 was a very big game. There were a lot of features, there was a lot of gameplay in the game. It was like a huge horizontal slice of a game, and because it was so big, we did not really have the time to make all aspects of it good. Now we're very much focused on that, on every single thing in Vanguard to be very good. All things are around gunplay and experience, moment to moment.</p>
<p>The shooter should just really be a great shooter. It should not lean on a crutch and because it has all these extra things, you can maybe excuse the shooting a little bit. I think that was the fundamental lesson. Another lesson is on the platform. It took a long time to get the performance where wanted on the PlayStation 3, which delayed it at the end of the cycle. The platform of choice now being PC, it's an easy thing to see after the fact. Doing it on a PC, which is our home ground, and making sure that every aspect of the game is rock solid before we start to scale up gameplay.</p>
<p>I think these are the primary points of what to learn from what didn't work out. Then, on the other side, what did work out is that people are still clamoring for Dust to come back, because this experience of playing a part in a grand adventure rather than just being a lobby shooter, nobody has delivered on that since Dust 514. You are taking part in a big, persistent, strategic war that's going to go on for decades.</p>
<p>By the way, I give Sony's massive props. We got waivers for everything under the sun to use our development methods on the PlayStation 3, and I think it actually taught Sony a lot about their own policies from working with us. Dust 514 was the first free-to-play game released on a Sony PlayStation console. There was a lot of trailblazing. Obviously, some of it was good and not all of it was good. We are ensuring we maintain what was good and address what was not.</p>
<p><strong>One of the aspects that I think drew a lot of players in was the promise that what you did in Dust 514 would be carried forward into EVE Online. So, can players expect further integration?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. What you do in Vanguard will echo in EVE forever.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share some examples of what might transfer between the two?</strong></p>
<p>If we think more of a future state, because this will take a while to work into, just like achieving the kind of Guinness World Record fleet fights we have now in EVE, it took a decade for players to organise themselves up until the point of getting thousands of people to fight together.</p>
<p>It's a major logistics, so in the future, we're planning for such logistics to span the solar system and the planets in the solar system to conquer territory in EVE Online. So, to conquer territory, you will have to go planet by planet to conquer the solar system. That means if you were a mercenary corporation in Vanguard, a single shot from one of your soldiers might topple an empire.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The shooter should just really be a great shooter. It should not lean on a crutch and because it has all these extra things, you can maybe excuse the shooting a little bit.

Doing it on a PC, which is our home ground, and making sure that every aspect of the game is rock solid before we start to scale up gameplay.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you feel that comparisons to Vanguard being an extraction shooter are apt, or would you consider it to be something else?</strong></p>
<p>Vanguard will feature a series of game modes. Some might be extraction-like, and some might be different. Right now, I don't know how many game modes we have. There are quite a few we're working on. The second tool that made it into the game wasn't even a gun; it was a mining laser. It speaks volumes that it's more than just about a combat experience.</p>
<p>The victory conditions of each mode will evolve drastically over time, because to play a part in the territorial conquest of EVE Online, you will need several types of commissions that you will need to implement in several game modes.</p>
<p>We don't even really think of them as game modes internally. They're more like a platform for gameplay experiences. It's a sandbox environment, and there are various reasons to enter it and various player motivations or purposes once you're inside it. Some are more combat-oriented, and some will have, as someone says, different victory conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Will corporations from EVE Online play a big part in Vanguard?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. You were talking about the freelance jobs earlier. Imagine some of the freelance jobs being for Vanguards. In the corporations, you'll have a whole suite of jobs you're delegating to all sorts of people all over space and on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>With the skinner system for ships, can you use those same colour palettes in Vanguard?</strong></p>
<p>I think eventually, what works in EVE will be brought to Vanguard and vice-versa, what makes sense, and I think the corporation palettes for sure. I think it will be a smashing success, but we will always base it on what really gets traction and usually what happens is that people start to request that to be brought to another game.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of bringing games elsewhere, has CCP Games considered bringing their PlayStation VR 1 catalog games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc&nbsp;</a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-valkyrie-project-arena-vr-hands-on-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Valkyrie</a>, to either the PlayStation VR 2 or the Meta Quest?</strong></p>
<p>We consider this every year, but right now we have our hands full with the games we're making. We just don't have the bandwidth to do with one.</p>
<p>For example, there was a period of time when CCP didn't have an active FPS that the public was aware of. That didn't necessarily mean that our ambitions to have an FPS in EVE had ever gone away. It's the exact same thing with this.</p>
<p>There's always something brewing at CCP, I can assure you.</p>
<p><strong>Who would win 100 new pros or a Titan?</strong></p>
<p>It should be such that 100 new pros can take down a Titan. It should be like that. It is a bit of a design premise of EVE that a bunch of new players should be able to take down any veteran in any circumstance. Whether it is practically like that right now, I think it depends a lot on the new pros. There are probably tactics where it could work, so the new pros would have to know about those. I think that absolutely virgin players off the street might struggle, but if players who really knew the game were to make a new character, they should be able to do it. If it isn't the case, then that is something to look into.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that all US&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>players will soon be required to verify their age if they wish to continue playing the gacha action RPG.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its official website, HoYoverse will require you to go through its age verification process to play <em>Genshin Impact</em>. The process&nbsp;will be rolled out to everyone across the US by May 20th.</p>

<p>You'll need to provide your age information by July 18th. Failure to do so will, according to HoYoverse, result in account suspension and "in-game friends and chat records" being deleted, as well as "no further notifications", since you won't be able to access your account anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-escoffier.jpg?itok=Jcl-vpYm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-escoffier.jpg?itok=ehjY6iKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>will soon require you to verify your age to play.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, if you don't verify your age by July 20th next year, your HoYoverse account's personal information "will be deleted permanently", so naturally, that's a fate you'll want to avoid.</p>

<p>This requirement likely comes as a result of <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a decision</a> made by the FTC back in January, wherein the commission found that HoYoverse "violated a children's privacy law and deceived children and other users" about in-game transaction costs and rare prizes in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s gacha system.</p>

<p>The decision required HoYoverse to cease selling "loot boxes" to children under 16 without their parents' consent and also to pay a $20 million fine to "settle FTC charges". It's likely the new age verification process is a direct result of that ruling.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the gacha systems in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</i>are very similar to those found in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, it doesn't seem that the ruling applies to those games; it's likely they'd need to be assessed as their own cases.</p>

It takes you back to the land of Mondstadt, where your adventure began, in order to enjoy an "interlude chapter" before the next story chunk proper gets going.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/black-mirror-bandersnatch-interactive-special-leaving-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bandersnatch - the interactive special from the Black Mirror team with a video game theme - is leaving Netflix.</p>
<p>Bandersnatch is about a young programmer who starts to lose his grip on reality as he sets to work adapting a dark fantasy novel into a video game. Set in the 1980s, Bandersnatch is described as a "mind-bending tale", which features multiple endings depending on the viewer's decisions.</p>
<p>It is a pretty interesting form of media which can get quite meta, and one that I restarted just now to have on in the background as I write this article.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you too want to relive the Emmy-winning Bandersnatch, you best do it sooner rather than later, because - as reported by <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/black-mirror-bandersnatch-and-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-interactive-specials-leaving-netflix/">What's On Netflix</a> - removal notices have appeared on both Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend. These last remaining interactive specials are set to leave Netflix on 12th May.</p>
<p>In November of last year, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-removing-almost-all-of-its-interactive-specials-but-dont-worry-bandersnatch-is-safe">Netflix spokesperson confirmed to Eurogamer that "almost all" of its interactive titles would be leaving the service that December</a>. "Only four will remain: Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild," Netflix told us at the time.</p>
<p>According to What's On Netflix, the company is going to be rolling out a UI redesign across various devices in the near future. Reportedly this redesign, which is still in the testing phase, is the reason Netflix has been phasing out its interactive specials.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unclear whether or not Bandersnatch will return to the service in some sort of non-interactive form, like the previously removed Bear Grylls specials which were <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-re-releases-bear-grylls-interactive-specials-as-linear-specials/">re-released on Netflix with a linear format</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Netflix for further comment on Bandersnatch's upcoming removal from the service.</p>

<p>The seventh season of Black Mirror recently made its debut. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-now-canonically-in-black-mirror">Along with a nod to Balatro</a>, the latest season also has its own crossover moment in the form of Thronglets, a companion mobile game tied to the episode Plaything.</p>
<p>"Thronglets, to me, feels like the gaming future Netflix wants," our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-you-might-not-even-notice-it">Bertie wrote after having a go with Thronglets</a>. "It's a fine example of how an additive brand-related gaming experience can be done."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Have you ever wondered what would happen if Super Smash Bros. was made into a roguelite? How would the chaotic arena battling of Nintendo’s finest platform brawler work within the rinse and repeat loop of Indie developer’s favourite genre? Those seem to be the questions Gentle Giant Games asked themselves. Their answer? Spiritfall.</p>
<p><iframe title="Spiritfall Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rSJdbb7kHrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With a bold Saturday-morning cartoon aesthetic, Spiritfall instantly charms the eyeballs. You play as a little dead dude with a flaming head who must battle and defeat a whole bunch of creatures and bosses to free the realm from bad stuff. Or something. Look, I have to admit, the plot held my attention for about as long as a TikTok video. It’s generic and hardly compelling, but thankfully it doesn’t get in the way and can mostly be ignored whilst you crack on with all the beat ‘em up fun.&nbsp;And what stupendously enjoyable gameplay it is!</p>


<p>From a map screen, you’ll choose which arena you want to enter next, mostly by appraising which of the many exciting rewards on offer will help you to complete your run. With that decision made, you’re straight into the action. Played from a 2D perspective, combat is fast, frantic, responsive and oh-so-silky smooth. Enemies will spawn and you get to hitting them with an abundance of style, as if Devil May Cry’s Dante went 2D. The more you hit your foes, the higher your combo meter builds and the more your victims bounce around the arena, obliterating themselves against walls, plunging off the edge of the level, or – even better – taking out a few of their evil chums in a satisfying chain reaction of explosions. Just like Super Smash Bros. it’s all about controlling the space, using your directional attacks and charged specials to send enemies flying before they can surround and overwhelm you.</p>


<p>Enemy types are wide and varied, each working with the other in interesting variations of attack pattens to try and catch you out. You thankfully have a very effective dash that will help you reposition to strike from safety, perhaps from a platform above or below, or with an arena wall to your back. The enemy hordes are constantly probing for a weakness in your strategy, leading to demanding dynamic combat encounters that keeps your fingers clicking and your eyes from never blinking. Frankly, it’s ridiculously addictive and kept me coming back for more as the hours rolled by.</p>
<p>This being a roguelite, there’s a conglomeration of power-ups that you get to keep for the run, and a whole bunch of collectibles you can gather to unlock permanent upgrades in the central hub. Spiritfall is delightfully generous in the rapid pace of the progress the player makes, as you are always rewarded with something by the spirits you meet. From damage-dealing dashes, the ability to shoot lightning bolts, or to set fire to the many minions you face, the configuration of character builds is bewildering in its vastness. Overall, the difficulty is configured just right for that one-more-run buzz, with upgrades coming thick and fast, ensuring you make enough progress each time to feel compelled to try again, rather than dispirited and put off by the reset back to the start.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>, there’s an entire armoury of weapons to unlock, each one encouraging a different playstyle and approach. There’s something for everyone, from a straightforward hammer, to a quartet of rapid-punching fists, a bow with long distance attacks or a very complicated chain scythe thingy. I’m sure in the hands of someone more skilled that latter would be deadly, however, in my clumsy hands things got very messy, so I went back to the safe embrace of the hammer instead.</p>
<p>Whilst the gameplay is thrilling and eminently addictive, the characters you meet are bland and empty merchants. Unlike the best examples of this form, there are no intriguing relationships to build here, everyone you come across has just a few limited text boxes to offer by way of characterisation, but little else. Thankfully the combat, pace, and deliriously compelling roguelite loop more than make up for this, resulting in a game that is perfect for the Switch and for facing another train delay with a smile on your face. After all, the lack of a train driver means there is time for another run after all.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-revealed.1183119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Nihon Falcom and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>release date, with the JRPG remake getting a worldwide release later this year.</p>

<p>Back in December, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that the game would be getting a simultaneous global launch sometime in 2025, and now, thanks to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, we know the date: it's coming on September 19th.</p>

<p>As previously revealed, the game will be getting a release on PC and PlayStation 5 as well as Nintendo Switch. It'll be available in two different editions: the standard version and the Bracer Box edition, although we don't yet know what comes as part of the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=7Pcdz7o4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=RKVN5pmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>launches in September.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, it's a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, which is itself part of the wider&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>series (which has been running for much longer than you'd imagine).</p>

<p>The game will tell the same story as the original; it'll follow the adventures of Estelle and Joshua Bright, two "bracers" (think problem-solving bounty-hunter types) who are quickly drawn into a "conspiracy that threatens the very heart of their homeland", according to Falcom.</p>

<p>Since it's a remake, though, you can look forward to improved visuals across the board, plus "refined gameplay" that will allow you to choose between turn-based combat and real-time fighting.</p>

<p>You can also expect new voiceovers in English and Japanese, and, of course, you'll have the option of choosing which one of the two you want, so you don't have to suffer through the English dub if you don't want to. I'm sure it's perfectly fine, but I'll be picking Japanese. Sorry.</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013078" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p>We just had to write this one up, because it’s not every day that you find out there’s going to be a new game for the Mega Drive – or Genesis if you’re of the American persuasion. Yes folks, someone has decided that releasing games on modern consoles is too passé, too easy, and instead decided that they’d bring a new title to a console that’s been dead and buried for nearly three decades. That game? Earthion, an old-school scrolling shoot ’em up, which will release on physical cartridge for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, alongside PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earthion Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PP59afi7FD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Even more exciting than a new cartridge, is the fact that it also boasts a 27-track soundtrack from legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro, whose previous works include Streets of Rage, ActRaiser and The Revenge of Shinobi. So, not only is it going to look like the 90s and come on a 90s cartridge, it’s going to sound like the 90s as well.</p>
<p>Earthion has been created by Japanese dev team Ancient Corporation – owned, in fact by Yuzo Koshiro – and it’s a space-themed 2D side scrolling shooter that sees you taking control of ace pilot Azusa Takahashi through 8 levels of space mayhem, each with unique environments, enemies and huge, screen-filling bosses.</p>


<p>This being a modern retro title, players will be able to configure scanlines and emulate CRT TVs when playing on modern platforms. Mega Drive players should be just fine without. There will also be mutiple difficulty levels, a challenge mode, a level password system and online leaderboards, though here the Mega Drive meets its match, and you’ll just have to get your friends round to compete against like in the good old days.</p>
<p>Earthion is due to arrive later this year for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. You can wishlist it now on Steam!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that Hazelight's co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, and the studio has also provided updates on when we can expect the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>games to arrive.</p>

<p>As part of its 2024-25 earnings report, EA reveals that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has sold "nearly four million units" since launching in March, although developer Hazelight <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> it had passed that mark.</p>

<p>This figure means&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has racked up another two million sales for itself since the beginning of March; the game reached the two million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">inside a single week</a>, having already reached a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">within its first 48 hours</a>.</p>

<p>As well as a sales update for&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, EA also revealed when we can apparently expect new&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>games to arrive; both are due to land in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which means EA has until March 2026 to release them.</p>

<p>EA has already been drip-feeding information about the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>via its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>, whereby it continuously requests community feedback in order to shape and inform the development of the game.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, EA originally announced it was coming to Early Access in 2025 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">last year</a>, although when it does, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't be launching with any kind of offline mode</a>, unfortunately. You'll have to look to Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> if you want offline skating sims.</p>

He’s trapped the boyfriend of the woman he loves in a creepy basement cage before poisoning him, killed his wife (who definitely tried killing him), broke into a woman’s home and sniffed her panties, and abandoned his son so he could fake his death.

Based on a real killer of the same name, Kempler would describe killing his grandmother just to know what it was like to kill someone with the type of methodical tone usually reserved for explaining a casserole recipe. Joe also had chillingly pragmatic reasonings for his murders, but he’s lost his cool on a number of occasions, showing the vulnerable humanity submerged under his psychosis. Kempler came across less as a sane human and more of a body that only exists to fulfill its murderous desires.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-recommend-id="image://99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Erzsebet Báthory looking devilish" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Erzsebet Báthory looking devilish" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-recommend-id="image://99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Erzsebet Báthory looking devilish" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t really a fair fight.

Joe is perpetuating incel behavior and toxic masculinity masked as love at a murderous level. Erzsbet is channeling ancient dark energy, usually from the blood of towns she’s had massacred, with the intent on bringing the apocalypse.

So, when Pablo had the depraved confidence to assassinate politicians knowing the governmental battle that would follow, it showcased a thirst for control that was dangerously blinding. If we’re talking evil, I would say flooding the home country you claim to love with a deadly drug, and even deadlier foot soldiers enforcing your rules to protect that drug empire is pretty evil. Joe’s killings were one at a time. Pablo bombed an entire flight that killed over 100 people, including children, without blinking an eye.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-recommend-id="image://0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-format="jpg" data-width="1486" data-height="991" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vecna ready to attack" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vecna ready to attack" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-recommend-id="image://0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-format="jpg" data-width="1486" data-height="991" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vecna ready to attack" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Similar to <em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em>’s Erzsebet Báthory, Joe is no match for a telepathic, otherworldly demon that can kill you without touching you. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-vecna-secrets-netflix-game-vr-1849752681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-vecna-secrets-netflix-game-vr-1849752681"><em>Stranger Things</em></a></span><em> </em>baddie Vecna’s (Jamie Campbell Bower) killings were disturbing because of how inhumane they looked.

He shot his own brother in cold blood after the man uncovered the truth, choosing loyalty to a murderous system over family.  This sicko loved the thrill of murder so much he disguised himself as a contestant in his twisted game only to shoot the same contestants he endeared himself to.

Joe Goldberg was a sadistic serial killer, stalker, and terrible erotica writer, but at least he didn’t have the governmental power to gut Social Security funds for millions or almost started a war with Russia to improve his public approval. Frank would probably be jealous of Joe trapping people in a soundproof cage, but what made Frank crazier than Joe was his willingness to treat millions of lives with reckless abandon and emotional indifference. Joe was a serial killer who confused obsession with love. Frank was a monster who knew the difference and relished in every death he caused. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that's now available for download for free introduces a highly requested feature that is only available in a limited capacity in the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Dresscode mod developed by YIIS, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1062?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a system that lets users change character outfits and weapons in-game dynamically. The tool not only supports all the base game outfits, requiring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1071">another mod</a> to unlock those not normally available via the changing booth, but also modded outfits, of which quite a few are available online. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="FF7R Dresscode Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbOMnUSq_UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth modding scene is not as big as that of other titles, plenty of great mods have been developed since the game's PC launch early this year. While the first few mods were, unsurprisingly, on the simple side, the unofficial additions made to the second entry in the remake trilogy have gradually become better and better, and have gone as far as adding completely new <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters</a>, such as the Turks Rude and Reno.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games released this generation by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

Sadly, though, we’re going to have to wait until May 26, 2026, to actually play Lucia and Jason’s story. So, in the meantime, why don’t we think about all of the Rockstar games we’ve already enjoyed over the years and rank them for fun?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has developed and released over 30 games since its creation in 1998, and is responsible for famous series such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Manhunt. But which comes out on top? Just to clarify, you won’t see the likes of LA Noire or Max Payne 2 here, as we’ve strictly gone with Rockstar-developed games, rather than ones the studio has published. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account my personal enjoyment of each game over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/screenshot-2025-05-07-at-12-08-59-1746616161781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 is simply my favourite game of all time, so it was a pretty easy S-tier pick for me if I’m honest. It’s (perhaps unsurprisingly) joined its predecessor and GTA 5 in that category – both pioneers of the cinematic open world genre. I also have a particular soft spot for Max Payne 3 and its bullet time ballet, as well as GTA San Andreas (a game I played at a way too young age). Down at the bottom in the D-tier, we have the likes of Austin Powers: Oh, Behave! and Welcome to My Underground Lair!, a game that literally nobody in their right mind wants to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Vice City is better than GTA 4? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of Rockstar’s games yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We may have only seen two trailers so far, but where do you think GTA 6 will end up ranking when all is said and done?

Eagle-eyed fans spotted that the presidents on the cash seen in a screenshot of the club in GTA 6 are the same as those from Red Dead Redemption 2’s cigarette cards (Thaddeus Waxman and Franklin Hardin).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this is an incidental detail, and GTA and Red Dead existing in the same universe does not amount to much at the end of the day (although some are now suggesting Jason may be a descendant of Arthur Morgan, given the two look sort of alike). But it shows that there are connections between the two Rockstar IPs that may be strengthened further when GTA 6 comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto some juicy stuff. There is a brief moment in the trailer early on when Jason walks into his house, and the camera moves into what looks like an over the shoulder, third-person perspective. There is little sign of gameplay in Trailer 2, but fans are theorizing that this cutscene may seamlessly transition into the beginning of GTA 6, with players thrust into controlling Jason as he walks around his house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it may be the case that GTA 6 features two of these sections: one for Jason and one for Lucia, the game’s second playable protagonist. The theory here is that GTA 6 will feature a similar transition into gameplay moment for Lucia, helping the player get to grips with the dual protagonist gameplay ahead of the time-skip to when Lucia leaves prison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on, fans are focusing their attention on an image transition on the recently updated official GTA 6 website, which sees the camera swing around from spotlighting Jason to spotlighting Lucia as they share an embrace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if this is a character select screen that might display when you load the game. The expectation is you’ll be able to swap between Jason and Lucia during gameplay, but perhaps GTA 6 gives you the chance to pick between the two upon getting back into the game, and if so, this could be what we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of theories on the nature of Jason and Lucia’s relationship and where the story will take it. I’ve seen everything from speculation that Jason is an undercover cop to either Jason or Lucia or perhaps even both dying at the end of the story. Most seem convinced either Jason or Lucia betrays the other at some point, which would be criminal. Perhaps we’ll get to choose via an optional ending system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a note on the Jason is a cop theory: Jason tells the prison security guard, when picking up Lucia, that he might have been there before. In what capacity? Later, an older cop says, “Us cops, we’ve got to protect each other,” before the trailer cuts to Jason shooting at a moving car.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This leads on to a theory that GTA 6 may feature a third playable character that Rockstar is keeping secret so it’s a surprise to fans, and that this older cop may be it. Could you shift perspective to a cop hunting down Jason and Lucia during the story?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is a brilliantly silly fan theory: previous GTA games are <em>films</em> in the world of GTA 6. Phil Cassidy, the arms dealer from Vice City and GTA 3, is at the heart of this theory. In those games he’s missing an arm, but there is a character seen on Jason’s TV during the GTA 6 trailer that looks a lot like Cassidy — except he has both arms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s happening here? If this is indeed Cassidy, then how does he have both arms? Could the GTA 6 Cassidy be Phil Cassidy’s son? Or his grandson?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding to the confusion is GTA's seperated universes structure. The GTA series is divided into three distinct parallel universes, officially named by Rockstar North as the "2D Universe", "3D Universe," and the "HD Universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2D Universe includes the original top-down GTA games developed by DMA Design. The 3D Universe starts with GTA 3 and includes its prequels, such as Vice City. And the HD Universe starts with GTA 4 and includes GTA 5, GTA Online, and the upcoming GTA 6, with each game set in the same year it was released. Following this, GTA 6 will be set in 2026, aka the modern day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, while these are meant to be distinct parallel universes, there is a lot of crossover between them, with shared place names, characters, some lore, and more besides. But certainly no-one was expecting Phil Cassidy from Vice City to pop up in GTA 6, as it makes the 'distinct parallel universes' thing even trickier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps having GTA’s 3D Universe games as films in the ongoing HD Universe would help resolve these issues. We do see what looks like Phil Cassidy on Jason's TV, after all. Or, this Phil Cassidy has nothing more than a fun Easter egg Rockstar added to GTA 6 to spark exactly this kind of speculation. This is Rockstar, after all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trailer 2 has also reinforced existing theories that GTA 6 will feature heists, and that there is a heavy influence from the Fast &amp; Furious movies. At one point we see a truck with a vault attached to it, similar to the Fast 5 scene that does pretty much the same thing.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Marvrassiczilla 🅰️🦖🦎🦍 (@Movie__Fans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Movie__Fans/status/1919772545617952866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More GTA 6 fan theories are popping up all the time as people dig into Trailer 2.

                <p>With Nintendo announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/">Mario Kart World as an $80 launch game</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft also confirming</a> that its first-party titles will be sold at the same price, it looks like gaming is about to get a lot more expensive. Similarly to how base video game prices increased from $60 to $70 starting in 2020, other publishers will likely start to charge more for their products, but EA isn't currently planning to join this trend.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A session of its Q4 and FY2025 earnings conference call, EA was asked whether it would adopt a similar approach to other companies and adjust its "pricing power" for key IP in the future. "Our business is very different today than it was even just 10 years ago," EA CEO Andrew Wilson explained.</p><p>"In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, well that's still a part of our business. It's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond. At the end of the day, whether we’re doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p><p>"From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current strategy at this point," EA CFO Stuart Canfield added. It's worth noting that EA makes a <em>lot </em>of money from microtransactions. EA recorded $5.34 billion in this department in its 2025 financial year, and in comparison, video game sales brought in $2 billion in sales.</p><p>These comments come on the back of EA's publication of its fourth-quarter results for the three months ending on March 31, 2025. Wilson said that the company "significantly exceeded expectations" thanks primarily to games like EA Sports FC in Q4, The Sims, and Split Fiction. Live-service revenue also increased by 1% to $1.42 billion during this quarter, The Sims experienced the best growth in the history of the franchise, and total Split Fiction sales are nearly double what EA expected from the Hazelight Studios-developed game.</p><p>At the same time, it hasn't been smooth sailing at EA, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/">as hundreds of workers were laid off</a> and two "early-stage" incubation projects at Respawn Interactive were canceled.</p>

                <p>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios has announced that it has reached an agreement with Plaion to acquire the publishing rights to the game. The company says that this deal will allow it to accelerate its content-development plans for Payday 3, and "pursue broader strategic opportunities" for the Payday franchise.</p><p>To secure the deal, Starbreeze issued $3.4 million in new shares--representing 10% of its outstanding share capital--with the bulk of the sales going toward repaying Plaion under its previous Payday 3 agreement and settling "certain outstanding" claims. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-enters-into-agreement-regarding-the-publishing-rights-for-payday-3-and-carries-out-a-directed-share-issue-of-class-b-shares-amounting-to-sek-33-million/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze has hinted</a> at new Payday projects in its announcement, as it'll continue to work with Plaion on "future Payday franchise" projects as part of its long-term strategy.</p><p>Following on the heels of the successful Payday 2, Payday 3 got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2023. The game was beset with various technical issues, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-sales-and-player-numbers-significantly-lower-than-hoped-for/1100-6521109/">low player numbers</a>, and a mandatory online-only requirement that proved to be very unpopular with the Payday community. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-ceo-is-gone-after-games-bad-start-and-low-player-numbers/1100-6521797/">Starbreeze's CEO Tobias Sjogren left the company in 2024</a> and the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-developer-knows-you-arent-satisfied-with-the-game-and-will-show-a-plan-next-month/1100-6520387/">announced plans to improve the game</a> through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-developer-knows-you-arent-satisfied-with-the-game-and-will-show-a-plan-next-month/1100-6520387/">various patches</a> as part of an effort titled Operation: Medic Bag.</p><p>Beyond Payday, Starbreeze is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dungeons-dragons-game-is-a-multiplayer-co-op-adventure-from-the-makers-of-payday/1100-6519684/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game for all major platforms</a>. Not much is known about the game, but it is expected to be released in 2026.</p>

                <p>If you've ever played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, you'll be familiar with the creeping overwhelm that can happen when returning to the game after a while, or if it's your first time playing. There are a lot of menu options, quests, triumphs, challenges, and more all housed within a complicated UI that many people seem to struggle to navigate easily. I recently returned to the game after a three-month hiatus and found myself blindly clicking to find the menus I needed--and that's as someone with more than 3,000 hours in the game.</p><p>During a reveal stream for the new expansion, The Edge of Fate, Bungie also outlined many quality-of-life upgrades and updates coming to the game. The most notable of these is a complete overhaul to the game's UI, which is now known as the Portal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858"></a><figcaption>The new Portal in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png"></figure><p>The Portal is a streamlined activity-selection screen, instantly showing the activities available at that time. There are different subsections within the Portal depending on the type of activity you want to play. These are split into Fireteam, Pinnacle, Crucible, and Solo Ops sections. Solo Ops is a new category that splits off smaller, shorter, self-contained gameplay sessions for those who want to play without the need for a fireteam.</p><p>You can also tailor the activities on offer depending on the rewards you're seeking. There are 50 new gameplay modifiers, which allow for the most customization in Destiny 2 so far. Activity rotations are now curated to provide variety and something new.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859"></a><figcaption>The Portal splits subsections into clear activities</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png"></figure><p>From looking at the improved UI and the introduction of the Portal, it's already clear that Bungie may have fixed the most frustrating problem with its space shooter to date. As an avid Destiny 2 fan I've found myself trying to convince my friends to jump in, but with a complex New Light experience that dumps new players into the game with little direction other than suggesting to follow a marker for a bit to see what happens, they were reluctant, to say the least.</p><p>Now, with the Portal, the next logical activity is highlighted in the bottom right of the interface, whether that's a new campaign mission, or the next activity you need in order to complete a specific quest or triumph.</p><p>The Portal will be added with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate release date</a>, which also introduces new Destiny 2 armor systems, weapons, and locations. The first of those new locations, Kepler, will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">customizable difficulty</a> options, further deepening your ability to play the game exactly as you'd like.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@grizzlybear1"> GRIZZLY BEAR</a>, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 VS GTA 5 GRAPHICS AND DETAILS COMPARISON" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ih0mVAGQfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise release of the game's second trailer</a>, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others.</p>
<p>Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a>, worldwide. The game was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/"> unsurprisingly</a> delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.</p>

            <p>Physical games remain vital to Nintendo players and developers should not "underestimate" this, an exec at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has said.</p>
<p>CD Projekt is currently getting ready to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">launch Cyberpunk 2077 on the Switch 2</a> and, unlike many games set to be released on Nintendo's new console, on its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch Cyberpunk 2077 will offer a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it.</p>
<p>This puts CD Projekt in the relative minority, as many other third party studios are instead favouring 'key cards' for their own Switch 2 releases. These key cards don't actually contain game data, and instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device.</p>

<p>But while there has been a general lean towards digital media over the past few years, CD Projekt says it has used its learnings from releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the original Switch when deciding upon a physical Switch 2 release for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>Having Cyberpunk 2077 as a "cartridge with a plug and play experience" on Switch 2 was "the right thing to do",   CD Projekt's VP of business development Jan Rosner told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>. The exec noted the original Switch's internal storage was "way lower than it is now", and a "game like The Witcher 3 would take up to 80 percent of your internal memory if you don't have an external memory card".</p>
<p>Nintendo players "are quite receptive" to that "plug and play experience", Rosner furthered, and so CDPR knew having a physical cartridge version of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 with no download required was "a goal that we wanted to achieve" from early on.</p>
<p>"Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere," he said, adding he doesn't see "a reality where we're just having all games digital" for a while yet.</p>
<p>"It's especially important for the Nintendo audience," the exec continued. "We maybe could have got away with [a key card], but is there a point? The right thing to do was to have it out on the cartridge with a plug and play experience."</p>
<p>Rosner advises other studios to "not underestimate the physical edition", saying this form of media is "not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CD Projekt</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the same conversation, Rosner said he believes that we will see "more and more third-party titles on the [Switch 2], which we may not necessarily expect" on the original Switch.</p>
<p>"The previous generation has proven to be so successful, and there [are] so many more players to be reached with that, and I think that the [console's capabilities] will surely allow it," he said.</p>
<p>This seems like a more than reasonable assumption. After all, along with Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Hazelight's Split Fiction will also be a Switch 2 launch title</a>. Other third party titles also confirmed for the platform include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a>, although these won't be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date">available on the console's release</a>.</p>
<p>So, with all that said and done, does it seem likely we will also see a Switch 2 version of The Witcher 3 further down the line? Well, the studio is skirting that question for now and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-the-witcher-3-get-a-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-skirts-issue-for-now-as-its-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077">CD Projekt told Eurogamer it is "all in on Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition" on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with Nintendo goes back to the original Nintendo Switch, where we released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We were happy with how that game was received by players so, when we heard about the more powerful Nintendo Switch 2, we immediately thought it would be the perfect platform for Cyberpunk 2077," CD Projekt's gameplay technical design expert Filip Downar told Eurogamer, adding that the studio was "thrilled" to be working with Nintendo again.</p>

The former is paid content while the latter will be available to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Rite of the Nine, a "fresh take on dungeon diving for both seasoned dungeon crawlers and those stepping into the depths for the first time" that is already available to all players for no additional cost. While the dungeons themselves — Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher, and Ghosts of the Deep — will be familiar to some, even the most hardened Guardian can expect "unique twists" in which you'll reconnect with Orin and refreshed dungeon weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on July 15, we'll get the brand-new expansion, Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate, a "multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions."

"Fireteam Ops and Pinnacle Ops reinforce quick fireteam action and longer-form cooperative content, while the new Solo Ops activities are specifically designed for solo players who want short, self-contained gameplay sessions without the need for a fireteam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, players can tailor activities to match their desired gameplay and the specific rewards they are chasing. 50 all-new modifiers will allow deeper gameplay customization and offer greater challenges for players, while curated activity rotations will ensure there is always something new to chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As typically happens with a new expansion, pre-order sweeteners are available, including an instantly unlockable Exotic Ghost and Legendary Emblem.

Alalshikh acquired American publication The Ring back in November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the tweet, the untitled game will feature original characters and combine "The Ring’s unmatched authority in boxing with game developer Dimps’ decades-long experience in crafting classic games."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Together with legendary Japanese video game designer Takashi Nishiyama, I am proud to announce a forthcoming boxing game presented by The Ring featuring original characters. </p><p>This strategic partnership between myself and Nishiyama brings together our unmatched authority in… <a href="https://t.co/LRWyyZzkpz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LRWyyZzkpz</a></p></div>— TURKI ALALSHIKH (@Turki_alalshikh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Turki_alalshikh/status/1919238688808051145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Dimps is Takashi Nishiyama’s company. Its most recent game was Freedom Wars Remastered, a reworking of a PlayStation Vita game for modern consoles released in January 2025. According to the tweet from Alalshikh, development of the boxing title will begin soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Saudi Arabian royal family has become increasingly invested in Japan’s gaming industry in recent years. In April 2024, it was revealed that 100% of Japanese game company SNK’s shares were now owned by the Saudi Crown Prince’s foundation. The Ring Magazine has also been involved in promoting SNK’s upcoming Fatal Fury: City of Wolves, hosting a <a href="https://www.boxxer.com/events/fatal-fury-chris-eubank-jr-vs-conor-benn-26-apr-2025-tottenham-hotspur-stadium-london/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>boxing match collaboration</u></a> at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London on April 26, 2025. Of course, Nishiyama himself previously worked at SNK in the 1990s, creating the Fatal Fury series and producing many games in flagship SNK series like Metal Slug and King of Fighters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Fighting Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese people’s reactions to the announcement of The Ring x Dimps collaboration so far have generally ranged from <a href="https://x.com/muuko_ht_e/status/1919361396342657243" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>surprised reactions</u></a> of “What?!!

It will be interesting to see whether The Ring and Dimps’ new boxing game goes for a realistic or rule-breaking approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
