            <p>
With one hand FromSoftware giveth (a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-big-new-patch-finally-lets-you-summon-torrent-to-fight-the-elden-beast">goat-horse in a more opportune location</a>, for instance) and with the other it taketh away; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s newly released 1.12 update has introduced a bug that can break things on Steam Deck - but FromSoftware says it's investigating.
</p>
<p>
As detailed on the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">developer's social media feed</a>, leaving Elden Ring inactive for too long on Steam Deck renders the game unplayable in some instances - something you'll probably want to be mindful of if you need to wander off and punch something, or have a little cry.
</p>
<p>
"A Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on," FromSoftware wrote on X. "Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than five minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs. We apologise for inconvenience." For what it's worth, I left Elden Ring running for multiple five-minute windows in the interests of science and had no problem resuming the game each time - so it's possible this isn't an especially widespread issue.

<p>
As for when a fix is likely, that's currently unclear, with FromSoftware only saying, "The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately."
</p>
<p>
Replies to From's announcement also include multiple reports of Steam Deck users being blocked from online after receiving a message announcing, "Inappropriate activity detected". The publisher is yet to acknowledge these reports, but hopefully concerned player will have more news soon.
</p>
<p>
In other Elden Ring news, its hugely anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is currently approximately 23 minute away from releasing. I'm now going to close my laptop, sit on the sofa, and stare at Steam until it arrives. Goodbye!

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I had never heard of <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> until I was starting to fill out my Genesis collection. This was back in the ‘00s when that was actually an affordable thing to do. It quickly became (and remains) my favorite game on the console.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">I didn’t understand why it wasn’t more talked about, but that was back when I thought that quality had a correlation with popularity. Oh, how naïve. Now that I’m older I realize that it’s all marketing and maybe sometimes people shouting, which is a form of marketing.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Now I’m going to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/by-the-wayside-rocket-knight-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shout at you</a> about <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em>. I’m going to tell you about the overall quality of the collection, but none of that matters. You should play <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em>, and this is your chance.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true"><strong>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection<strong><strong> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2728190/Rocket_Knight_Adventures_ReSparked_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rocket-knight-adventures-re-sparked-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10006837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10006837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a>)<br>Developer: Konami, Limited Run Games<br>Publisher: Konami<br>Released: June 11, 2024<br>MSRP: $29.99</strong></strong></strong></p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">The <em>Rocket Knight</em> series centers around an anthropomorphic opossum named Sparkster as he works to protect his kingdom, and usually its princess, from invasion. Each time, he faces off against his foil, Axel Gear, who seems motivated to just be a dick. That seems to be his only ambition. He partners up with the enemy each time and harrows Sparkster. There’s maybe an indication in the Genesis version of <em>Sparkster</em> that he just wants to test himself against the protagonist, but partnering with an invading force seems like going a bit far.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">I’m already off track. <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em>, contains <em>Rocket Knight Adventures, Sparkster, and Sparkster</em>. The former <em>Sparkster </em>is <em>Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2</em> for Genesis/Mega Drive, and the latter is <em>Sparkster </em>on the SNES.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Beyond that, the <em>Re-Sparked</em> collection has a music player and an art viewer with production documents. There’s also a boss rush mode, which is appropriate for these games. Really, the most striking part of the package is the fully animated cartoons interpreting the gameplay. Aside from that, these are straight ports from their home consoles with few bells and whistles.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Rocket Knight Re-Sparked! Collection | Launch Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AA8tRgYsXzQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Of the games, the original <em>Rocket Knight Adventures </em>is the standout. If I haven’t oversold it enough, it’s one of the best 16-bit platformers. All three games have Konami royalty behind them, but, well, we’ll get to what drags the other two down.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">With <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em>, however, it’s just a fun production. While the mechanics are straightforward, they get stretched in every direction. Each level presents something new and different, and it’s rarely just a platformer. One moment you’ll be jetting across the surface of a lake, and the next, you’ll be judging your jumps off the reflection of undulating water.</p> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="843" data-injectable="true">One particularly fantastic level has Sparkster assaulting an enemy airship. He’s fired out of a cannon and punches right through the side of the craft, like Doomguy in <em>Doom Eternal</em>. You travel a short distance through the interior before heading to the top, where you battle against intense wind. You move to the front of the airship before dropping down to the railings beneath it. You then return to the interior and move to the front to finish the boss off.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t let up. There are only a couple of issues. The first is that it’s really hard to gauge what kind of damage you’re doing. You can dash into enemies, hit them with your sword, or just hit them with a projectile that is fired when you swing your weapon. You can also spin in place, which sometimes just happens when you hit an enemy at the right angle. But what actually does more damage is hard to tell.</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Likewise, it’s pretty vexing that touching an enemy does significantly more damage to Sparkster than getting hit with a projectile. If your only option for getting out of the way of a projectile is to get danger-close to the enemy, it’s sometimes worth it to take the hit rather than risk getting brushed and taking twice the damage.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Lastly, there are limited continues, and to actually play the entire game, you need to be on “normal” difficulty. This wouldn’t be so bad, but the default difficulty is easy, so you have to know to check. Also, North America’s “normal” corresponds to Japan’s “very hard.” It’s not impossible, but it is deceptive.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">With the two <em>Sparkster </em>sequels, it looks like Konami’s marketing department or management got involved and gave the mandate “more like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>.” It’s rather obvious because Sparkster in <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> looks like a rat in a trash can, while in the <em>Sparkster</em> games, he’s all ‘tuded up. Stringy limbs, pointy ears, spikey hair; the works.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The artwork you can view in the collection really reinforces this. The sketches of Sparkster in <em>Rocket Knight Adventures </em>showed him snoozing or snacking on apples. There are early design documents for <em>Sparkster</em> that changed his design, but not in such an aggressive <em>Sonic</em> kind of way. I preferred him looking more earnest than cool.</p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">I would have loved to hear about how these changes came to be, but even if the <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em> had interviews (which it doesn’t), I doubt they’d really include talks of corporate meddling.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">The Sega Genesis version of <em>Sparkster</em> goes further to imitate Sonic. The levels are more open and have more exploration involved. One of the side goals is collecting seven swords scattered throughout the levels, and doing so powers up Sparkster and turns him gold. To be fair, <em>Sonic</em> just lifted that from <em>Dragon Ball</em>, but it’s more obvious when an anthropomorphic rat with spikey hair does it.</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, Genesis <em>Sparkster</em> has a cold opening that involves fighting Axel Gear in a robot suit. It’s so easy to lose that you may think this is a scripted defeat to set up their rivalry, but you are actually supposed to win it in order to get the first sword. Pro tip.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">As for SNES <em>Sparkster</em>, it’s mostly fine. You’re fighting wolves, and if you hit them, they get knocked out of their armor and display their chiseled physique.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">It follows the same ‘tuded up design as Genesis <em>Sparkster</em>, but the levels are more linear and there are no swords to collect. It’s an above-average platformer and does feature some variety and ambition, just nowhere near as much as the original.</p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">That’s kind of the issue with the two <em>Sparksters</em>. They’re competent, but they only have a fraction of the soul of the first game. The changes in visual design just put a big spotlight on this.</p>
 <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">As for Limited Run Games’ <em>Resparked </em>collection, I once again have to wonder why I can’t rebind the controls. I understand that, on console, most people just use the stock controller configuration, but is it really that hard to allow the option to change it? I’d suspect not since the original versions of the games allow you to change the bindings which, for some reason, they removed from the versions in this release. I’m so frustrated, I just want to play with a Genesis-like controller.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">Aside from that, these are basically just emulated versions of the game. I feel like the main point of these collections is to make the games available on a modern platform. Any changes made are rarely impactful. For example, updating the graphics on <em>Gargoyles</em> didn’t suddenly make it a better game. The rewind and save states are appreciated, and I found the included production art very interesting to look at.</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">There isn’t anything mindblowing here. I would have loved to see interviews with the staff or design documents beyond just concept art, but I guess that wasn’t in the cards. The only thing that really elevates the <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em> beyond, say, the recent <em>Felix the Cat</em> collection is mainly the animated openings and the boss rush modes. The entire collection is rather pricy for three emulated games. It is, for comparison, $10 more than the <em>Castlevania Anniversary Collection</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, if you get anything from this review, it’s that <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> is an underappreciated classic, and you should definitely play it. The two <em>Sparkster</em> games are more Sparkster, but more disposable and with a feeling of cynicism. Whether you wait for a sale is your decision. <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em> is fine, just play <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> already.</p>
 <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="79" data-injectable="false"><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</sub></p>

For about ten bucks, you can cop <em>Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2</em>, <em>Dragon Age Inquisition </em>and all of the major DLCs and expansions for each title. I repeat, ten bucks will get you everything you need to get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">caught up before <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>.</p><p>Before jumping into the series, you should know that the <em>Dragon Age </em>games are…an unwieldy bunch to say the least. Though some have been released to critical acclaim, like <em>Inquisition</em>, others have not, and time has been equally gracious and cruel to the wider series. One of the larger problems that seems to have held the games back in the past is that it felt like <em>Dragon Age </em>lacked a cohesive vision underpinning the whole thing. For example, <em>Origins </em>is a harcore CRPG and you should never play it on console like I did (twice), whereas its immediate sequel was a much more intimate and downsized action-RPG with light CRPG elements.</p><p>However, experiencing the series firsthand, as opposed to via some lore recap, will be handy. The first game deals heavily with the Grey Wardens, a faction that has remained a large part of the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. One of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857/slides/9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857/slides/9">companions in <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span> belongs to this faction, and so you may as well learn all about them firsthand. The second game introduces <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">Varric</a></span>, who has become a major (not to mention beloved) character over the course of <em>Dragon Age 2 </em>and <em>Inquisition</em>, and he seems to be play a big part in <em>The Veilguard</em>,<em> </em>too. <em>Inquisition </em>is the most important game of the bunch to play, if only because it and its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC explicitly establish the main conflict and antagonist of the forthcoming game.</p><p>While each of the games is stylistically distinct from the others, they have largely tried to tell the same ongoing story of the mage-templar conflict that has ripped Thedas several new ones over the course of three games and several DLCS. The latter two dive into this matter in more depth, and considering we’ll be heading to the Tevinter Imperium—an oft-mentioned corner of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s world—for the first time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’re going to want to know the role it has played in the ongoing political tensions of the world.</p><p>This incredible sale on the <em>Dragon Age </em>games ends on June 24 at 1 PM ET, so you’ve got the weekend to consider what else in your life <em>really </em>needs those ten dollars. I already own the games and even I’m biting the bullet again to have them on a better platform. What’s your excuse?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="221" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Daniel Radcliffe, known famously for portraying the protagonist in the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies, has shared that he would love to see the final Harry Potter book and the movies being adapted for the upcoming <em>Harry Potter</em> show.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">After winning his first Tony award, Radcliffe was asked by <a href="https://people.com/daniel-radcliffe-reveals-harry-potter-book-he-is-most-excited-to-see-adapted-in-tv-series-8664233">People</a> in an interview about which book he’s most excited to see the show adapt. He said, “The last one, I mean, it’ll be a while before they get to that, I assume, but that was always one of my favorite of the books and of the films.”</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">For those unfamiliar, the final <em>Harry Potter</em> book was <em>The Deathly Hallows</em>, and its story was split into two movies to end the <em>Harry Potter</em> saga. The reboot series will adapt all seven <em>Harry Potter</em> books from J. K. Rowling.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Harry Potter Max Original Series | Official Announcement | Max" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o07u0uKkV_g?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">Radcliffe is right about the wait, since the show is <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently going to run for 10 years</a>. Moreover, the <em>Harry Potter</em> show adaptation will premiere in 2026 on HBO’s Max. Taking that release window into account and time needed to get there, it would be a while.</p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="false">As for the fans who are hoping for a Daniel Radcliffe cameo in the show, the actor has shut down the idea twice in the past. He previously told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1402023/will-daniel-radcliffe-join-the-harry-potter-tv-series-he-says">E! Online</a> that he does not think there is a cameo for him in the show since the show has to be a “clean break”. The actor also shared with <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reboot-tv-show-hbo-max-return/">ComicBook</a> in 2023 that he is “very excited to have that torch passed” and feels that there is no need to “physically pass it” with a cameo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-oathbreaker-paladin-build-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-oathbreaker-paladin-build-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="155" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Oathbreakers are the quintessential evil paladins, and there’s almost no better class to choose when doing a dark playthrough of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">In the tabletop version of <em>D&amp;D </em>5th edition, the Oathbreaker class was included in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>and intended for villainous NPCs, but the class has caught on with players in a big way. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-paladin-update-patch-9-news/">Oathbreakers came late to <em>BG3</em></a>, but Larian clearly understood what made the class such a hit at the table. Paladins are already massively powerful half-casters that can smite their enemies with glee, but the Oathbreaker subclass adds some undead magic and dark power to the mix.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-break-your-oath" data-injectable="false">How to break your Oath</h2> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">One does not simply start out as an Oathbreaker Paladin. You’re going to have to choose a different Paladin subclass and then break your Oath once the game gets going. It doesn’t matter what you choose because your Oathbreaker features replace whatever you start out as. </p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">The easiest option here is to start as an Oath of Vengeance Paladin, then talk Arka out of killing Sazza when you reach the Emerald Grove. You can also get the ball rolling by killing an innocent person as an Oath of Devotion Paladin, or an innocent animal if you took the Oath of the Ancients.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-best-race-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best race for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">The good news is that you can’t really pick a bad race for an Oathbreaker. That said, you should remember that even though Oathbreakers can cast spells, they’re really melee fighters. Because of that, Githyanki and Half-Orc Oathbreakers are going to be extra powerful. Githyanki get psionics and mobility options, and Half-Orcs have Relentless Endurance and Savage Attacks. Crafty or skull-crushing, the choice is yours.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-ability-scores-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best ability scores for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">Oathbreakers need to make sure they have a good mix of Strength, Constitution, and Charisma scores. The former pair helps Oathbreakers become masters of melee combat and the latter makes sure Oathbreakers can use the handful of spells they unlock as they progress. Here’s the setup I’d recommend at character creation:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Strength </strong>– 17</li> <li><strong>Dexterity </strong>– 10</li> <li><strong>Constitution </strong>– 14</li> <li><strong>Intelligence </strong>– 8</li> <li><strong>Wisdom </strong>– 10</li> <li><strong>Charisma </strong>– 15</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-best-background-for-an-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best background for an an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">The best backgrounds for Oathbreaker Paladins make good use of the Charisma attribute. Paladins need high Strength for their weaponry, but they also need a reasonably high Charisma for all their magic. Since you’re already going to have a high Charisma score, you might as well pick a background that gives you some social skill proficiencies. You can choose one that boosts your Persuasion and helps mitigate a low Intelligence/Wisdom score, or you can embrace your weaknesses and focus on terrifying and pummeling your foes.&nbsp;</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Guild Artisan </strong>– Insight, Persuasion</li> <li><strong>Haunted One </strong>– Medicine, Persuasion</li> <li><strong>Noble </strong>– History, Persuasion</li> <li><strong>Soldier </strong>– Athletics, Intimidation</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-feats-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best feats for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">When it comes to picking feats, Oathbreakers are in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-feats-for-paladin-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/">the same boat as all the other Paladins</a>. Depending on the build, Oathbreakers only get 2-3 feats, and it’s tempting to only take ability score increases because you need to boost both Strength and Charisma. Items can help you smooth out those scores, however, so these are the feats I’d recommend considering:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong> – You really should take at least one to boost Strength. The more often you hit, the more often you Smite.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Great Weapon Master</strong> – This should take your second feat slot, since it greatly increases the chance you have to get in multiple attacks each turn.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Alert </strong>– Going earlier in initiative is always great, but this should really only be a pick if you choose not to multiclass.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-best-multiclass-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best multiclass for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Oathbreakers are a bit limited when it comes to multiclassing because their signature ability – Animate Dead – doesn’t become available until 9th level. There are still some good multiclass options, though, especially if you’re willing to give up that particular spell.&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Oathbreaker 9, Warlock 3</strong> – This is the route to go for Oathbreakers that want a little bit of everything. You have enough Paladin skills to jump into melee combat and start Smiting your enemies, but you can also save spell slots by leaning on your Charisma modifier with Eldritch Blast while letting your Animate Dead servants do the grunt work. Take Paladin first level, then do your Warlock dip before finishing out your Paladin levels.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Oathbreaker 7, Bard 5</strong> – Multiclassing with a College of Sword Bard is always a fantastic option for Paladins. They already have the Strength needed to make great use of the College of Sword’s new attack abilities, and all the Bard’s spell slots can be turned into Smites to really dump on the damage. Going this route sacrifices Animate Dead, but by taking Paladin up to level 7 you can still get all your Channel Oaths and the Aura of Hate damage buff for you and your allies.&nbsp;Once again, you’ll want to start as a Paladin to get proficiency in every type of armor, then you can push to level 4 to get a Feat before starting your multiclass. </li> </ul>

  <p id="fya02f">The original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/31/21350181/beyond-good-evil-movie-netflix-director"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> is getting a 4K overhaul for its 20th anniversary, Ubisoft announced Thursday during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3umAZ-nvM">Limited Run Games showcase</a>. <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</em> will bring updated graphics, controls, and audio to the beloved original.</p>
<p id="uFNYe5"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</em> will feature improved performance — “up to 4K, 60 fps,” Ubisoft said — and quality-of-life improvements including auto saves, cutscene skipping, controller and keyboard-and-mouse support, and cross-save across all platforms. All-new features include a speedrun mode, 20-plus new achievements and trophies, and a gallery that delves into the original game’s development with never-before-seen artwork and videos.</p>
<p id="6VZB0T">The <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> re-release may not be much of a surprise to longtime fans; the game’s existence (and even an unfinished version of the remaster itself) leaked last fall.</p>

<p id="W4Mqmp">The original <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> was released in 2003 on GameCube, PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. Set more than 400 years in the future, the story of <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> follows photojournalist Jade in her attempt to expose an alien conspiracy. Despite being a commercial miss, the game became a cult classic over the years. In 2017, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/22/15855920/beyond-good-evil-2-gameplay-e3-demo">Ubisoft announced a prequel named <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em></a>, but the publisher hasn’t said much about it lately. The <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/after-more-than-ten-years-its-still-too-soon-to-say-when-beyond-good-and-evil-2-might-be-out/">last official word on <em>BG&amp;E 2</em> came in 2021</a>, when Ubisoft said the sequel was still in development. But the stars of <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> — Jade and Pey’j — recently appeared in Ubisoft’s animated series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23922741/captain-laserhawk-netflix-ubisoft-review-cartoon-tv"><em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em></a>.</p>
<p id="QFI92O"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</em> will be released digitally on June 25, on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. A physical version (and a collector’s edition) will be released by Limited Run Games. Pre-orders for the physical versions of <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</em> will go live on July 12.</p>

Now, however, many players returning in advance of the imminent DLC aren’t able to enjoy <em>Elden Ring</em> on Steam Deck. </p><p>On June 20, Namco Bandai and From Software released update 1.12 for <em>Elden Ring</em>, which is needed to play the new DLC. However, it seems this update has broken the RPG on Steam Deck, with some players reporting that they can’t even connect to the servers to play <em>Elden Ring.</em> Others are reporting an odd bug where <em>Elden Ring</em> might just stop accepting inputs if you leave your Steam Deck idle for more than five minutes.<br></p><p>On Thursday, the official <em>Elden Ring </em>Twitter account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged the input bug</a></span> shortly after the update went live. It confirmed that the team was aware of the problem on Steam Deck and was already working on a hotfix. No release date or window was provided for when to expect this update, though the developer did “apologize” to Steam Deck players for the “inconvenience.”</p><p>I assume many players who bought <em>Elden Ring</em> on Steam Deck have access to a decent PC where they can play the game until the hotfix is live. But for those who don’t have a gaming PC and own <em>Elden Ring </em>on the Steam Deck, this is a crappy situation that hopefully will be fixed soon.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-print-and-play-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a wonderful charm to the nature of print-and-play <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. Whether free or available for a small fee, these do-it-yourself designs offer full experiences that rival professionally published titles. In fact, many hit games started off as print-and-play offerings, including The Resistance, Monikers, and Gloomhaven: Buttons &amp; Bugs. Clearly, this minified format does not hold back a stellar game or stifle its creativity.</p><p>The nine games on this list are some of the best print-and-play offerings currently available. This is a genre that boasts thousands of options, so whittling the list down to a select few proved quite a challenge. The end result is an array of titles that will suit varied tastes and proficiencies. So fire up the inkjet and pull out the scissors.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: The Best Print-and-Play Board Games</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#deep">Deep Space D-6</a></li><li><a href="#bloc"><u>Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game</u></a></li><li><a href="#for"><u>For Northwood!</u></a></li><li><a href="#voy">Voyages</a></li><li><a href="#net"><u>Netrunner: System Gateway</u></a></li><li><a href="#table"><u>Table Battles</u></a></li><li><a href="#head"><u>Heading Forward</u></a></li><li><a href="#two"><u>Two Rooms and a Boom</u></a></li><li><a href="#circle"><u>Circle the Wagons</u></a> </li></ul><h2 id="deep">Deep Space D-6</h2><div id="202226"><p><h3>Deep Space D-6</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 min</li></ul><p>A large swathe of print-and-play games target <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo play</a>, and Deep Space D-6 is one of the best. This game puts you in the role of captaining a United Earth's Fleet starship responding to a distress call. Warping into the sector, you quickly realize it was a trap and have now been ambushed. Your only response is to start rolling dice.</p><p>Each turn you roll crew dice and assign them to various stations on your spacecraft. You must split your concentration between internal and external threats, as you will face boarding parties as well as opposing ships. With several ship options, a multitude of threats, and various tactical considerations, Deep Space D-6 boasts a solid amount of depth in a little package.</p><h2 id="bloc">Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game</h2><div id="202227"><p><h3>Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 13+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2-4</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 120-180 min</li></ul><p>This is the most complex and rich board game on this list. Bloc by Bloc is a semi-cooperative political experience about fighting a revolution. Players control factions of workers, students, neighbors, or prisoners, and utilize their force to combat the State. It’s a very fierce affair that embodies the use of violence to curb tyranny.</p><p>This is a multi-layered design that features hidden agendas, area control, and a high degree of asymmetry. Play occurs over multiple nights, with each participant executing actions and then bracing themselves for the game-controlled police response. It’s a fascinating game, and one that bears a striking theme. The cute facade and buffer between realistic depictions provide a touch of levity and blunt the game’s edge. This is a fantastic example, however, that board games can tackle serious topics and themes beyond surface-level violence and adventure. </p><h2 id="for">For Northwood!</h2><div id="202228"><p><h3>For Northwood!</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 15-30 min</li></ul><p>For Northwood presents the novel concept of a solitaire trick-taking game. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games">trick-taking game</a> genre, epitomized by titles such as Spades and Euchre, is a classic style of card game that has seen a huge resurgence in recent years. For Northwood takes this idea and translates it to a single player experience that is surprisingly effective.</p><p>The goal here is to peacefully unify the kingdom of Northwood. Each trick represents a conversation with Northwood’s rulers, playing out as a series of tense negotiations. This is such a clever format to present this idea, and it works wonderfully to inject a bit of drama and context to the card play. The approach is ultimately playing cards against a mindless opponent, the challenge level can get very high. You’re forced to make difficult decisions about when to use special once-per-game abilities, and you must manage your hand deftly to succeed. This is a winner, and a very easy game to print out and assemble.</p><h2 id="voy">Voyages</h2><div id="202229"><p><h3>Voyages</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1-8</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20-30 min</li></ul><p>The popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games"><u>roll-and-write</u></a> genre of games has players rolling dice and then marking up personal sheets to cross off boxes, mark off numbers, or color in spaces. Voyages has players use dice rolls to sail a ship across an open sea. The goal is to visit different islands and gather goods to deliver to various destinations. </p><p>Like many roll-and-write games, the experience shifts substantially with new sheets and layouts. There is a wide variety of sea maps to choose from, creating unique strategic challenges that demand clever sailing. This is a breezy game that is playable by a large number of players simultaneously. It requires a very modest amount of effort to print and assemble, and is one of the most accommodating games on this list. The gameplay is more worth the trouble, as Voyages is an excellent print-and-play design.     </p><h2 id="net">Netrunner: System Gateway</h2><div id="202230"><p><h3>Netrunner: System Gateway</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 45 min</li></ul><p>Magic: The Gathering designer Richard Garfield released the two-player cyberpunk hacking CCG Netrunner<em> </em>in 1996. It was later re-envisioned by Fantasy Flight Games as Android: Netrunner in 2012, cementing its legacy as one of the best card games ever made. Unfortunately, it officially went out of print in 2018, closing the doors on any future development and leaving a huge fanbase hanging in the wind. Or so we thought. </p><p>A group of fans has revitalized Netrunner in a completely free-to-play format, offering professionally illustrated card sets that continue the legacy of this astounding game. While the new card sets are free to print on your own, you can also purchase professionally printed decks online. The quality of artwork and game design is remarkable. It’s as if the game never died. Additionally, you can even acquire reworked versions of old cards, making for a very complete and nuanced game that is completely accessible from your computer. System Gateway is the starter set, a wonderful collection of cards that plays superbly.</p><h2 id="table">Table Battles</h2><div id="202231"><p><h3>Table Battles</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20 min</li></ul><p>Amabel Holland is an enigmatic designer who has produced dozens of quirky and unusual titles from her co-owned studio <a href="https://hollandspiele.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollandspiel</a>. Table Battles is one of her most successful systems, offering a light and streamlined <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a> that is flexible to cover many different eras of history. It’s fueled by a central dice activation system where players allocate rolled dice to unit cards in order to later activate and attack with them.</p><p>While this game is easy to pick up and learn, there is a degree of depth through tactical options such as counterattacking, utilizing strategic reserves, and screening attacks to cancel them. It’s a tense game where thoughtful maneuvering is paramount to success. This base set includes battles ranging from 1458 to 1776, but there are follow-up titles that cover the War of the Roses, the American Civil War, and even fictional setups such as Dinosaurs and Kaiju. </p><h2 id="head">Heading Forward</h2><div id="202232"><p><h3>Heading Forward</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 min</li></ul><p>Another Hollandspiel title, Heading Forward is a very weird game about recovering from a brain injury. This solitaire design has players exploring rehabilitation from a terrible accident. You must relearn skills such as planning, shopping, and returning to work. All of this must be accomplished in a limited time as your insurance company will only fund your recovery for a defined timeframe.</p><p>To develop these skills you must rotate and swap out cards. They upgrade from weak level one skills all the way up to level four. Improving your acumen requires managing emotional and physical energy, as well as other resources. The road is fraught with setback, however, as hiding in the deck is a trigger card. This reignites the trauma of your accident and marks a major setback. This game one again displays that board games can reach for something greater. It’s based on designer John du Bois’ own recovery, and is a very intimate and memorable experience.</p><h2 id="two">Two Rooms and a Boom</h2><div id="202233"><p><h3>Two Rooms and a Boom</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 8+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 6-30</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 min</li></ul><p>Two Rooms and a Boom is one of the best social deduction games ever designed, and it’s thankfully available in a print-and-play format alongside the professionally published version. This is one of those <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party games</a> that works best with a large crowd. It excels with groups of 10 or more, as players are dealt secret cards that split them between two teams. All of the players are then divided between two rooms which are isolated from each other.</p><p>The blue team wants to protect one of their own, the President. The red team wants to ensure the player on their team that occupies the role of the bomber ends up in the same room as the President at game’s end. Over multiple rounds, each room will select players to be exchanged with the other location. At the end of the game, if the President is in the same location as the bomber, then the red team wins. If this doesn’t happen, the blue team succeeds. It’s simple but wildly entertaining. Players can secretly or publicly reveal their role cards. Cliques are established quickly and much negotiation occurs. Everything radically changes when new roles are added, such as players which are not allowed to show their role, ones which may only lie and never tell the truth, and ones with alternate private victory conditions. This is a fantastic game with a large amount of depth and variability that is sure to please a large crowd.</p><h2 id="circle">Circle the Wagons</h2><div id="202234"><p><h3>Circle the Wagons</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 8+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 15 min</li></ul><p>This head-to-head card game has players developing their own prosperous town. The core of the game hinges on a unique draft system, where available cards are placed in a circle at the center of the table. Players take turns plucking cards from this circle and placing them in their own personal towns. </p><p>One wrinkle of the game is a set of three cards at the center of the circle. This trio dictate bonus ways to score when building towns and should not be ignored when formulating strategy. This is a clever little game that is enhanced by a large degree of variability. There is a plethora of combinations in card placement, and each session doesn’t quite work out the same way.      </p><p><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

It'll also have a single-player mode featuring actor Casper Van Dien reprising his role as Johnny Rico from the original Starship Trooper film.

The game also missed the actual 20th anniversary at the end of 2023, but better late than never! Ubisoft has released the launch trailer for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, which shows a new generation of gamers what they can expect to see.</p><p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil was originally released in 2003, and it put players in the role of Jade, an investigative reporter and spy who lives on a mining world called Hillys in the 25th century. When her world comes under attack by aliens known as the DomZ, Jade accepts an assignment to catalogue the species of Hillys before she is drawn even deeper into the ongoing invasion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition: Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The original version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil was pulled from most of the online gaming storefronts ahead of the new edition. Some of the features of the 20th Anniversary Edition include upgraded graphics, controls, and audio, as well as 4K support and an anniversary gallery. There will also be a new "treasure hunt" that reveals more about Jade's childhood. According to Ubisoft, this mission will also include "a narrative link" to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-says-beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-progressing-well/1100-6483947/" data-ref-id="1100-6483947">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>, the sequel which has been in development for a very long time.</p><p>Ubisoft briefly pulled the trailer for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition because it accidentally preempted Limited Run Games' announcement of a physical edition later this year. Fans who only want the digital version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil won't have to wait that long. It will be available on all platforms starting on June 25.</p>

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/dragon-age-4s-new-name-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-gameplay-look-next-week">BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Ahead of that announcement, <em>Game Informer</em> visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story</a>. It's here we learned that the name had changed.</p>

<p>I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>BioWare's Leads On Changing The Name To Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</strong>: "First of all, I would say that these games are reflections of the teams that make them, and as part of that, it means we learn a lot about what the heart and soul of the game really is as we're developing it. And we quickly learned and realized that the absolute beating heart of this game are these authentic diverse companions. When we took a step back, as we always do, we always check our decisions and make sure that they still represent the game we're trying to build. It just felt like we needed a title that represented what this game was truly about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I want to be clear: I adore Solas [and] he plays an important role in the game, but this is not a game about Solas. So in all things we do, trying to capture that authentic experience, we felt the title really needed to change."</p>

<p><strong>Veilguard creative director John Epler</strong>: "Dragon Age has always been about characters, not just the villains, but also your team, your companions, the other characters in the world. And as we were building Dragon Age: The Veilguard – there's this analogy I like to use, which is, 'If you want to carve an elephant out of marble, you just take a piece of marble and remove everything that doesn't look like an elephant.' As we were building this game, it became really clear that it was less that we were trying to make The Veilguard and more like The Veilguard was taking shape as we built the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solas is still a central figure in it. He's still a significant character. But really, the focus shifts to the team. It's about the people you recruit. It's about stopping the end of the world with this group of specialists, these incredibly interesting and diverse characters that you recruit into your team. [We] realized Dreadwolf suggests a title focused on a specific individual, whereas The Veilguard, much like Inquisition, focuses more on the team."</p>

<p><strong>BioWare general manager Gary McKay</strong>: "First, let me say: Solas is still very much part of this game. This is absolutely nothing to say that he's taking a back seat. But when we reflected on what was really the heartbeat of this game, we really saw the companions jumping out at us. I think you could argue [these companions] are the best the franchise has ever seen. We have seven incredibly unique characters, each with their own personalities, motivations; they have deep stories, and you have an opportunity to really interact with these characters in a way that both shapes their story but also influences the main story, right down to having an opportunity to impact their fate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just the story; they are also integral to the gameplay as well. And so when you look at it from really what the heartbeat of this game is, the centerpiece of the game, it's about the companions – the Veilguard. We felt that the title needed to reflect what we thought the centerpiece of this game was."</p>

<p><strong>Former Dragon Age executive producer and Veilguard consultant Mark Darrah</strong>: "I think it's absolutely the right choice. Names can take on a momentum. Arguably, this game has kind of, in a way, been called Dreadwolf to some degree since its earlier days. As the game evolved, as [BioWare] figured out exactly what it was, it's very mature to step back and say, 'We called it something. Does it really still reflect what the game is?' And I think the fact the team was willing to take that step is amazing, and I think this is absolutely the right decision."</p>

</article><p>When I ask about Solas' role in the story after I learn his namesake is no longer in the game title, Darrah says Veilguard is still taking the Elven God's narrative in a good direction. He adds, "It allows us to, hopefully, give a good conclusion to all the varied attitudes toward Solas that are going to be coming from people who love Solas, who agree with Solas, who hate Solas, people who want to kick Solas off of a building – I think that we give you the opportunity to bring that to a close, but then tell a greater story about The Veilguard and about the world as a whole."</p>

<p>Talking to Epler, I learn more about how Solas isn't exactly the big bad I expected before seeing the opening hours of Veilguard. There's a lot more nuance to everyone's favorite bald elf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The most interesting villains to myself, and honestly most people, are not just straight up, 'I want to end the world.' To them, they are the heroes of the story, and Solas is no exception," Epler tells me. "Solas always feels that he is a tragic hero but a hero nonetheless, so he's coming into this believing firmly that what he did, that which you stopped him from doing, was the right thing – that you made a mistake. But now he's trapped and can't reach out and actively affect [Thedas], so he needs to work with you.</p>

<p>"That allows us to provide a lot of nuance to that relationship," Epler says.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>If you're wondering what Epler means when he says Solas trapped, it's quite literal – in the game's prologue, which is part of the 20-minute gameplay segment BioWare recently released (the above video), the player-character Rook and companions Lace Harding, Varric Tethras, and Neve Gallus stop Solas' attempt to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and Thedas. I won't spoil exactly what happens here, but Rook passes out moments later and wakes up in a dream-like landscape to the voice of Solas himself… because he's trapped here.</p>

<p>He explains he was attempting to move the Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain, both of whom are part of the Evanuris or Elven gods of ancient times, to a new prison because the old one was no longer containing them properly. Unfortunately for Solas, he's trapped here – the Fade – by our doing and Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain are free, blighted, and roaming Thedas. It's up to Rook to stop them, but it seems they'll have to work with Solas (or at least listen to his guidance and advice) to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So one of the principles we took to when we were building the story of The Veilguard early on was we wanted the beginning of the game to feel like the final chapter of an earlier story and you're coming in right at the end, you're coming in as if you've been chasing Solas – the [Solas at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC] who said he was going to end the world and tear down the Veil," Epler adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Epler says players will see early on (and as the narrative develops across Veilguard) that Solas sees much of himself in you, the player-controlled Rook, especially "the parts that maybe he doesn't like to face." As a result, there's an interesting push and pull between Solas and Rook. He says players can define the relationship between these two characters with their choices in dialogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can continue to be suspicious and hostile towards him, or you can start to see him and find that common ground, that connection between the two of you, and really develop a different relationship over the course of the story," Epler says.</p>

<p data-characters="143" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of the upcoming Season 4 Reloaded update, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>has a treat for Zombies fans available on both iOS and Android. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Activision confirmed that Zombie Royal is coming to <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em> on June 26, which coincides with the start of Season 4 Reloaded. Zombie Royal is a limited-time game that first appeared in the original <em>Warzone</em>, and then Raven Software remade the mode in the battle royale sequel. </p> <figure data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone 2’s</em> iteration of Zombie Royale supported a lobby of 72 players in trios. When a player gets killed, they turn into a zombie instead of getting sent to the gulag. Zombies are relatively weak but have charged jump, gas grenade, and fury abilities that help take down humans more easily. Human players dropped a syringe of Antivirals upon death; if a Zombie player retrieved two Antivirals, they would be sent back into the map as a human player again. However, if a zombie is killed, they must be redeployed by a human squadmate.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="false">Activision did not specify if the <em>Call of </em>Duty: Warzone Mobile Zombie Royal game mode or if there will be more changes and innovations. There will be a full blog post one week before the mid-season update goes live that will detail the upcoming game mode. If this Zombie Royal is anything like what we have previously seen, it will undoubtedly be one of the most popular game modes in the battle royale. Players universally praised both previous versions. </p>

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Pokémon Go</em> frequently hosts limited-time events, typically only lasting a day or even one hour. That’s why it’s crucial to keep track of the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-go-raid-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">event schedules</a>, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member. To stay updated, here’s the current <em>Pokémon Go</em> Community Day schedule for June 2024.</p>  <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The next Community Day for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-go-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a></em> launches on <strong>June 22, 2024, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time</strong>. The adorable Fire Mouse <strong>Cyndaquil</strong> takes center stage for this celebration, spawning more of this creature in the wilds. Shiny variants may also appear during this time, but unfortunately, they are not always guaranteed.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Niantic</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve captured a Cyndaquil, <strong>evolve it to Quilava</strong> to get a Typhlosion with a Blast Burn Charged Attack. However, you must do this during the event or two hours after its conclusion to gain this unique Pokémon.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">During the active hours of the Community Day in <em>Pokémon Go</em>, you’ll be reaping the rewards. Event bonuses include the opportunity to earn double XP and Stardust every time you capture a Pokémon. Lure Modules and Incense will be extended to a generous three hours, giving you ample time to make the most of the event. Plus, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/niantic-responds-to-recent-pokemon-go-backlash-its-hard-to-ignore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niantic</a> has a special surprise in store for those who take a few snapshots during Community Day.</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Cyndaquil’s Community Day also offers an exclusive Special Research story for one US dollar. But if you want to save some cash, this Pokémon will have its own Field Research tasks for even more challenges.</p> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="false">As for the rest of the schedule, Niantic has <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/cd-savethedate-s15/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed other Community Days</a> for the following months. Specifically, you can look forward to a Community Day on July 31 and August 31. The Pokémon for these events haven’t been mentioned yet, so we’ll be sure to update this guide once we have more information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/limited-run-games-is-localizing-assault-suit-leynos-2-saturn-tribute-this-year/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=limited-run-games-is-localizing-assault-suit-leynos-2-saturn-tribute-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Limited Run Games announced as part of <a href="https://youtu.be/0G3umAZ-nvM?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their LRG3 stream</a> that they will be localizing <em>Assault Suit Leynos 2</em> for the first time in North America. This looks like they’ll be publishing a translated version of <em>Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute</em>, which released in Japan earlier this year.</p> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true"><em>Assault Suit Leynos 2</em> is the third game in the <em>Assault Suit</em> series. In the West, we’d remember the first two games as <em>Target Earth</em> and <em>Cybernator</em>, but were actually <em>Assault Suit Leynos</em> and <em>Assault Suits Valken</em>, respectively. It’s part of a series of sci-fi mech games. I’ve talked about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/heres-a-closer-look-at-retro-bits-assault-suits-valken-re-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybernator/Assault Suits Valken</a></em> about a jillion times here on Destructoid. The series has seen something of a Western resurgence.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">While <em>Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute</em> is largely a port of the Sega Saturn version of the game, quality-of-life features have been added, such as saving, loading, a rewinding. There are also option difficulty adjustments.</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">More importantly, we never got <em>Leynos 2</em> in English. Our <em>Assault Suit</em> collection has been incomplete. This will bring us one step closer. Then the only thing missing is <em>Assault Suits Valken 2</em>, which is weirdly very similar to the <em>Front Mission </em>series. But then, <em>Front Mission: Gun Hazard</em> is extremely similar to <em>Assault Suits Valken</em> (because most of the staff is the same). So really, they were just returning the favor.</p>
 <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="58" data-injectable="false">But seriously, somebody translate and re-release <em>Valken 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false"><em>Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute</em> is out in North America sometime later in 2024. It’s coming to PS4, PS5, and Switch.</p>

<p data-characters="408" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Monopoly Games season just dropped today, and with it comes more albums than usual. Of all the seasons to release so far, Monopoly Games has the most number of albums, with 23 regular sets and five prestige variations. Fortunately, Scopely knows how daunting a task card-collecting is and has come out the gate revealing that four- and five-star sticker drop rates are higher this season.</p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">In the initial announcement posts for the Monopoly Games season from Scopely, we learn more about the differences between this season and previous ones. Alongside Monopoly Games being longer than previous seasons, lasting nearly 100 days, we have better chances of receiving four and five-star stickers. </p> <figure data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Monopoly GO Discord / Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">However, this doesn’t necessarily reveal whether the odds of getting unique cards are higher. This season may turn into three months of constant duplicate cards, which, fortunately, helps encourage sticker trading in the community. Unfortunately, this also means you could get excited to get a new card and complete one of your sets, only to find that your packs keep giving duplicates. The post also doesn’t specify whether gold card drops increased this season, and there are no guaranteed gold sticker packs this season, so this could introduce a whole lot more Golden Blitz trading.</p>
 <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">Nonetheless, this is a welcome change for anyone looking to complete all 23 base album sets during the Monopoly Games season, especially if you want to experience prestige for the first time. The final vault in Stickers for Rewards vaults is also a lower price than in previous seasons, dropping from 800 stars to 700. Like last season, though, there’s no wild sticker or guaranteed new card pack in the vaults, so you can still get duplicate stickers regardless of which you buy.</p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Monopoly Games season will run from June 20 until September 26, 2024, giving you over three months to get all 207 stickers for its sets.</p>

By leveraging AI, we create more&nbsp;engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning. Embracer Group also understands the potential risks associated with the use of AI.</p><p>Our aim is to empower our employees with AI applications.</p></blockquote></div><p>Developers have expressed concerns about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24042070/gdc-state-of-the-video-game-industry-survey-2023-ai">the use of AI in making games</a> and how AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23700619/ai-game-development-jobs-gdc-2023">might affect their jobs</a>. Those concerns might be particularly high regarding any AI initiatives from Embracer given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">the company’s recent layoffs</a>. But Tomas Hedman, Embracer’s head of privacy and AI governance, says the company doesn’t want to use AI in place of humans.</p><p>“We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” according to a statement from Hedman in the report. “This is the core of our human-centric&nbsp;approach to leveraging the potential with AI.” Hedman also argues that AI can “open up coding to a broader group of developers” by lowering the barrier to making games.</p><p>That said, Embracer believes it needs to adopt AI to stay competitive. In a heat map, Embracer identifies “non implementation of AI” as a potential “major” risk. “Not using AI for relevant tasks within Embracer Group will lead to us losing competitiveness and being outrun by our competitors,” the company says. Embracer also tracks AI governance as a potential risk, noting that the use of AI is “subject to general as well as specific laws and requirements.”</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181027/netflix-house-retail-dallas-king-of-prussia-2025"><h2>Netflix House will fill the voids left by dead department stores</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181870/openai-former-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-ssi-safe-superintelligence"><h2>OpenAI’s former chief scientist is starting a new AI company</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><h2>Zelda is finally getting her own game</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24181961/anthropic-claude-35-sonnet-model-ai-launch"><h2>Anthropic has a fast new AI model — and a clever new way to interact with chatbots</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180340/apple-pay-later-shutting-down-months-after-launch"><h2>Apple is shutting down Apple Pay Later just months after launch</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182599/elden-ring-patch-elden-beast-torrent<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wwqFyu">A new patch for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> was released Thursday, ostensibly to prepare the game for the arrival of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> DLC on June 21. But players of the base game are also getting a lovely treat, in the form of a major quality-of-life update to the base game’s final boss battle.</p>
<p id="yj9DIl">According to Bandai Namco’s <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">patch notes for version 1.12 of <em>Elden Ring</em></a>, developer FromSoftware has added a “new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.” <em>Elden Ring</em> players who have faced the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24173795/elden-beast-boss-fight-how-to-beat">Elden Beast</a> will know what a relief it is to have Torrent available in this situation, as the final boss battle involves a torturous amount of running from one side of the battle arena to the other, back and forth, and back and forth again, while chasing the always-moving monster.</p>
<p id="3oF2s1">While the Elden Beast battle was a majestic and challenging final confrontation, the incessant running around players had to do to get in a few swipes of a sword or get within spellcasting range was something of a nightmare. Especially since the Elden Beast is a two-parter; one needs to defeat another boss, Radagon, before facing the beast, and failure in the second part meant repeating the first.</p>

<p id="RK3Ku9">But the ability to summon Torrent in the Elden Beast boss fight isn’t the only major quality-of-life update for <em>Elden Ring</em> in patch 1.12. FromSoft has added a new “Recent Items” tab to players’ inventory screen, letting them easily find the latest thing (weapon, cookbook, talisman, etc.) they’ve picked up. Newly obtained items are marked with a “!” symbol, which will be hugely important for players acquiring a ton of new stuff with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. (Note that the Recent Items tab is an opt-in feature in the game’s settings menu, and having used it for the past week, I highly recommend turning it on!)</p>
<p id="s5CnLC"><em>Elden Ring</em> patch 1.12 does a whole lot more. There are new hairstyles, new PvP-exclusive balance adjustments, and a long list of weapon and skill tweaks, all of which are worth reviewing before diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> for the first time. </p>

You’re rewarded for playing aggressively, pushing the enemy, and not letting them catch a breath. To accomplish this feat, submachine guns reign supreme. They’re the ultimate close-quarters battle weapon, with a fast rate of fire, large magazine size, and high DPS. But you can’t carry every submachine gun with you, so choosing the right one could mean the difference between taking home the win or falling by the wayside in Low Town.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h27148"><a id=""></a>The Best SMG in <em>Warzone </em>Today</h2><p>The meta in <em>Warzone</em> changes frequently, but one SMG retains its top spot each season. That’s the <strong>Superi 46</strong>. It’s lightweight, easy to wield, and boasts a high rate of fire and low time to kill, making it ideal for the tight confines of Urzikstan or Rebirth Island.</p><p>Here are some key Superi 46 stats you might want to keep in mind for your next round:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Time to Kill</strong>: 616 ms</li><li><strong>ADS Speed</strong>: 204 ms</li><li><strong>Mobility</strong>: 5.0/s</li><li><strong>Max Range</strong>: 14.0m</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-recommend-id="image://eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pointing the Superi 46 at a naughty building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pointing the Superi 46 at a naughty building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-recommend-id="image://eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pointing the Superi 46 at a naughty building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h27149"><a id=""></a>Which perks and attachments to use for <em>Warzone</em>’s Superi 46</h2><p>If at all possible, while using the Superi 46, run the following perks:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Fast Hands</strong>: Reload, use equipment, and swap weapons faster.</li><li><strong>High Alert</strong>: Directional vision pulses when an enemy outside your view aims at you.</li><li><strong>Double Time</strong>: Doubles your Tactical Sprint duration and increases crouch movement speed by 30%.</li></ul><p>These perks emphasize the fast-paced gameplay necessary to excel with the Superi 46. Like any other submachine gun, even those outside the meta, the key to winning a fight with one is to fire fast and fire first. If you can surprise your opponent, they won’t have a chance to react appropriately, leaving you the opportunity to unload an entire magazine in their rears.<br></p><p>Lastly, you won’t always have the option of your preferred weapon attachments, but if you can score a loadout drop and you have a Superi 46 in your kit, here’s what you should run:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Zulu OP3 Light Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Zehmn35 Compensated Flash Hider</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Phantom Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Rescue-9 Stock</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: 40 Round Mag</li></ul><p>Whether you’re running the Superi 46 as a primary or secondary weapon, it excels in close-range encounters. It’s typically best to carry a long-range accompaniment, such as an assault or bolt-action sniper rifle, to hit targets from afar before moving in to finish the job.<br></p><h2 id="h27150"><a id=""></a>Honorable Mentions in the SMG Category</h2><figure id="" data-id="a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-recommend-id="image://a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-recommend-id="image://a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The SMGs in <em>Warzone</em> are highly effective, so most prove useful. But if you can’t get your hands on the Superi 46, then a few honorable mentions include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>MCW</strong></li><li><strong>Lachmann Shroud</strong></li><li><strong>WSP Swarm</strong></li></ul><p>The MCW is one of the most versatile and new-player-friendly weapons in the game, making it an ideal choice for not only the submachine gun category but all weapon types in <em>Warzone</em>.<br></p><p>The Lachmann Shroud comes equipped with a built-in suppressor, making it the go-to for crouch-and-stealth gameplay, while retaining a high fire rate and relatively low time to kill.<br></p><p>Lastly, we have the WSP Swarm. It’s not the top choice for competitive or diehard <em>Warzone</em> players, but the Swarm feels underrated. It’s swift, boasts a large magazine, and has one of the fastest rates of fire in the battle royale. You can make quick work of a small squad, should you land your shots.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>I didn't see much of Outlaws' story at Summer Game Fest, but what I saw of the gameplay did not leave a positive impression.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'm more shocked than anyone that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> didn't resonate with me. I love Star Wars, and have been hoping to get a new game in which we don't play as yet another Force-sensitive person. But after playing through three different sections of Outlaws at Summer Game Fest--each of which was about 15-20 minutes long--I walked away disappointed. Nothing about Outlaws feels bad; hell, bad would have been better than what I played, because then at least it could have been memorable in some way. Instead, Outlaws feels fairly mediocre and unmemorable. What I played feels like an amalgamation of different features and mechanics borrowed from other games that do those things better, all while masquerading as a Star Wars game without actually embodying the themes and storylines of Star Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Outlaws sees you play as Kay Vess, a smuggler striving to be a famed scoundrel by accomplishing heists throughout the Outer Rim. Though I didn't get to see these elements, Outlaws will feature instances where Kay can talk her way out of trouble and the game will feature a system akin to Grand Theft Auto's Wanted levels, in which Kay's actions have consequences that can chase her across the open worlds she'll be able to explore.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Outlaws Feels Like Respawn’s Jedi Games | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At SGF, I played in three contained, linear levels. The first saw Kay working her way through an Imperial facility before leaping into her ship and engaging in a dogfight against some TIE Fighters. The second part focused on the game's platforming mechanics, with Kay navigating a derelict ship. The third and final portion of the preview presented a level in which Kay was tasked with stealthily infiltrating an organization's base to steal back some stolen tech.</p><p dir="ltr">I have individual complaints with each of the sections but my main gripe with Star Wars Outlaws, based on this slice of the game, is that Kay feels way too powerful. It's possible Ubisoft put me on the easiest difficulty for the preview to make sure I'd get through each one in a timely manner, but if that's not the case then Outlaws is laughably easy. The ease of the third part of the preview feels the most damning. I wanted to see what would happen if I broke stealth, inciting the dozen nearby enemies in the immediate area to attack me all at once. I easily killed them all and subsequently completed the first part of my mission without having to sneak around. With this newfound confidence, I ran through the second half of the level, forgoing stealth entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">I eventually reached a locked door that I couldn't go through until all the enemies who had seen me were dead. I was far enough away that I couldn't quite see the enemies all the way back at the start of the area but my cursor occasionally changed from gray to red whenever the game registered that Kay was "aiming" at them, even if I could no longer see them. I just held the trigger whenever that happened and sniped the guards without even having to aim myself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322385"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kay's apparent invulnerability and god-like powers persisted throughout the demo, whether it was surviving three-story drops in the platforming sections or getting into a firefight and tanking multiple hits. Aside from simply feeling dull to play, this actively gets in the way of Kay's characterization as a scrappy scoundrel and smuggler. If anything, playing as Kay should feel more like how Han Solo accomplished problems in the original Star Wars trilogy--you take your shot when you can but you're far better off running away when the blaster bolts start flying. Even if Kay has no apparent Force powers (it's entirely possible we discover she does in the full game), Outlaws seems to be designed in a way to encourage you to play like she actually does--she can easily perform huge acrobatic leaps, make pinpoint shots without a sniper rifle, and take on hordes of enemies like they're nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Kay's strength also detracts from one of the core pillars of Outlaws, which is Kay's adorable partner-in-crime Nix. Nix can be commanded to aid Kay in a number of ways, such as distracting guards, fetching an out-of-reach weapon, or exploding a grenade in a person's pocket. Causing someone who's just minding their own business to suddenly explode is hilarious, but I never felt like I needed to use that command, or any of the others, in order to accomplish my goals. Kay is so versatile and able on her own, I never actually used Nix save for a few moments when the Ubisoft rep beside me told me how I could use Nix to solve the problem at hand and I did so to see how it would play out. I left the preview wondering why Nix is even a part of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322384" data-ratio="0.56206896551724" data-width="1160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322384"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My misgivings about Outlaws' lack of challenge aside, what I saw of the minute-to-minute gameplay also isn't all that remarkable. Kay handles a blaster just about as well as any other third-person shooter protagonist, and much like her peers in the action genre, she is regularly stymied by locked doors that can only be bypassed with annoying lockpicking minigames or finding an energy pylon to energize with an electrified shot. Again, none of what I played feels outright bad but it is very familiar and none of it stands out as notably good as a result--it doesn't help that a lot of what Outlaws does, Star Wars games that have come out in recent years have done much better. The shooting is fine but pales in comparison to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-463558">Battlefront II</a>, for example. The ship combat is unremarkable, especially on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-squadrons/" data-ref-id="5000-513910">Squadrons</a>. And the platforming challenges and puzzles feel like unimaginative speed bumps that don't take into account the same level of spectacle or narrative importance as those in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/" data-ref-id="5000-483335">Fallen Order</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-565322">Survivor</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I also didn't get a strong impression of Kay or any of the characters she met during the three sections I played. Perhaps Ubisoft is going for more of a blank slate for Kay to make her easier to connect to for more people, but even so, Star Wars lives and dies by its characters and it's difficult to feel excited for Outlaws when I played the game for nearly an hour and didn't really relate to anyone. It's an odd miss for Ubisoft, which usually develops games that are hit-or-miss for a lot of people but--at least for the story-driven ones--tend to have a handful of fairly memorable characters. Granted, Outlaws still could. But the sections I played through don't suggest that to be the case.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1067152076" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

reminded me of previewing 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saints-row/" data-ref-id="5000-536956">Saints Row</a>, a game that paints over half-baked systems and average storytelling with the trappings of a franchise I love. Outlaws so far feels exactly the same, using the imagery and sounds of Star Wars to disguise an otherwise mediocre game. Maybe the full release of Outlaws will surprise me in a way the full release of Saints Row didn't, but I have serious misgivings about Outlaws that I didn't have prior to playing it. The full game could be fantastic, but if so, this preview didn't sell me on it.</p><p dir="ltr">As one final addendum, what I played at Summer Game Fest did not look <em>anything</em> at all like what was shown off during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-forward-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6523848/" data-ref-id="1100-6523848">Ubisoft Forward</a>--that gameplay seems way more exciting and appropriate for a Star Wars game about a smuggler struggling to survive during the height of the Galactic Empire. That gameplay showcase dives into how Kay can use her scrappiness to learn new skills that will aid her in a pinch while still highlighting her shortcomings as an easily overwhelmed flesh-and-blood human who is better off fleeing from a dangerous situation than sticking around. If Outlaws plays more like what we saw at Ubisoft Forward and less like what I actually got to play at SGF, I think it will prove to be an entertaining Star Wars game. Only time will tell which experience we're going to get, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on August 30.</p>

<p data-characters="147" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Madden 25’s</em> new BOOM Tech system introduces physics-based tackling, improved ball carrier mechanics, and new catching and pre-play features. </p> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">In the first <em>Madden 25</em> <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/gridiron-notes-welcome-to-madden-25">blog</a>, EA provided a deep dive into BOOM Tech, which has been two years in the making. To start, BOOM Tech offers realistic control with every tackle, meaning players can punish ball carriers with devastating hit sticks or fly past offensive linemen with new truck, dive, and stiff arm animations. In addition, the new data-driven physics take into account timing, weight, speed, strength, and player ratings in one-on-one ball plays. The new hit stick makes it possible to tackle ball carriers harder than ever before based on the angle of impact, stick-skill, and accuracy of the cut sticks, big hits, and trucks. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">Players will feel the tackles as if they were on the field themselves thanks to the new sound effects and controller rumble hactics when a crunching tackle connects just right. Offense also gets an overhaul thanks to Boom Tech. A new ball carrier balance and recovery system makes it easier for running backs to counter the hit stick, break a tackle, and recover their balance before going down. </p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">As for when players can try out the new BOOM Tech system for the first time, <em>Madden 25</em> launches on August 16. </p>

 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Since the beginning albums are easy to complete, only requiring one and two-star stickers, they don’t provide much dice. However, the further you go, the more challenging the sets are to finish. Completing this rewards you with more dice, though, so it’s worth focusing on these when trading for new stickers or participating in events.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-stickers-in-nbsp-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">How to get stickers in&nbsp;Monopoly GO</h2> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">Getting new cards in <em>Monopoly GO</em> requires opening sticker packs, which you can get using numerous methods. You’ll open sticker packs to gain new cards, and their rarities determine the card types you get. A one-star pack will usually give you one and two-star stickers, with five-stars being guaranteed to provide you with one five-star card, among others of random qualities.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">Below are some ways you can get sticker packs in <em>Monopoly GO:</em></p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false"> <li>Participate in banner events and tournaments</li> <li>Complete reward tiers in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-monopoly-go-partner-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partners events</a>, Peg-E’s prize drop minigame, and Treasure hunt events</li> <li>Finish your daily Quick Win objectives</li> <li>Redeem a free shop gift every eight hours</li> <li>Trade with other players</li> <li>Complete showroom tiers</li> <li>Redeem <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-join-the-tycoon-club-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tycoon Club rewards</a></li> <li>Purchase sticker packs using real-world money</li> </ul> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="944" data-injectable="false">By far the easiest ways to get sticker packs are completing reward tiers in ongoing events and tournaments. While beginning reward milestones give you low-rarity sticker packs, finishing every tier usually gives you several four and five-star packs, depending on the event. Completing your daily quick win objectives also gives you a one-star sticker pack each day, with your weekly prizes giving you extra packs. Alongside these, you can also trade with other players to get stickers, redeem Tycoon Club rewards, or even use real money to buy packs if you wish. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/2024/6/20/24182415/elden-ring-cloth-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RRLtng">When you boot up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> for the first time, make sure you appreciate <em>Elden Ring’s</em> unsung hero: cloth.</p>
<p id="qfRRgP">FromSoftware has long been the master of dynamic cloth physics. That is, cloth that doesn’t follow a pre-set animation, but instead moves procedurally, based on an in-game physics engine.</p>
<p id="qnbM1D">It sounds simple, but it’s genuinely <em>really hard to do.</em></p>
<p id="sKjsgy">But FromSoftware has been doing it for years, and <em>Elden Ring</em> is just the latest and greatest manifestation of the studio’s cloth obsession. <em>Elden Ring</em>’s cloth isn’t just technically impressive, though. It communicates vital information about the world, and the characters that populate it.</p>
<p id="XvlPGi"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Take Mohg</a>, for example.</p>
<p id="91TlR1">He’s a messy boy who loves drama — and he’s dressed for it. The cape that he’s flung over his shoulders is a sumptuous red velvet, with a gold tassel fringe. </p>
<p id="PNhg35">“It’s very, quite literally in my opinion, theatrical,” visual artist Faith Schaffer pointed out in an interview. “It’s your classic red curtain with gold fringe.”</p>
<p id="FLIqAO">Mohg is the shunned child of the royal lineage, but instead of accepting a life in the sewers, he’s convinced himself he’s going to create his own dynasty. That plan somehow involves dressing like an absolute pimp and kidnapping his stepbrother. But really, he has one of the most baroque outfits in the game, which reads as extreme compensation for the royal treatment he was denied. He is putting on a show.</p>
<p id="PEEz6y">And FromSoftware always goes the extra mile when it creates dynamic cloth. The Godskin Duo are, yeah, wearing flesh. It looks disgusting, clammy, and blobby. It would be gross under any circumstances. But this flesh-cloth has its own physics parameters that cause it to flop and wobble. </p>
<p id="DN21kS">It’s a great example of how good FromSoftware is at using uniquely tuned physics to create distinct <em>movement</em>. If they had copied and pasted the same physics parameters they used for a velvet shawl or cotton cloak, it would still be distressing. But they went the extra mile and tuned the dangly bits of the robe to move with a distinct, cartilaginous wobble. </p>
<p id="WjpjJF">To learn more about how FromSoftware’s cloth contributes to the incredible worldbuilding of Elden Ring, <a href="https://youtu.be/wSSqx-Dh6ko">check out the video above</a>!

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While exploring the Tiderise Cliff area in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>, the Rover can get an extra amount of 20 Astrite by taking part in the Kitten’s Luck Lucky Draw. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">But although the system behind the draw is simple —you pay the 5x fish fee, pick a chest, and then open it for a chance of getting the prize— finding the latter can prove to be a little tricky. So that you can find it on your first try, here’s in which chest the Ultimate Prize is located on <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-ultimate-prize-chest-location-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Ultimate Prize Chest location in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">You can find the Ultimate Prize in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> by opening the Basic Supply Chest located by the stairs leading to the Lucky Draw area. The chest will be located by a wooden lamplight and be placed almost parallel to a Standard Supply Chest.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Upon opening the chest, the Treasure Store’s Hostess will show her surprise and close off her shop. Apart from the already mentioned 20 Astrite, you will also receive the following as part of the Ultimate Prize:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Three Wood Textured Shards</li> <li>6.000 Shell Credits</li> <li>30 Union EXP</li> <li>One to three Basic Energy Cores</li> <li>A random number of Basic, Medium, and Advanced Sealed Tubes </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-how-to-get-fish-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to get fish in Wuthering Waves</h3> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">The main way to get fish in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> can be done by catching them. You can do that by heading to any body of water and then either swimming or walking to them before pressing the gathering key/button. Although the fish in the game are pretty passive and will usually only move after you reach them, you can attack them beforehand to make the process easier. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">I was able to find a large quantity of fish in the waters surrounding the Kitten’s Luck. You can also find a consistent amount of it on the shallow pool housing the Bell-Borne Geochelone boss. Interestingly enough, Tetra is the only type of fish currently available in <em>WuWa</em>. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">If you are not in the mood to do the above, you can buy Fish from Mahe’s Grocery in Jinzhou. Each unit will cost 1.500 Shell Credits and you can purchase a maximum of 10 during each world rotation. Apart from its use on the draw, fish can also be used to make various recipes, such as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-milky-fish-soup-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milky Fish Soup</a>.</p>
