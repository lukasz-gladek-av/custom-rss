With stints working at big-name studios like Valve and Arkane, Antonov’s work was a key part of some of the most loved games of all time. It was his unmistakable style that defined <em>Half-Life 2</em>'s City 17 and <em>Dishonored</em>’s Dunwall, two of the most distinctive and unforgettable locations in game history. We spoke to people who knew and loved him to learn more about Antonov and his work.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Beginning on memorable games like 1997's <em>Redneck Rampage</em> and 1999's infamous <em>Kingpin: Life of Crime</em>, Viktor Antonov had quickly formed a partnership with fellow game artist Aaron Barber. Barber was hired by Valve, working on 2001's original <em>Half-Life</em>, and Viktor soon followed. <strong>Marc Laidlaw</strong>, the legendary writer behind the <em>Half-Life</em> franchise, told me that once both had been hired and <em>Half-Life 2 </em>development had begun, the two “started in right away.”</p><p>Laidlaw had a vision for City 17, but found it hard to properly articulate. Thankfully, Antonov was there. “Viktor was very thorough in trying to understand what we were after, and once he saw the situation, he set about correcting it,” says Laidlaw. “The game was in need of correctives, and strong visual unity, and Viktor provided that, going between the daily practical ‘Yes but how do I actually build it?’ needs of level designers and my vague, atmospheric, ‘It should sorta feel like’ suggestions.”</p><figure id="" data-id="175956a1b2f23e54dd3b40c2ca817945" data-recommend-id="image://175956a1b2f23e54dd3b40c2ca817945" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strider stalks the player in City 17." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A strider stalks the player in City 17." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="175956a1b2f23e54dd3b40c2ca817945" data-recommend-id="image://175956a1b2f23e54dd3b40c2ca817945" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strider stalks the player in City 17." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“I was really smitten with [the stop-motion animation duo] the Brothers Quay,” Laidlaw told <em>Kotaku</em>, “so in my mind we were chasing a shadowy surreal kind of European style, but meanwhile I grew up in Southern California and have never been to Europe, so it could only ever be stylized and abstract, and hard to communicate in terms of spaces designed for combat.” But Viktor, born in Bulgaria, then living in France, Switzerland, Los Angeles and eventually Seattle, had a novel perspective, and more than simply for geography. Laidlaw continued, “Viktor bridged those worlds—between literary abstraction and concrete level design, between general themes and specific architecture.”</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We would talk and then he would go off and talk to the artists and designers and slowly a world we could all agree on emerged, full of promise, full of specificity, realistic in some senses but also unique to our game.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Laura Dubuk</strong> was a young art student, and working at Valve was her first professional job. Viktor Antonov would be her mentor at the studio, leaving an indelible mark on her career. “For me personally,” Dubuk told me, “he got across how much work and skill it would take to succeed in the video game industry, and how to do it properly. Thankfully he gave me clear direction and led me to learn the fundamentals so I could begin my journey.”</p><p>Dubuk continued, “Viktor was a truly unique, unforgettable person. He cared deeply about his friends, and wanted to make sure they were all cared for properly, and going about their lives well and with intention. He was an incredibly observant person which gave him an amazing sense of humor, and was an extremely engaging conversationalist. He was intensely curious and went to the absolute depth of every topic that captured his attention. It goes without saying this curiosity and passion was infectious.”</p><hr><p>After many years with Valve, Viktor Antonov moved to Arkane Studios, the developer behind <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Prey</em>, and it was the former where Antonov had the most distinct influence. Marc Laidlaw noted the impact of his move. “I think you can see that when Viktor went off and designed worlds with Arkane, the similarities between <em>Half-Life 2</em> and <em>Dishonored</em> show that there was a distinctive Viktor Antonov style that kind of transcended both games and belonged to his original sensibility.”</p><p><strong>Raphaël Colantonio</strong>, the founder and former president of Arkane Studios, shared the sentiment. “He and Arkane bonded over the shared passion for creating worlds,” Colantonio told me, “free from corporate and commercial influences: we were both idealists, we wanted to do pure art. That sincerity and uncompromised mindset was deeply ingrained in Arkane in general.”</p><p>“Viktor was one of those people that you instantly know are one in a billion,” Colantonio said. “I could talk about him for hours. We were extremely lucky to cross paths with him on his way out from Valve.”</p><figure id="" data-id="622cba1237bea65bb85d66f8adcaf29a" data-recommend-id="image://622cba1237bea65bb85d66f8adcaf29a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1981" data-height="1114" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The grim vision of Dunwall in Dishonored, seen from a boat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The grim vision of Dunwall in Dishonored, seen from a boat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arkane / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="622cba1237bea65bb85d66f8adcaf29a" data-recommend-id="image://622cba1237bea65bb85d66f8adcaf29a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1981" data-height="1114" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The grim vision of Dunwall in Dishonored, seen from a boat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Colantonio recalls how Antonov played such a crucial role in designing the look and feel of the game’s central city, Dunwall. “Viktor leveled up Arkane’s art department. He worked closely with [art director] Sébastien Mitton to restructure and change our processes and together they built a world-class team of artists that could rival any top team in the world.”</p><p><strong>Harvey Smith</strong>, who headed up Arkane Austin, added his memories of Viktor. “An absolute titan like Viktor Antonov working with the already-stacked Arkane art team, led by the incredibly talented Sebastian Mitton and Jean-Luc Monnet, was one of those thunderbolt moments that keeps reverberating forever, across the lives of all the people who worked on or played the <em>Dishonored</em> games. I will always be moved and humbled by what that visual design group created.”</p><p>That sense of  impact was also brought up by Marc Laidlaw, who sees Antonov’s influence in similarly game-changing ways. “Viktor at that point in time not only benefited the games he worked on, but the industry as a whole,” said Laidlaw, “helping it step away from the wearisome influences of <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> and <em>Alien</em>. I think we agreed that the visual vocabulary of the game industry needed to be drastically expanded, especially when it came to science fiction and fantasy. So if future games end up looking a bit like City 17 or Dunwall instead of Giger or Syd Mead, we will have Viktor to thank.”</p><hr><p>Beyond Viktor Antonov’s influence on games and game design, he was also a man people simply loved. Everyone I spoke to was effusive with praise for his decency, passion and warmth.</p><p>“Viktor was a force of nature,” said Harvey Smith. “Simultaneously the storm and the rock you cling to. He educated those around him about art, design, and beauty with every breath, even when talking about brutal systems of oppression, like the security systems in <em>Dishonored</em>; perpetually relevant subject matter, it seems. His insights, his powerful presence, and his devastating dry wit will be missed.”</p><p>“Viktor was extremely intelligent, articulate, always surprising with shocking yet accurate remarks about world building,” Raphaël Colantonio recalled. “People respected him and were often intimidated because of his serious demeanor (though he was secretly extremely funny). We became good friends, we traveled together a lot. No-one could tie up or control Viktor, but when I left Arkane to start Wolfeye Studios, he consulted for our projects, like in the good old times. I miss him, I miss his funny wit.”</p><p>Lovely guy,” said former Valve developer <strong>Chet Faliszek</strong>, “and being super Frenchy, he was a fun breath of fresh air at Valve.”</p><p>“Losing Viktor is a big loss because I know he still had a lot to offer,” Dubuk said, “but again he contributed so much in his life to games and film during his years, and I know we are all grateful for him.”</p><p>Marc Laidlaw recalled their shared love of literature, how “a recurrent conversation of ours concerned Nikolai Gogol.” He explained, “Viktor urged me repeatedly to read The Nose and The Overcoat, two of his favorite stories. I can no longer remember his point—probably he was just trying to expand my own vocabulary for literary surrealism. After retirement, I finally got a complete Gogol collection and read through it, with special attention to Viktor’s favorites.”</p><p>“One last memory,” added Marc Laidlaw. “My youngest daughter was obsessed with Paris after watching the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie, <em>Passport to Paris</em>. On one of his trips to France, Viktor returned with a souvenir model of the Eiffel Tour just for her.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Last year, Activision confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>'s original Verdansk map would return to the free-to-play battle royale in 2025, but the publisher still hasn't provided further details for the map's release. Now, new leaks have surfaced to suggest a more "OG" version of Verdansk, detailing some of the map's main points of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">According to known Call of Duty insider "<a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" rel="nofollow ">The Ghost of Hope</a>," Verdansk will return with the launch of Season 3. The leaks also suggest that the map will be very similar to the original version that launched back in March of 2020, but the insider does detail a few minor differences.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">EXCLUSIVE Details on the return of Verdansk:<br>- Will launch with Season 3 of BO6<br>- It is pretty much the OG March 2020 version<br>- Train Station interior will be closed<br>- Interior of Stadium will be open BUT roof will be closed<br>- The Train returns<br>- No fast travel subway system <a href="https://t.co/69aAy79RLS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/69aAy79RLS</a></p>  — Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">One of the most notable details mentioned is that Verdansk will keep the Stadium point of interest with the roof intact. This might be a controversial map decision for Verdansk's return, as the original Stadium could often be a frustrating location to traverse. The building was usually plagued with rooftop campers, and it was also a massive structure to try and maneuver around while running from the gas.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Ghost of Hope does suggest that the interior of Stadium will be open this time, so hopefully players can use interior passages to better escape the area during a circle collapse. It's also worth noting that a post-launch update for Modern Warfare and Warzone included a Verdansk event that blew the top off Stadium to make the point of interest more viable. So, it's possible further map changes could arrive sometime after the return of Verdansk.</p><p dir="ltr">The insider claims that the train is returning with Verdansk, which was a feature that was not part of the original map design. The Train Station point of interest is also mentioned to be included on the map, but the station's interior will be closed off. A fast-travel subway system was added to Verdansk in a later season, but Ghost of Hope says this isn't planned for the map's return.</p><p dir="ltr">While all leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, it's worth mentioning that known Call of Duty dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1892643037462835327" rel="nofollow ">RealityUK</a> also claims that Verdansk references are now showing in the game files following the Season 2 Reloaded update.</p><p dir="ltr">If true, players won't have long to wait before the fan-favorite Verdansk returns. Based on the days left in the Season 2 battle pass, the Season 3 update should arrive to Black Ops 6 and Warzone around March 20. Until then, players can expect a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-adds-tmnt-event-plus-splinter-included-in-paid-pass/2900-6270/#3" data-ref-id="2900-6270">TMNT-themed limited-time event</a> on February 27, and the Clover Craze event arrives on March 13 for early Saint Patrick's Day celebrations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mecha BREAK developer Amazing Seasun Games recently invited Wccftech and a handful of other gaming outlets to their main offices in California to go hands-on with the latest PC build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a>. In this session, we were able to sample a taste of the three core modes.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t kept up with the media blitz of reveal trailers and mode announcements, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-demo-first-time-in-actual-game-ai-powered-interactions-mecha-break/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a> is, at its core, a hero shooter with gigantic mechs. Players assume control of one of 13 mechs available across a variety of roles, including your typical short-range bruisers, long-range snipers, and healing/support mechs. Each mech comes with a radically different kit in terms of weapons and active/passive abilities that all run on their own timers that should feel instantly familiar to anyone that might have dabbled in Marvel Rivals or Overwatch over the past few years. What sets Mecha BREAK apart from the other hero shooters on the market is a fast-paced dash and evade gameplay that evokes strong feelings of taking your favorite Mobile Suit and giving them the mobility kit of Jehuty from Zone of the Enders. Sure, you could play Mecha Break as a slow and deliberate tank class if that’s more your style, or you could take the role of Vic Viper and play the Falcon and transform between mech and fighter plane at will.</p>
<p>The game's core mode focuses on the 6-vs-6 team gameplay across a variety of familiar match types, each with Amazing Seasun Games’ take on the formula. You have your standard team deathmatch modes and Headquarters-style capture and hold base defense as well as a transport mode that can only be described as pushing the payload. Depending on the mechs that you’ve unlocked/purchased, your mileage may vary depending on your performance in each mode. If Tricera is one of your first mechs unlocked, this walking fortress might be the perfect addition to guard the payload to its final destination.</p>
<p>My playstyle in most hero shooters leans towards playing more of the support/healing role, and I first tried Lumine and their twin pistol combat kit meant that I could either deal damage or swap to a healing mode to support my teammates, making this mech feel like a direct analog to Overwatch’s Moira. However, it wasn’t until I picked up the heavy sniper Aquila that I got a proper feel for how damage and harassment are meant to work in Mecha BREAK. Giving a sniper the ability to automatically lock on up to six enemies at a time and unload your entire sniper clip at once was too good to pass up, even if the damage inflicted was usually minimal, depending on how shielded the enemies were.</p>
<p>The different types of shielding and health are something I haven’t quite fully grasped in Mecha BREAK, despite how simple they are on the surface. Each mech comes with a passive shield called Fluid Armor that’s meant to sustain most types of damage; once it’s been drained or overloaded, then any damage taken is converted to direct HP damage. On top of that, each mech has its own variety of defensive stats to protect against energy, melee, ballistic and blast weapon types. For Aquila, all of that mech’s damage is done via energy weapons. I found out quite early on that, despite that massive sniper rifle Aquila carries, it doesn’t really do enough damage to be the AWP-wielder I wanted it to be. Instead, he’s more of a poke/harass type, meant to chip away at enemies from afar while the more melee or close-ranged focused attackers go in for the kill.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Evacuate-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>The real star of the show that Amazing Seasun Games invited us out to play was their new extraction mode, Mashmak. This loot-and-scoot PvPvE mode is all about airdropping onto a massive 16x16 km map, scouting for resources, taking out rival squads and NPC bosses, and making it out alive with whatever you can carry with you. Despite having a large map, the actual gameplay is limited to up to ten squads of three players, with empty spots filled by NPCs. To force players to keep moving and not camp out in one remote corner of the map, extraction points slowly start to appear at the ten-minute mark with more dropping every five minutes; once one has been used, it’s gone for good for the rest of that match. Not only do players have to contend with enemy players potentially camping these extraction points out, but there’s a constantly shrinking field of engagement as Corite Pulse Storms slowly engulf the battlefield. This field can disable weapon lock-ons and also inflict a constant drain on both mech health and fluid armor.</p>
<p>While players are limited to bringing one of their unlocked mechs to battle, that doesn’t mean it’s the only tool available to them. Players can call in a variety of airdrops, from rocket beacons to extract some of your earned loot, repair beacons to heal up the entire squad, and a survival beacon that each player comes automatically equipped with that can call a downed squad member back to the fight on a five-minute cooldown.</p>
<p>There’s another beacon that became my favorite part of Mashmak: the weapon airdrop. Players can select a completely different secondary weapon to bring to the fight and call at will. Playing a sniper that has some serious close-range deficiencies? Equip a lance and unleash your inner Panther. Unlike the main multiplayer modes where weapons are all recharge-based, both main and subweapons in Mashmak all run off of ammo that will need to be collected from enemy drops or loot crates.</p>
<p>In its current state, Mashmak’s NPCs are brain-dead if you can engage them from afar like Aquila. Because of this, I spent a good majority of my matches clearing out enemy fodder units from afar so that my teammates could rush in without fear of being shot by turrets. When it came time to face an actual player squad, Aquila felt underwhelming and my main source of damage came from a twin pair of rocket launchers that I picked up from one of those weapon airdrops. I could go either way with the current state of NPCs in Mecha BREAK’s Mashmak. It’s fun for a short while that Mashmak is largely a shooting gallery for enemies that don’t have much bite, but at the same time, there is rarely a sense of danger from rushing headfirst into a base due to the game's mobility and fluid armor mechanics, at least until you come across a rival squad or one of Mashmak’s gigantic bosses.</p>

<p>A successful extraction in Mashmak usually rewarded me with new research unlocks for different gear that I could bring into the next match or call in via airdrop, including high-mobility gliders that can give some of your slower attackers like Stego an unfair advantage when it comes to chasing down and harassing enemy squads.</p>
<p><a href="https://mechabreak.seasungames.com/">Mecha BREAK</a> is currently on track for a Spring 2025 release on PC (Steam and Xbox App) along with an exclusive console launch on Xbox Series S|X. PlayStation 5 has also been confirmed for a release later in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apocalyptic-deckbuilder-as-we-descend-gets-march-early-access-release-date.1117515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Box Dragon and publisher Coffee Stain have announced the release date for apocalyptic roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, which is launching into Early Access next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>will land on PC via Steam Early Access on March 27th, and since we're at the start of the latest Steam Next Fest event right now, you can try the game out for free on that same platform if you like.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, you'll be thrust "into an apocalyptic future to shape the fate of a submerging civilization at the end of the world". It'll be your job to oversee "a city on the edge of extinction" while also sending expeditions beyond the city's walls to see what lies in wait for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date-cards.jpg?itok=ZgghQKEo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date-cards.jpg?itok=27euRW1z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>brings apocalyptic roguelike deckbuilding to Steam Early Access in March.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be gathering resources to keep your city alive, all while navigating "feudal politics" and building relationships with those around you in order to compel them to your cause.</p>

<p>Beyond the city management aspect of&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it'll also offer "challenging card-based combat" for which you can recruit "a variety of squads with unique card sets and abilities", allowing for a number of different combinations and strategies.</p>

<p>Combat revolves around two different zones: the Guard Zone and the Support Zone. Switching your forces between both zones will allow you to dodge monster attacks and set up your defenses.</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect from a roguelike, death won't be the end in&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, either. As the Steam page notes, failure will arm you with "new secrets", allowing you to "begin the next journey with new knowledge and tools".</p>

<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 27th. The demo is live right now, and you can check it out until March 3rd, so make sure to give it a look if you're a fan of card battlers like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">Slay the Spire</a>&nbsp;</em>or city-builders like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/frostpunk" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostpunk</em></a>.</p>

I hope this change will allow developers to create without being unfairly punished.”</p><p>“Playstack is pleased to confirm the PEGI Complaints Board’s decision to reclassify Balatro to a PEGI 12 rating, following appeals from Playstack and our physical distributor, Fireshine Games,” Playstack communications director Wout van Halderen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We applaud the PEGI Experts Group on their commitment to develop a more granular set of classification criteria as indie games continue to stretch into new ideas and concepts. We believe it is a sign of a healthy classification board that it evolves in line with cultural expectations and continue to ensure that audiences understand the type of content present in games.”</p><p>“I’m happy that PEGI finally made the right call here and lowered <em>Luck be a Landlord’s</em> age rating,” says Dan DiIorio, the solo game developer at TrampolineTales, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trampolinetales.com/post/3liww64yvhc2a">in a post on Bluesky</a>. “I just hope that this sets a standard and other games are treated the same way <em>Balatro</em> and <em>Luck be a Landlord</em> were. Now give games with loot boxes (actual gambling) higher age ratings!”</p><p><em><strong>Update, February 24th</strong>: Added statements from LocalThunk, TrampolineTales’ Dan DiIorio, and a revised statement from Playstack.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I adore the premise of DoubleWe: you’re given a randomised appearance, dumped in a cramped sci-fi shithole full of dodgy-looking NPCs, and forced to find kill your identical clone before he can emerge from the crowd and shank you first. There’s a demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>, and it’s provoked in me some of the most pulse-quickening paranoia since the days of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>ID’ing the clone is, despite the ruffian density, usually the easy part. You have a mirror on you at all times, and the Evil You typically prefers to bide their time and blend in instead of rushing straight for the kill, so you have a few moments to memorise your doppelganger. Still, that window is better spent scrounging up a flimsy knife or one-shot pistol from weapon stashes. Rather than wrapping you in a comfort blanket of justifiable self-defence violence, however, arming yourself only serves to up the tension further.</p>
<p>Opening the stashes is agonisingly slow – my very first death came when the clone took advantage of my apparent difficulties with operating a briefcase – and the weapons themselves force you into close-range, all-or-nothing confrontations with an opponent who’s far less likely to miss their swing. Add in the general unease of how readily the clustered NPCs will stop to stare at you, plus the knowledge that DoubleWe’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> structure means failure will send you back to the start of a chapter, and each round becomes a deliciously mistrustful slice of shortform suspense. Even taking the time to stalk your own stalker at the beginning doesn’t help much, as stopping to grab a weapon is more than enough time for them to melt back into the throng, or to lurk behind the corners of a chokepoint. I ain’t walking though that doorway, man. The other me might be in there.</p>

</figure>
<p>That’s just the earliest encounters, too. After a few successful slayings, any hopes of settling down into more relaxed clone deathmatches are dashed by devious raisings of the stakes. First, officers are introduced to baton you senseless if they see you gearing up an attack, forcing you to either strike more swiftly or coax your pursuer into a quieter corner. Then, an anonymous assassin is dispatched to actively hunt you from the start, laying on even more pressure (and, if you decide to fight back, depleting your weapon uses) while forcing you to scan every single one of these blockheaded creeps for a telltale blade. I remain both intrigued and perturbed by the more overtly horror-flavoured antagonist variants that the final game will feature, including clones that explode into raging, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4</a>-style meat yuccas, though such monstrosities would be in keeping with DoubleWe’s taste for escalating threats.</p>
<p>I only rarely enjoy being scared in games, but I do crave a more sustained, eerie flavour of tension – it’s what made creeping through Chernogorsk, praying its snipers were watching elsewhere, such an electric thrill. DoubleWe manages to recreate and intensify that feeling in compact, minute-and-a-half bursts, and I’d dearly like to string myself out on more of them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/">The demo</a> for Kaizen's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/promise-mascot-agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a> throws a lot of ideas you, but at its heart, it's just a game about being a good boss.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Stripped back, it's part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> driving game, part business management. You pull up in the cursed town of Kaso-Machi, a broke yakuza with a sentient severed digit hanging out in the back of your grimy pickup truck.</p>
<p>You're here to make scratch helping the locals, so you'll need to recruit mascot creatures to hire out for jobs. They're a hopeless bunch, possessing all the neurotic animism you'd expect from distinctly 21st century yōkai. You're soon negotiating salaries and benefits with a giant block of perpetually weeping tofu. Then, enlisting the help of a traffic safety superhero to help out when jobs go south.</p>
<p>The tofu gets stuck in a door on their first job. To help out on the next, I pack them a lunch comprising a wilted hamburger from a vending machine. The tutorial missions dry up, so I open the map. It takes a moment to realise what I'm looking at. Or, rather, what I'm not.</p>

<p>Not a nagging map marker in sight, despite a menu telling me there are several tasks available. Promise Mascot Agency will only mark the activities available on your map if you explicity tell it to. You ask Pinky for hint, and choose the type of activity you fancy, whether that's recruiting new mascots, finding new jobs, or hiring more heroes. Once you ask - and only then - the game adds a pin showing where to find that type of task.</p>
<p>This is - if I'm using my academic ludology terms correctly - the good shit. An adrenaline shot for decision paralysis. A Marie Kondolance for our era's inescapable hellscape of cluttered landscapes. I have stared deep into the skittish eyes of the chattering mind monkey and sealed his lips together with Gorilla Glue, but not before <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/1dlwkv3/til_heightmogging/">heightmogging</a> him with the gorilla on the label. Thank you, Promise Mascot Agency.</p>
<p>There's plenty more to love here. The town is run down and dusky, but the landscape flows in such a way that you can see the streetlights shoal together from a distance. Driving in from the outskirts feels like it does when you catch a taxi in from an airport; the rising swell of life and lights and noise despite a ghostly ambience. Dreamy, dark pop slows to a warped cassette crawl when you pause. I collect floating coins that each tell tiny stories with their confirmation pop ups. A wallet containing a shopping list with nothing crossed off. A thousand yen note used a bookmark. When I crash the car my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-use-a-ps5-dualsense-controller-on-pc">DualSense</a> speaker starts yelling a cartoonish, clattering racket at me.</p>

<p>A pack of ghostly foxes escape from a mechanic's garage while I'm chatting to him. I chase them for truck upgrades. The first gives me a cannon that lets me shoot Pinky at the remaining foxes. You can't leave your truck, which is tiny bit awkward in certain spots, but you can bunny hop and boost over difficult terrain. Your truck is invulnerable and I wholly believe the game wants you to drive like an idiot.</p>
<p>I think the tofu crying all the time is a reference to how irritating it is to drain tofu so you can grill it properly, although its mainly used here to humiliate the poor creature. Alongside the exploration, social, and management aspects, the other part of Promise Mascot Agency is card battles that take place when your mascots run into trouble on their jobs. They look like this:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/promise-mascot-agency-door-battle.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kaizen Game Works/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The demo is unfortunately timed, and I didn't get much of a chance to see how much depth the card game has, but the basic idea is that you use the cards of the heroes you've recruited to damage whatever obstacle you're up against like a boss battle. Run out of actions before you win, and you lose. It's perhaps the game's weakest aspect but again, I barely scratched the surface. Still, what's here is just as beautifully odd and oddly beautiful as you'd expect from Kaizen. It's due out this year, and I will make that tofu smile if it kills me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 12 episodes will be released in batches of three per week, breaking the final season into four chapters covering events spread across five years.</p><p> The show’s conclusion will lead directly into the events of <em>Star Wars: Rogue One</em> and the original trilogy, meaning prepare for some gnarly time jumps. But all you really need to know about the show is that it somehow both felt like prestige TV and authentically <em>Star Wars</em>. Here’s the new trailer:</p><p>“We’re in a war,” Cassian says at the beginning. “You want to fight? Or you wanna win?” The ominous advice suggests season 2 will ramp up the “ends justify the means” tension that took shape in season 1 as Cassian and company expand the scope of their insurrection against the empire to new fronts, from backroad trade routes to going undercover in the halls of political power. </p><p> “One of the great thrills of making <em>Andor </em>is the scale of the story and the number of characters we’re able to meet—ordinary people, Imperial overlords, passionate revolutionaries,” creator and showrunner&nbsp;Tony Gilroy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/andor-season-2-teaser-trailer/#:~:text=The%20final%20season%20will%20unfold,subsequent%20chapters%20debuting%20each%20week.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/andor-season-2-teaser-trailer/#:~:text=The%20final%20season%20will%20unfold,subsequent%20chapters%20debuting%20each%20week." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in an announcement today</a></span>. “They are real people making epic decisions, all of them staring down questions with terrifying consequences. Cassian’s journey is the soul and spine of our story, but it’s the choir that makes the show. I’m so excited for audiences to see where we go in Season 2.” </p><p>We also catch a harried Forest Whitaker returning as the battle-hardened Saw Gerrera trying to inspire new recruits, as well as Ben Mendelsohn showing up as weapons research director Orson Krennic, who’s overseeing the construction of the Death Star. Plus there’s a good number of things going “kaboom” and “pew-pew” across various elaborate and realistic-looking settings. It all looks quite expensive! Hopefully Gilroy and the rest of the creative and production teams can bring <em>Andor</em> in for the landing it deserves. And then we can all be sad that nothing <em>that</em> good might be made again in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe for quite some time...or ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mecha BREAK, a mecha-based third-person shooter from Amazing Seasun Games, is quickly picking up momentum during its Steam open beta. The game that features both 6v6 objective-based multiplayer matches and a PvPvE mode that combines extraction shooter with battle royale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-beta-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 317,000 concurrent players during its first day</a>.</p>



<p>Just days before the start of the open beta, Insider Gaming was invited alongside other media to the developer’s North American office in Irvine, California. During the event, we got to try out the game’s tutorial, its 6v6 mode, and couple matches of the PvPvE mode, Mashmak.</p>



<p>We also got the chance to sit down with the company’s CEO and Mecha BREAK’s creator, Kris Kwok, to talk about the game’s audience, his unique approach to player feedback, and new content fans can expect over the next couple months. During the interview and during Kris’s earlier presentations, one thing became very clear: this is the game he’s always wanted to make.</p>



<h2 id="h-mecha-break-creator-kris-kwok-says-all-the-mecha-s-are-his-children">Mecha BREAK Creator Kris Kwok Says All The Mecha’s Are His “Children”</h2>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: You said you’ve always wanted to make a mecha game. What challenges have arisen in trying to make a game that appeals to both mecha fans and the more general gaming audience?</strong></p>



<p>There’s two sides: I have an emotional drive to make this game, and a [more] rational side. At the very beginning, rationally speaking, we weren’t that confident about reaching out to non-mecha fans. Earlier on [around 2021], we were only aiming at the 6v6 mode, but what surprised us and gave us a confidence boost was that in China, which isn’t known as the capital of mecha fans, we still got about a million views within three days on one platform. The reason we’re so confident in the project is that the more we do, the more positive feedback we get.</p>



<p>On the emotional side of things, no matter how good the FPS you make [is], the main vehicle of expression is the person. You’re shooting as a human. So a lot of games, despite other features, kind of feel repetitive. So in this project, what we’re seeking is a novel experience: operating as a mecha to gain that differential from traditional shooter games.</p>



<p>We’re not aiming at a wider audience [by including an extraction shooter]. We would like to bring the experience of operating a mecha to people who like mecha and who like extraction shooters. We’re still serving the core audience of mecha fans first. So we’re doing what we’re good at, which is making the mecha gameplay good. If both [mecha and non-mecha] fans really like it, they’ll naturally introduce it to other people via word-of-mouth.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Mecha BREAK has undergone years of various testing periods. What piece of player feedback from those tests most heavily influenced the current state of the game?</strong></p>



<p>Technically speaking, if the world is behind in the sense that everybody’s running [with] a horse carriage, then they wouldn’t advise you to invent a car yet. They don’t know what they want. So, despite what [players] say, I’d much rather spend time watching <em>how </em>they play. I spent a lot of time watching players’ livestreams and replays. I’m almost addicted to people playing the games I’ve created. A lot of problems were discovered just by watching those replays. In general, players are adequate in providing bug feedback and accessibility feedback, [but] in terms of big visionary direction, they’re just not equipped.</p>



<p>At the beginning we only had 3v3 and 6v6, and could have gone into official launch last year. During a trip to Japan, I realized in the 3v3 and 6v6 matches that players tend not to communicate with each other. And every time they died they got really frustrated. That opens a space that the Japanese players really wanted: a PvE area where they can either solo it or play with a couple friends casually. That’s how we arrived at the decision to make Mashmak. Originally it was teams of six broken down into sub-squads of two or three, but they would get lost in the map very quickly. And with a team of six it’s even harder to coordinate. That’s why I emphasize observation over verbal feedback.</p>



<p><strong>IG: When you first play the tutorial, it almost feels like it’s setting up the story for a single player campaign? Was that something you ever considered for Mecha BREAK?</strong></p>



<div><p>“We don’t have any official plan to implement a campaign mode, yet. And we are probably not going to go into the traditional linear narration. Instead, most stories are told from fragmentary sources: you go into the Hangar, you interact with the NPCs and the world environment, learn about the lore, and you’ll get to do missions as special characters.</p><p><strong>IG: We were told you put hundreds of hours of playtime into each mecha. Which one is your favorite?</strong></p></div>



<p>Being not only the producer, but the designer of all the weapon and skill sets and ability designs of all the mechas: they are my children. So I can’t pick a favorite. It wouldn’t be fair. The best answer I can give you right now is who I play with more at any given time: whichever one is the weakest [at the time], that’s who I play the most.</p>



<p><strong>IG: How many more mechas do you have in the works? What’s the eventual roster size you want to see?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>During the initial rollout, we’re going to have 13 playable mechas, there are six other ones that are completely finished and ready to ship, and three more that are a work in progress. The rollout frequency will be about three mechs per season, so we’ve got the first three seasons reserved already. It’s hard to say how many in total the roster will be, but honestly, once you have more and more they’re likely going to have functional overlaps. But I’ll try my very best to provide different expressions, visually, control-wise, and mobility-wise.</p>



<p>Are you one of the thousands playing Mecha BREAK during the open beta? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Winners and losers aren’t decided until the Modern Age, but if you can get a solid early advantage, you'll be even stronger when the finish line approaches. Because of that, you’re going to want a strong start, and choosing the right civilization is key to that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Antiquity Age offers ten civilizations for you and your Leader to choose from. To help make your selection easier, here’s our Civ 7 Antiquity Civilizations tier list.</p><div id="best-civ-7-antiquity-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Civ 7 Antiquity Civs Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S:</strong> Persia, Han, Greece</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Rome, Mississipian, Maurya </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B:</strong> Aksum, Egypt, Maya</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C:</strong> Khmer</p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-persia-1739982429788.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S - Persia</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Hamarana Council</strong> - Infantry Units receive +3 Combat Strength when attacking. +30% Production towards constructing the Gate of All Nations.</li><li><strong>Immortal</strong> - Persian Unique Infantry.

Starts with the Initiative Promotion.</li><li><strong>Pairidaeza</strong> - +1 Culture and Gold. Persian Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Cannot be placed adjacent to another Pairidaeza.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Persia is the quintessential military-minded civilization for the Antiquity Age. A great choice for those who want to be aggressive, get out early, and take over other Settlements. The +3 bonus to all attacking Infantry is a welcome buff, and since Immortals heal after defeating enemies, this creates a great synergy that allows you to continue your assaults with more sustain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Claiming land early is so important in this Age, and a strong military will help you take your rivals’ lands and defend your territory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Persia lacks some of the multi-layered dimensionality of other civilizations that get nice Districts and Builds to bring varied yields, sometimes a battering ram solves all problems. Plus, you can always just take over your rivals' established cities and benefit from their bonuses, too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-han-1739982461508.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S - Han</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Nine Provinces</strong> - The Capital and new Towns gain an additional Population with their first growth event. +30% Production towards constructing Weiyang Palace.</li><li><strong>Chu-Ko-Nu</strong> - Han Unique Ranged Unit.

Can only be trained in Cities with at least 10 Population, and the specific Shi Dafu can only be received once. Cost increases per Shi Dafu trained.</li><li><strong>Great Wall</strong> - +2 Culture. +1 Happiness for adjacent Great Wall segments. Han Unique Improvement. Ageless. Counts as Fortification, +6 Combat Strength when defending. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Can only be built in a line. Cannot branch or fork.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Han allows you to build your borders without getting aggressive and taking Settlements from your fellow civilizations. Getting extra population will help spread your borders and claim key resources within your vicinity early on. This can be a very powerful strategy, especially if you can keep this growth exploding with an abundance of Food. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s nice though, is that Han is also self-protecting. While your Settlements explode in population, the Chu-Ko-Nu is an exceptional defensive ranged unit that will stop any militaristic-minded Civilizations who might try to take your land off of you. The Great Wall is also an excellent defensive structure that brings the benefit of a boost to Culture and Happiness too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-greece-1739982489897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S - Greece</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Demokratia</strong> - +3 Influence per turn on the Palace. +30% Production towards constructing the Oracle.</li><li><strong>Hoplite</strong> - Greek Unique Infantry Unit. +2 Combat Strength if adjacent to another Hoplite.</li><li><strong>Logios</strong> - A Great Person with one charge.

Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Greece has a lot of excellent traits that will really help you create a powerful and varied foundation. For one, Demokatia is a great source of Influence, which can be very valuable in your opening interactions with your fellow Civilizations, allowing you to have open borders for easy-to-navigate routes, as well as start various agreements to try and boost yields you might be falling short on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoplites are a relatively strong Infantry Unit too, that, when attacking in a swarm become near impossible to overcome in the early game. They are versatile too, good on both attack and defense, just as long as you have enough resources to make and maintain several. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greece also offers a really nice, varied selection of Unique Buildings. If you make the Acropolis by constructing an Odeon and Parthenon in the same district, all of them together will be a source of Gold, Happiness, Culture, and Influence. This gives you access to lots of yields, making Greece probably the best jack of all trades in the Antiquity Age. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-rome-1739987173998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A - Rome</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Twelve Tables</strong> - +1 Culture on Districts in the Capital and City Centers in Towns. +30% Production towards constructing the Colosseum.</li><li><strong>Legion</strong> - Roman Unique Infantry Unit. +2 Combat Strength for every Tradition in the Government.</li><li><strong>Legatus</strong> - Roman Unique Army Commander.

This is an excellent choice if you expect to be expanding the amount of Settlements you have quickly. +1 Culture on Districts in the Capital and City Centers can add up if you have a lot of Settlements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, their Army Commander, the Legatus, acts as a hybrid Settler, though you will need to level them up three times to be able to make a new Settlement. However, it’s a good option that saves you the production of several Settlers. The Legion is a decent Infantry Unit, too, that can become very powerful if you are slotting Traditions into your policies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Forum also benefits from Traditions, adding Culture and Gold for each one. You’ll likely want to be outputting a lot of Happiness, which is what the Temple of Jupiter is for. This is a relatively well rounded Civilization for those looking to play wide and enact a lot of policies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-maurya-1739987295970.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A - Maurya</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Dhamma Lipi</strong> - You can choose an additional Pantheon after unlocking Mysticism. +30% Production towards constructing Sanchi Stupa.</li><li><strong>Purabhett</strong> - Maurya Unique Cavalry Unit. +5 Combat Strength against Fortified Districts.

High Happiness means plenty of Celebrations and Social Policies, and if you have enough, you may even be able to ignore Settlement Caps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Matha District provides a percentage based buff on a Settlement that will scale with you through the game, and is an exceptional source of Happiness long into the future. You’ll also be getting big boosts from the Dharamshala and Vihara you needed to produce to make the district. The Nagarika will also give you that boost of Happiness when founding a new settlement. While the Purabhett can be a little situational, it’s still a decent Cavalry unit too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-mississippian2-1739987479368.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A - Mississippian</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Goose Societies</strong> - All Buildings receive a +1 Food Adjacency for Resources. +30% Production towards constructing Monks Mound.</li><li><strong>Burning Arrow</strong> - Mississippian Unique Ranged Unit.

Its Goose Societies will likely align with your natural play, where you try to hoover up as many Resources as possible. If you can get your hands on a lot of them, you will see your cities growing fast. This is an excellent synergy for the Economic Legacy Path. On top of that, the Potkop will only enhance your benefits for doing so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Burning Arrow Ranged Unit is also an excellent defensive or even hybrid Siege unit. Though you may not attack Siege units too often, the Burning status on a tile can make it really difficult for your enemy’s armies to navigate your lands and attack you. Denying that space can be a real decider in a war. It also makes it a good option to bombard Settlements too - just don’t end up burning your own troops with it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-aksum-1739981497868.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B - Aksum</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Kingdom of Natural Wealth</strong> - +2 Gold on Resources. +30% Production towards constructing Great Stele.</li><li><strong>Dhow</strong> - A Unique Naval Unit. +4 Combat Strength on Coast. Has 1 charge to create a naval Trade Route.</li><li><strong>Tankwa</strong> - Aksum Unique Trade Ship. Cannot be pillaged. +10 Trade Route range.</li><li><strong>Hawlit</strong> - +2 Gold. +1 Culture for adjacent Wonders and other Hawilti. Aksumite Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse Bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Flat Terrain.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want Gold, there aren’t many civilizations better at generating it than Aksum. The Kingdom of Natural Wealth trait that gives you +2 Gold for Resources can add up ridiculously quickly, making you an early-game economic powerhouse, able to buy buildings and units to ensure your cities remain modern with your technological advances. You can also build Hawlits next to each other for a further boost of Gold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you find yourself landlocked, or have to travel great distances to get to other Civilizations, you may struggle to maximise your benefits. By water, the Dhow and Tankwa may not be useful in every situation. They lack a land presence that other civilizations may take advantage of with powerful unique units, and unlike Persia, their singular focus on Gold may leave you falling behind elsewhere. That said, if the going really gets tough, the Aksum can just buy themselves an army (though, this can take a couple of turns, so don’t find yourself on the back foot.)</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-egypt-1739987645342.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B - Egypt</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Gift of Osiris</strong> - +1 Production on Navigable Rivers. +30% Production towards constructing the Pyramids.</li><li><strong>Medjay</strong> - Egyptian Unique Infantry Unit. Has no maintenance. +3 Combat Strength in friendly territory, doubled when stationed in a Settlement you own.</li><li><strong>Tjaty</strong> - A Great Person with one charge. Can only be trained in Cities with a Necropolis, and the specific Tjaty received is random. Each Tjaty can only be received once. Cost increases per Tjaty trained.</li><li><strong>Necropolis</strong> - Egyptian Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Mastaba and Mortuary Temple in the same District. Grants 100 Gold (on Standard Speed) when any Wonder is completed in this City.</li><li><strong>Mastaba</strong> - +3 Culture. +1 Gold Adjacency for Navigable Rivers and Wonders. Egyptian Unique Culture Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Mortuary Temple</strong> - +4 Gold. +1 Happiness Adjacency for Navigable Rivers and Wonders. Egyptian Unique Gold Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Egypt is a good Civilization. Activating their unique perks only requires a Navigable River, and since most Settlements should be on a source of water, you should generally be dandy. That said, there's nothing overpowered about Egypt. 100 Gold per Wonder on a Necropolis is nice, as are some extra Gold and Happiness for being Adjacent to Navigable Rivers from the Mastaba and Mortuary Temple. Add the Gift of Osiris, with some extra production, and Eygpt benefits from a nice collection of buffs that certainly add up to a solid package - though without ever offering anything too flashy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Medjay are a great defensive Unit too, deterring any would-be attackers from taking your Settlements. They are particularly good at withstanding pressure from an aggressive city-state, though they lack some of the offensive versatility that other unique Units offer. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-maya-1739988036895.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B - Maya</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Skies of Itzamna</strong> - The Palace gains +0.5 Science for adjacent Vegetated Terrain. +30% Production towards constructing Mundo Perdido.</li><li><strong>Hul’che</strong> - Maya Unique Ranged Unit. Can see through Vegetation and ignore movement penalties from Vegetated Terrain.</li><li><strong>Jaguar Slayer</strong> - Maya Unique Scout. Can initiate combat. Has 1 charge to place a Jaguar Trap that is invisible to enemy Units, dealing 25 damage and ending movement. This ability recharges 5 turns after placing a trap.</li><li><strong>Uwaybil K’uh</strong> - Mayan Unique Quarter. Created by Constructing the Jalaw and K’uh Nah in the same District. Every time you research a Technology, the Settlement gains Production equal to 15% of it’s cost. </li><li><strong>Jalaw</strong> - +3 Happiness. +1 Culture Adjacency for Quarters and Wonders. Mayan Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>K’uh Nah</strong> - +3 Science. +2 Science if placed on Vegetation. +1 Science Adjacency for Wonders. Mayan Unique Science Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mayans have one very strong district attribute going for them. Their Unique Quarter, Uwaybil K’uh, means throughout the rest of the game, every time you research a Technology, the Settlement gains a nice chunk of Production. The fact that this district is percentage-based means this scales exceptionally well through Ages. This is strong enough on its own that you may want to consider choosing Maya, even if the rest of its traits aren’t the best on offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vegetation is not the hardest of the terrains to get access to, but the buffs you get for being on those tiles are relatively middling. Of course, if you start in a heavily vegetated position, you can get some nice benefits, but even then the rewards for meeting those conditions are unlikely to be game-changing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">0.5% Science for the Palace being adjacent to Vegetated Terrain is nice, but likely won’t decide your Age. The Hul’che are a great in these cases too, as enemies will have to fight through vegetation to get at you with their armies, allowing you to hit them ranged from safety. That said, if they are not in Vegetation, than they might as well not be Unique units - and other civilization’s units will more likely run you over if so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The K’uh Nah is a really nice boost to Science that is definitely a great option for the Scientific minded, so there is certainly value here. If you find yourself in dense vegetation, the Mayans can certainly do well for themselves, and offer awesome benefits later in a game. However, they are a little dependent on other factors, and are better for banking on your future. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-khmer-1739988168962.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C - Khmer</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Ksekam Chamnon</strong> - Districts on Rivers do not remove the natural yield of the tile. +30% Production towards constructing Angkor Wat.</li><li><strong>Yuthahathi</strong> - Khmer Unique Cavalry Unit. Higher Combat Strength, but slower Movement. Immune to flood damage. Ignores Zone of Control.</li><li><strong>Vaishya</strong> - Khmer Unique Merchant. Civilian who can establish a Trade Route to import Resources from a foreign Settlement. Immune to flood damage. Ignores movement penalties from Wet Terrain.</li><li><strong>Baray</strong> - +3 Food. +1 Food on all Floodplains in this Settlement. Khmer Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Flat Terrain. One per Settlement.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Khmer definitely have benefits, and could be very strong in the right circumstances. However, they are strong when there are a lot of floods, and though they are relatively common in the Antiquity Age, this means they're still a little situational. Retaining the natural yield on Districts placed on the River isnice to have, but not a universally powerful effect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Yuthahathi is definitely a very interesting unit too, as it is one of the most powerful units in combat in the Age, however, they are slow and lose a lot of ground to Cavalry other Civilizations may be running. The unit is best used as battering rams against armies and Settlements, but if they are smart, your rivals should be able to deal with them by keeping their own Cavalry out of range. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Baray is a nice Unique Building too that really helps boost Food which is certainly powerful in the opening portions of a game. However, you need to be on floodplains for it to become supercharged, which is situational. Again, the Khmer have their place and even have very high potential, but if you spawn on a map and don't have the correct terrain, you may struggle against Civilizations with more reliable abilities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Patrick is a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

We talk about those. We talk about when they're talking about what the story might be, we say, ‘Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,’ and help to deal with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But it's been great, and we've enjoyed it enormously,” Safran said. “Everything had been so siloed, and now that's completely broken down, and it's been great. Because it also applies to consumer products and experiences and everything that DC touches runs up through us now, which is awesome.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when the first game in the DCU will be revealed, Gunn said “a couple of years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it's a couple years, but we've had some pretty active involvement in some stuff coming up,” Safran continued. “It's really interesting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games has had an extremely difficult 12 months, first with the catastrophic release of Rocksteady’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a>, then the disappointing release of Smash Bros.-style brawler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus"><u>MultiVersus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only other recent release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end</u></a> with the delivery of its year one roadmap, and Warner Bros. has announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game"><u>the impending closure of MultiVersus</u></a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop"><u>has suffered significant layoffs</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on just four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble">a new report shed light on the turmoil at Warner Bros. Games</a>, while providing an update on the various projects in the works at its developers. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported</u></a> on concern about the upcoming slate of games from Warner Bros. Games following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch"><u>the exit of chief David Haddad</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg said Monolith Productions’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wonder-woman-the-game"><u>Wonder Woman game</u></a> is in trouble after reportedly rebooting and switching directors early last year. It’s already cost more than $100 million and is still years away from release, Bloomberg added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal, meanwhile, pitched a John Constantine game but it was never approved. A Flash game was scrapped after the DCU Flash film bombed. It’s now helping out with other games and is reportedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche is, as officially announced, working on new content for Hogwarts Legacy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros"><u>as well as a sequel</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And following the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Rocksteady “is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game,” but according to Bloomberg it’s years away. There was no word in Bloomberg’s report on what’s next from NetherRealm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One question is whether Rocksteady’s new Batman video game will be a continuation of its much-loved Arkham series or a DCU video game. There is currently no indication that Monolith Productions’ troubled Wonder Woman game is a DCU video game. So far, no DCU video games have been announced, although in prior comments <a href="https://www.threads.net/@m4noftomorrow/post/C2DQS33y_Fi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunn has said they will be triple-A titles</a>, as opposed to movie tie-ins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, it seems more DC crossovers are coming to Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you talk about interaction with our video game guys, with our gaming department, those are also things that historically there wasn't a lot of collaboration on,” Safran said. “Now it's, hey, we're talking to Fortnite. Which characters should we focus on? Literally, James is signing off on designs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm giving notes on designs,” Gunn confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the first DCU movie, Superman, launches in July, a potential crossover with Fortnite perhaps comes as no surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

With <em>Descenders Next</em>, this time around players will be taking to the slopes across multiple downhill sports. When Next launches in April, it’ll initially bring snowboarding and mountainboarding to the masses, before additional sports are added at a later date.</p><p>That’s not the only big change for <em>Descenders</em>, as we give more powder to the people. Up to 12 players can ride the same mountain slopes, or you can simply shred solo, keeping your sick tricks to yourself. The world is absolutely massive this time around, with huge biomes to explore, and secret parks to discover.</p><p>Hand-crafted parks and races are dotted around the world, with procedurally generated maps connecting everything together, making sure you are travelling off-piste, and not left piste off.</p><p>There’s even more control over your rider this time, with flips, barrel rolls and grinding all on the table. And when you feel like you’ve mastered one mountain, you can simply switch sports and take on a whole new challenge. We doubt you’ll be left feeling board silly.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Top it all off with an absolute banger of a soundtrack from electronic music gods Monstercat, tons of clothing, kits and boards to discover and deck yourself out in, and a raft of updates coming in the future, and it’s all downhill from here for your board-dom levels.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Descenders Next is launching April 9th on PC and Gamepass!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/whbyoSXJaXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With the arrival of a new Superman movie later this year, the new DC Universe continues to grow on film and television. But what about the video games? According to DC Studios co-chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran, DCU games are still in development, but they're still years away from being released.</p><p>"We work incredibly closely with [Global Streaming and Games CEO] JB Perrette, who runs that division, and it's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Brothers," Safran said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-couple-years-before-we-see-the-first-dcu-video-game-james-gunn-says-but-first-fortnite" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "James and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios underneath JB, whether it's NetherRealm or whether it's Rocksteady, sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p><p>It's worth mentioning that there is a difference between a DCU game and a game based on the characters of DC Comics. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/" data-ref-id="1100-6511036">The DC Universe is essentially the umbrella term encompassing the new shared universe</a> overseen by Gunn and Saffran, which includes characters like the new live-action Superman, the Creature Commandos, and a new silver screen incarnation of Batman who'll be introduced in The Brave and the Bold. To make things slightly more confusing, Matt Reeves' The Batman is part of its own continuity, the, The Batman Epic Crime Saga, that includes The Penguin and an upcoming Clayface project.</p><p>Gunn--who directed the new Superman movie--added that the two co-chairs get to see these projects during their earliest phases while also advising the studios on the direction that they could take with DC's characters. "We talk about when they're talking about what the story might be, we say, 'Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,' and help to deal with that," Gunn explained, while Safran added that the first DCU game will be revealed several years from now.</p><p>"Yeah, it's a couple [of] years, but we've had some pretty active involvement in some stuff coming up. It's really interesting," Saffran said.</p><p>Things haven't been rosy for Warner Bros. Games lately, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a critical and financial flop</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/">MultiVersus added to the company's financial woes</a>, and Monolith's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/">Wonder Woman game has reportedly cost more than $100 million to date</a>, with very little progress so far. The same report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier also mentioned that Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal unsuccessfully pitched a John Constantine game and a Flash game was also claimed to be in development until the live-action film bombed, leading to its cancellation.</p><p>The silver lining here is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">Rocksteady is said to be returning to its single-player Batman roots for its next project</a>, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/">WB Games is now focusing its efforts and resources on its biggest franchises</a>.</p>
