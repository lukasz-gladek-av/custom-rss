<p>A brand new infographic shared on the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1951311967353737462">Nintendo of America</a> Twitter account highlights all the games that cropped up in the showcase, split into Switch 2, Switch 2 <em>and</em> Switch 1, and pure Switch 1 categories.</p>
<p>It might not have been the big summer blowout that many of us were hoping for, but seeing all the games laid out like this can't help but get us a little excited. Let's not claim that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> are anything to be scoffed at!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vhmpqz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>All in all, it felt like a somewhat subdued affair (where the heck was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>??), but we have to remind ourselves that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> are all on the horizon from the first-party side of things, so we're still looking at a <em>hell</em> of a launch year for Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're after a more detailed rundown of the entire presentation, you'll find our full round-up below, where we've compiled every game's trailer and blurb text for you to check out as you please.</p>

            <p><em>Beware minor spoilers for Chairbound in this piece. I think they're minor. I have no idea what's truly significant in this dreary purgatory of flourescent lights and rippled glass facades. Only one thing seems guaranteed: I have to get out of here in 10 minutes or I'm doomed.</em></p>
<p>I met the weird little girl again. She was loitering in the shadow of a pillar on the eighth floor. I found her goblin-esque during our first meeting, but up close she seems relatively ordinary, a pale 10-year-old in a nightie with shoulder-length hair. At least, until she burbles distorted sounds at me and runs away into the darkness. I gather she is looking for her "toy". I don't think it's the rubber duck I'm holding.</p><!--more-->
<p>Some other observations about the eighth floor: there are more rubber ducks down here. This is handy intelligence indeed, because it means I don't have to grab the one in the starting office above, saving me 30-60 seconds of abject swivelling and fumbling. I'm still not clear why I would need this rubber duck. It seems perfectly useless. But I don't know for sure that I <em>don't</em> need it, and squeaking the thing pathetically lifts my mood somewhat as I trundle through the office's neat and tidy desolation.</p>
<p>Another thing I've learned: the thing strapped to my chest isn't explosive. When the timer runs down, the display clicks "on", and there's a hiss of initially harmless gas. The first time this happened, I almost died of relief. I figured the timer must have been a prank, a red herring of some kind. Ten minutes to make it down nine stories while tied to a rolling office chair? Of <em>course</em> they were joking. But then my surroundings wobbled and blurred and the shadows took me.</p>
<p>I feel like there must, must be a way to disable this gadget, or extend the timer, because even when I'm being efficient, it takes a good few minutes to descend a single floor. It occurs to me that I dropped the duck on my last attempt, shortly before the gas overwhelmed my senses. Perhaps the duck offers protection from the gas. A voice repeats in my stomach: <em>the duck is the key</em>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Final observations: I managed to get into some kind of computer room on the eighth floor, just below one of the red lights. It contained a stack of displays and another chair, standing in a pool of what I'm pretty sure is blood. This Bodes, for sure. I don't fancy my chances at fighting anybody or anything off while I'm strapped to this chair. Let's reconvene to compare notes on the seventh floor, assuming I make it.</p>

              <p>Mastercard has broken its silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">after being thrust into the middle of a gaming culture war</a> between anti-porn advocates and anti-censorship activists. While Valve previously laid blame for a recent purge of adult sex games from Steam at the feet of ‚Äúpayment processors and their related card networks and banks,‚Äù Mastercard released a statement on Friday denying any responsibility for a new wave of censorship that‚Äôs recently led some gamers to flood payment company call centers with complaints.</p> <p>‚ÄúMastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations,‚Äù the company wrote in a statement published on its website on August 1. ‚ÄúOur payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.‚Äù</p> <p>Mastercard and Visa have been on the receiving end of an anti-game censorship backlash after anti-porn group Collective Shout <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636">claimed victory</a> in a write-in campaign targeting payment company CEOs for allegedly profiting off of what the group called ‚Äúviolent pornography.‚Äù Critics of the move recently told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> they‚Äôve been calling the companies multiple times over the last week to complain about Valve and indie game shop itch.io purging seemingly legal NSFW content from their platforms over fears of reportedly being dropped by Mastercard and others.</p> <p>To be clear, Mastercard doesn‚Äôt say it hasn‚Äôt been involved at all, just that it‚Äôs gone no further than enforcing its existing guidelines against ‚Äúunlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.‚Äù But a renewed crackdown on those requirements, which can be vague in practice, has resulted in Valve and itch.io delisting anywhere from hundreds to thousands of games they worry could get it in trouble with Mastercard and others.</p> <p>Earlier today, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-nsfw-adult-games-visa-mastercard-collective-shout-2000614199">announced the indie storefront</a> is bringing back delisted NSFW games that were free, but is ‚Äústill in ongoing discussions with payment processors‚Äù over paid content which will be reintroduced ‚Äúslowly.‚Äù It could suggest the recent call-in campaigns castigating the credit card companies have changed the calculus for the companies involved. It certainly sounds like Mastercard regrets ever being dragged into this fight, even though it‚Äôs the one in the driver‚Äôs seat.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the calendar transitions from summer to fall, one thing is on the mind of every sports game fan: the release of a new EA Sports FC. EA Sports FC 26 is set to release in a couple of months, and it's going to introduce a slew of new gameplay mechanics and features, while returning with all of the game modes that fans know and love. We've already seen a solid chunk of what the game is going to offer, but there could still be some surprises from EA over the next two months.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot to know about the next entry into EA's soccer franchise, so we're going to take a deep dive into everything we currently know about EA Sports FC 26. Here's what to expect when the game launches later this year.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_EA_Sports_FC_26_be_released_">When will EA Sports FC 26 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">EA has confirmed the release date of EA Sports FC 26 is Sept. 26. This is almost one year to the day of when EA Sports FC 25 was released, which came out on Sept. 27, 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you can't wait that long to play EA Sports FC 26, you can gain up to seven days of early access and start playing on Sept. 19--but only if you pre-order a specific edition of the game. The early access period features the full game, and you'll keep all of your progression during this period after EA Sports FC 26 has been released worldwide. So if you wanted to get a head start in Ultimate Team, for example, the seven days of early access is a huge boon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_preorder_EA_Sports_FC_26">How to preorder EA Sports FC 26</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two editions of EA Sports FC 26 you can preorder: the Standard and Ultimate Edition. Preordering either edition will net you some exclusive bonuses that aim to give you a head start across a variety of game modes. However, preordering the Ultimate Edition is how you gain the seven days of early access that begins on Sept. 19.</p><p dir="ltr">You can see the prices and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-preorder-guide/1100-6533269/">preorder bonuses for the Standard and Ultimate Editions of EA Sports FC 26 in GameSpot's preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">You can preorder either one of these editions of EA Sports FC 26 on your system's marketplace (PS Store, Microsoft Store, Nintendo Store, Steam, EA App). Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/buy" rel="nofollow ">official EA FC 26 section of EA's website</a> and preorder using your system account through there.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Watch_the_EA_Sports_FC_26_trailer_here">Watch the EA Sports FC 26 trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want to see some actual gameplay of EA FC 26, then you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">official reveal trailer</a> below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD</a></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer was received generally well by fans, with many calling it the best reveal trailer for the franchise in years. However, there was a consensus that EA needs to focus on Career Mode with the new game.</p><p dir="ltr">EA went a little deeper into the gameplay side of EA Sports FC 26 with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE8YCIQF2M">Gameplay Deep Dive trailer</a>, which you can watch if you want some more detailed explanations of the changes the game is introducing and how they play out in real time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_platforms">EA Sports FC 26 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for fans across the video game community, EA Sports FC 26 will be available on every major platform when it releases in September. This includes PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2. EA has decided to make the game available on both Switch consoles, an interesting move considering it isn't doing the same for Madden 26, which is only coming to the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to play EA Sports 26 FC on PC, you have the choice of playing on either Steam or via the EA App for Windows. Neither platform has an edge over the other, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_gameplay">EA Sports FC 26 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">EA Sports FC 26 will offer the core content that the franchise has become known for over the years. You'll be able to play Player and Manage Career, Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Live Events, as well as basic Quick Play matches.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to gameplay, EA is making some stark changes to how you play EA Sports FC 26. For starters, there are now two separate gameplay presets: Competitive and Authentic. These presets determine the difficulty level at which you'll be playing, and each is designed for a specific area of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Competitive preset features increased responsiveness and player control with an added emphasis on smarter passing, more intuitive rebounds, and so on. This preset is designed for online game modes, such as Ultimate Team and Clubs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053" data-ratio="0.55620316402998" data-width="1201" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053"></a><figcaption>EA Sports FC 26 is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, the Authentic preset is designed for offline game modes, like Career. You'll find added realism in this preset, making opponents more difficult to play against, and bringing a higher match speed to coincide with how players actually manage the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">Between these two new gameplay presets, you can also take advantage of freshly tuned gameplay fundamentals. EA has taken community feedback and made sweeping changes across a variety of mechanics to make them feel smoother and more responsive. You'll experience better dribbling, more intuitive AI player positioning, and improved animations, among a flurry of other changes. You can read about all of the mechanics EA has changed in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-gameplay-deep-dive#gameplay-fundamentals" rel="nofollow ">dedicated blog post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, EA has also updated goalkeepers in an attempt to make them more fluid and realistic. Goalkeepers have been given new animations and optimized with machine learning to improve their stances and attack readiness. They also have new deflection control mechanics, so you should see balls go where they're supposed to after a goalkeeper makes a nice save.</p>

            <p>Graham is gone. The longest-running editor of Rock Paper Shotgun worked his last day on the website earlier this week, and has leapt quietly into the mysterious realm of the games industry proper. The emotional fallout of this departure is roughly the same as any other time RPS has watched a writer swan-dive out of the RPS treehouse and into the mist far below. There is sadness tinged with hope. "There goes another one," you think, smiling through a single tear and imagining their future life far from these branches. </p>
<p>Only this time, well, it's Graham.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Brendan:</strong> I officially quit RPS myself back in 2019, but have since reappeared as a regular freelance phantom. This gives me the weird opportunity to write a goodbye post for the man who wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brendan-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye">my own goodbye post</a>. Fuck you, Graham, I see your compliments, and I raise you. Eat it.</p>
<p>Back in the horrendous mists of 2014, Graham jumped ship as editor of PC Gamer. He was hired by the ancient founders of Rock Paper Shotgun because the ancient founders were terrible at spreadsheets and were always standing in the wrong place. In Graham Smith, they not only got a managing editor who could tell them what day of the week it was, but a writer who was able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/worst-game-names">eviscerate developers for their terrible names</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-me-more-expressive-actions-in-videogames-please">champion funny new ways to play</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-nidhogg">celebrate the best games of all time</a>, all with the same decorous lethality. </p>
<p>Go through Graham's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/graham-smith">entire author archive</a> and you will find over 4000 articles that collage into a vivid desire for this industry to be more than it often is. Indie physics brawlers stand side-by-side with EA shooters in a swirling list of cool or heinous shit that was important enough to tell you about. Few can write this much this well for this long, and not emerge a master of the knife-like phrase. </p>
<p>"Fuck underscore that," he said of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-pc-review">Watch_Dogs</a>.</p>
<p>Reviewing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/proverbs-review">picrossy game Proverbs</a> he wrote: "It was there when I closed my eyes, as if my brain was defragmenting."</p>
<p>"Makes me feel like I'm on hold," he said of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naiad-review">the wholesome nothingness of Naiad</a>.</p>
<p>I'm picking these articles basically at random. They are probably not the pieces Graham is most proud of writing - only he knows those. But it says a lot that I can dig through his archives in a single morning and find, so easily and quickly, countless examples of wit, energy, and humanity. A humanity that he often expressed privately in our daily meetings, rather than on these digipages. God I wish we'd recorded our meetings as a podcast. We would have broken SO many NDAs. </p>
<p>When I say "humanity" I mean just that. Graham knows that when you write about games, you're really writing about yourself.</p>
<p>"I'm reminded of how precious it is to play a videogame and never need to compete," he wrote of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-living-minecraft">Minecraft in 2014</a>, not knowing then that exploring those mountains and valleys would years later become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-is-turning-15-so-theyre-giving-away-some-character-creator-items">a regular ritual with his son</a>. "Minecraft is a toybox, a dressing-up box, a pencil case of colouring pens, and sometimes just a sunny hill. I played it in 2009 and I played it yesterday and I have no reason to doubt I'll be playing it in 2039." </p>
<p>As somebody who has freelanced for this beautiful cesspit since its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130501155136/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">scrappy red-faced days</a>, I also know the good Graham has done not as a writer, but simply as a guy who can get things done. He dragged this place kicking and screaming into a modern internet that none of us could avoid. Remember when RPS was a traditional blog? It was great. But articles would more or less evaporate when they left the front page. There was only space for three top stories at any one time. Graham oversaw the site as it got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119123851/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">an even bigger splash of top stories</a>. Some readers frothed at the mouth to see the blog roll pushed further down the landing page, reacting with that familiar viciousness we have grown to find adorable in you over years of subsequent RPS facelifts, minor and drastic. But, oh, whaddya know? YOU MOTHER FUCKERS CLICKED ON THOSE TOP STORIES DIDN'T YOU? You filthy, lovely, loyal dirtbags. It is for you Graham killed our darlings. Change is neither good or bad. Change is simply change.</p>
<p>When Graham was first hired, his welcome post wrote that "the tragedy of being editor of any magazine is it dramatically reduces the amount of writing you get to do" and this curse threatened to come to pass when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-not-editor-in-chief-of-rps-anymore-heres-who-is">ascended into the white halls of corpomanagement</a> eight years later to become a bigger, badder directorial man. But the truth is, Graham never stopped writing. He kept doing news posts at nights and weekends. He kept writing news. He kept crushing expensive action adventures and toothless indie darlings with equal knuckle-cracking insight. Okay, he took a hiatus from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-sunday-papers">Sunday Papers column</a> (one of the site's longest traditions) but even that didn't last. </p>
<p>It's in those Sunday Papers pieces that I feel you get the most bang for your Graham buck. Rock Paper Shotgun has always been the home of great writing, and perhaps nobody has built the site's editorial ruleset as much as Graham (with the possible exception of Alice O'Connor, who wrote over 8000 articles and the style guide we use to this day - an untouchable legacy). His <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">final Sunday Papers last week</a> is a fangs-out manifesto for games journalism, and if there is any young pup who still covets this job over the glamour of being an influencer or the solitude of being a video essayist, then their greatest hope for honing their craft lies in Graham's words.</p>
<p>"There are infinite ways to play a game and none of them are wrong," he says. "There are infinite ways to write about a game and some of them are wrong, but you have to decide what those are for yourself."</p>
<p>Or you can just ask Graham. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grahamsmith.bsky.social">follow him, and whatever he'll be doing next, on Bluesky</a>. I suggest you do. Words will burst out of this man if he doesn't write them down somewhere. You'll want to be there when he pops.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I'm still relatively new to the Treehouse and have known Graham for fewer months and years than the other folks here, thus rendering me incapable of writing anything as poetic as Bendy's ode above. But as someone who's read RPS since ye olden days prior to actually getting a job here, I've felt Graham's presence on the site for a long time, and it's been a superb guiding light.</p>
<p>As a fella who also had a long career working in non-games journalism, I feel compelled to add that I've suffered under the hands of many bad editors, and Graham was not one of those. He is the rarest of beasts, the ultimate of Achievements - an actual Chaotic Good guy-in-charge who cares not only about this bizarre corner of the internet, but the people behind it. A real one, in other words. We'll miss you, Graham, and now that you have left us I am currently gathering healing potions to prepare for our swift descent into Lord of the Flies territory.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> Graham, I will miss all those moments in meetings when I'd try to act wise about video games journalism - sorry, videogames journalism - and shame-facedly realise that you'd heard it all before, probably a dozen times over, from successive generations of RPS scribes, all the way back through the great Google Meet invite list of History. You have absorbed everything worth knowing about this business, and it is only fit that you depart for a kinder realm, where you can enjoy your Crunchyroll subscription in peace, and spend less time fielding complaints about deal posts. Please shine down on us occasionally, great beardfather in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Looking at RPS from the outside in, Graham‚Äôs influence is far-reaching and obvious ‚Äì there‚Äôs a reason this site has kept on trucking as long as it has, and that reason has a rich beard and an impressive collection of graphic tees.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> If Jeremy's still new to the Treehouse, my feet have barely cleared the topmost rung of the ladder into it as I write this. I'm sad I didn't get to work with Graham for a lot longer, even if just to try and glean more of the secrets that inevitably lurk within his face fuzz by staring at it in morning meetings.</p>
<p>I wish that everyone currently saying their goodbyes also knew the full extent of Graham‚Äôs impact behind the scenes, that they might clap and wave just that little bit harder. Relatively few people see the Graham that so effortlessly elevates our good ideas (while tactfully squishing our bad ones), or the Graham that lets us disappear for days on end, no questions asked, when things go wrong at home. Or the Graham that always encourages us down the most honest, integrity-paved road through an industry that often isn‚Äôt just unconducive to the principles of good reporting, but actively hostile towards them.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll be fine ‚Äì he‚Äôs seen to that too. But when you think of Graham the writer and editor, know that you can also think of Graham the leader, Graham the shield, Graham the engine. Let‚Äôs thank him once again, for all that and more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/graham-smith-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, if your hearing's recovered enough from the sheer blaring blastiness of yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal</a>, I'm here to tell you a couple of things you'll probably be happy about. Well, unless you're planning on buying it from the Epic Games store.</p>
<p>You see, amid last night's info drop, EA have revealed at least an estimate of the specs your hardware'll need to have to run it, as well as the very important detail of whether you'll need to fire it up via (whispers) the EA launcher.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While EA haven't included any PC specs in their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">lengthy Q&amp;A post</a> about the game, declaring that they'll provide more info further down the line, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/">Steam page</a> has had minimum and recomended setups added to it. Battle in fields 6's minimum reqs comprise the following: an Intel Core i5-7600K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor, 16GB of RAM, 55GB of storage space on a hard drive or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> running at least Windows 10, and your choice of an Nvidia RTX 2060 or an AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB.</p>
<p>Judging by those, provided your rig's not beyond half a decade old, there's a chance you'll not need to look into upgrading to pass the low threshold required to at least get BF6 running, though EA don't specify the kind of quality and FPS count bang you can expect for that buck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recomended specs as as follows: Intel Core i7-10700, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processors, 16GB of RAM, 80GB of drive space, Windows 11, and either an Nvidia RTX 3060Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 6700-XT. Again, no indication as to what that'll get you, aside from suggesting it should be decent. That said, buggy Battlefield launches have been a thing in the past. Our James only ran into one while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">diving into the multiplayer at a recent Battlevent</a>, though.</p>
<p>If you've been more worried about having to summon EA's app every time you want to play it, then the good news is that if you're on Steam that won't be necessary.. Though you will still need an EA account, because as French philosopher Denis Diderot apparently once said, man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest. Those who buy it via the Epic Store'll need both EA app and EA account, because as French philosopher Denis Diderot definitely didn't say, sorry Fortnite platform peeps.</p>
<p>Oh, and before I go, EA also make clear that "you do not need to have played any other Battlefield game to understand or enjoy Battlefield 6". It's unclear whether an understanding of the concept of a battlefield, or the individual concepts of battles or fields will be required. I'm going out on a slightly exploded limb to say probably not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734"><i><span>Marvel T≈çkon: Fighting Souls</span></i></a><span>, the Arc System Works fighting game starring all your favorite Marvel heroes, isn‚Äôt coming out until next year. You might be wondering, then, why the studio put out a lengthy beginner‚Äôs guide for the game when no one‚Äôs playing it. That‚Äôs because the game is playable this weekend at EVO in Vegas, and while the lucky FGC die-hards in attendance are getting some hands-on time with it, the rest of us are at least getting some crumbs, seeing the game in action with a breakdown of its mechanics. If you want to watch the full guide, you can do so below. For everyone who just wants the bullet points, read on.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MARVEL T≈çkon: Fighting Souls Beginner's Guide" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1c9TcMIWfA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>You won‚Äôt have access to all four of your characters at the start of a match</h2> <p><i><span>Fighting Souls </span></i><span>is a 4v4 game, which sounds incredibly overwhelming. It still might be, but unlike </span><i><span>Marvel vs. Capcom</span></i><span>, you won‚Äôt be able to switch freely between your characters right off the bat. Matches will start as 2v2 fights, with you gradually gaining access to the other two fighters when you throw an opponent and trigger a stage transition, slam an enemy into a stage corner, or lose a round. Unlike in </span><i><span>Marvel vs. Capcom</span></i><span>, your characters don‚Äôt have separate health bars but instead share one, and building your team across a match increases the values of your Vital (aka health) and Skill Gauges, allowing you to use more special moves and assist maneuvers. This means there‚Äôs a lot of incentive to try and send your opponent flying through the stage quickly so you can build up your team as fast as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Each fighter has a ‚Äúunique‚Äù move alongside the standards</h2> <p><span>The video runs through the control scheme, and a lot of it is the kind of stuff you‚Äôd expect. You move back to block, and every character has light, medium, and heavy attacks. That‚Äôs all fighting game fundamentals. However, each character also has a ‚Äúunique‚Äù move that gives them a more distinct playstyle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Here are the unique moves revealed thus far:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Captain America: He throws his shield, and it ricochets off the corners of the screen</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Iron Man: Uses long-range repulsor blasts</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ms. Marvel: Pulls herself across the stage using her stretchy arms</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Storm: Throws a gust of wind toward her foe</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Star-Lord: Changes the element of his gun between a flamethrower and cryobeam</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Doctor Doom: Create a shield that nullifies projectiles</span></li> </ul> <p><span>The video didn‚Äôt show Ghost Rider or Spider-Man‚Äôs unique moves, but I imagine we‚Äôll hear what those are when people play </span><i><span>Fighting Souls </span></i><span>at EVO.</span></p> <p><span>While the Unique moves are special moves that are specific to each hero, they‚Äôre not the only distinguishing attacks in a character‚Äôs move pool.&nbsp; Each character has Skills you can activate that lean into their personalities and fighting styles. Captain America can do more precise shield throws, and Star-Lord can throw grenades that stun his enemies. You can use your Skill Gauge to increase their power, and if you‚Äôve got 100 points in that gauge, you can use a Super skill. The game does a pretty sick comic-style cut-in when you use those, so </span><i><span>Fighting Souls</span></i><span> is definitely leaning into the idea of these characters as comic-book heroes first and foremost.</span></p>

 <h2>Juggling your allies might require some technical practice</h2> <p><span>The prospect of playing as four characters at once sounds pretty daunting, and Arc System Works‚Äô breakdown of how you can utilize a full team makes it seem a lot more complex than just swapping between them at will. There are assist abilities that you can use and then swap right into the character who‚Äôs helping you out, for instance, or you can use multiple assists at once and, depending on the order in which you summon those allies, you can swap to the latest teammate you called in, and the attack they‚Äôll use depends on which of the three slots they‚Äôre in. On top of this, there are several more powerful maneuvers your allies can help you with, such as juggling an opponent and throwing them around the screen. These attacks drain your Assemble Gauge, but help you break through enemy defenses or counter an incoming strike. You can even stack several Super Skills on top of each other if you‚Äôve got the full gauge to do so. The ‚ÄúCrossover‚Äù counter mechanic feels reminiscent of </span><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i><span>‚Äôs Drive Impact in that it can call in an ally to defend your primary character and stun your opponent. Getting the timing down for all of these mechanics will require some practice. The sheer number of options at your disposal is pretty staggering, but I know the best in the FGC are going to perform some mindblowing combos and plays with this tech.</span></p> <p><i><span>Marvel T≈çkon: Fighting Souls </span></i><span>is coming to PS5 and PC in 2026 as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-announced-all-trailers-state-of-play-ps5-ps4-1851783654"><span>part of a publishing deal with Sony</span></a><span>. The PlayStation company also owns EVO now, so it seems like it‚Äôs trying to get as many footholds in the fighting game community as it can, including funding a fighting game based on one of the biggest entertainment properties in the world.</span></p>

          <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">Slowed tech progress</a>, inflation, and global trade wars are doing a number on game console pricing this year, and the bad news keeps coming. Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">delayed</a> preorders of the Switch 2 in the US and increased accessory prices, and Microsoft gave its Series S and X consoles across-the-board price hikes<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">in May</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo is back for more, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">increasing prices</a> on the&nbsp;<em>original</em> Switch hardware, as well as some Amiibo, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nintendos-new-clock-tracks-your-movement-in-bed/">the Alarmo clock</a>, and some Switch and Switch 2 accessories. The price increases will formally take effect on August 3.</p>
<p>The company says that there are currently no price increases coming for the Switch 2 console, Nintendo Online memberships, and physical and digital Switch 2 games. But it didn't take future price increases off the table, noting that "price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</p>
<p>Nintendo didn't announce how large the price increases would be, but <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvdvrv55rd2x">some retailers</a> were already listing higher prices as of Friday. Target now lists the Switch Lite for $229.99, up from $199.99; the original Switch for $339.99, up from $299.99; and the OLED model of the Switch for a whopping $399.99, up from $349.99 and just $50 less than the price of the much more powerful Switch 2 console.</p>

In this game, players can prey on each other for critical supplies. And now, the franchise is heading to a new frontier with Rust Mobile, which will officially debut at Gamescom 2025 from August 20-24 for the title's first hands-on experience. An announcement trailer for Rust Mobile has also been released, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O_L8APT51Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8O_L8APT51Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Level Infinite developed Rust Mobile, which adds a few new touches to its PC predecessor. Players can explore "a real-time, fully immersive world" where they have to fend off rival players as well as the hostile wildlife that is native to the area. All of the core elements of the original game remain intact, including exploration, crafting, base-raiding, and battles to the death.</p><p>The trailer hints that players may be given warnings that their bases are under attack alongside an invitation to jump back into the game to defend what's theirs. There may also be the possibility of trust between players, but there's a far greater chance of betrayal. Players ultimately get to choose how they want to survive, and if their characters will follow any moral code.</p><p>Rust Mobile doesn't currently have a release date, but interested players are encouraged to preregister at <a href="https://rustmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official site</a>.

<section><p>After spending around five and half hours with Silent Hill f, I'm convinced that the series is not just back--it's at its strongest</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">As I sat down for the first of many discussions with the Silent Hill f team during my trip to Konami's Tokyo headquarters, longtime series composter Akira Yamaoka mentioned there was one philosophy in particular that guided his work on the upcoming title: wabi-sabi. Though I certainly won't claim to be the best person to succinctly summarize this ideology, as I have always understood it, wabi-sabi is about finding beauty in the transient nature of life--in imperfection, impermanence, aging, and even decay. According to Yamaoka, capturing "the feeling of the passing of time" was something he strived to do with his music; based on the time I spent with the game and music I encountered I think he succeeded. But more than that, Yamaoka made me realize just why Silent Hill f was so affecting, and why I can't stop thinking about the time I spent playing it two weeks later.</p><p dir="ltr">In Silent Hill f, beauty and decay are interwoven; flowers melt flesh; clotted rot devours once-proud structures. And yet, all of this grotesquerie is gorgeous, both visually and in the sense of somber it stirs. I was moved by Silent Hill f's visuals and the sheer artistry on display. But beyond that, I was also moved by how the series' signature examination of the human mind--which in this case, honed in on the psyche of a young teenage girl being violently thrust towards womanhood--brought me back to my own adolescence; to a time I'll never again return to and was as isolating and horrifying as it was precious and fundamental. To a part of me that, in a sense, has decayed. Not every game can invoke such a response, especially in just under six hours, and yet, Silent Hill f did.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1391744872" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Despite the success of Silent Hill 2's remake last year, it's safe to say there was still some speculation as to if the series was truly "back." I'd now go so far as to say it's not only back, it's stronger than ever, and that Silent Hill f has the potential to be the best game in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a bold claim made bolder by the fact that, while a few SIlent Hill games have technically taken place outside the titular Silent Hill, Silent Hill f is the first that seems to be completely removed from the foggy New England town. Instead, Silent Hill f embraces Konami's idea that Silent Hill is a state of mind. For protagonist Hinako, "Silent Hill" takes shape as a fog- and rot-coated version of her hometown, the fictional rural village of Ebisugaoka, Japan. Silent Hill f distinguishes itself in another way too, as it trades in the series' more contemporary setting for the late 1960s--a period of time which the Silent Hill f team chose because it felt like the point in time in which the "fantasy" of Japan and its technologically-focused future collided.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill f's events kick off quickly, a fact I appreciated and that kept the lingering sense of dread tangible. After witnessing yet another argument between her parents, Hinako leaves home in search of someone--anyone--to keep her distracted and talk to her. Based on that and her journal entries, we can tell she is a deeply lonely character, even if she seems to have friends and an older sister she deeply admires and who looks out for her; this fact quickly endeared her to me, despite not much having happened at this point. By the time she makes her way down the fog-drenched foothills and to Ebisugaoka's winding, Kanayama-inspired alleyways, she is thrust into a nightmare scenario befitting the Silent Hill series, albeit with plenty of added friend drama, and a second, yokai-filled spirit world she is sometimes sent to. And yes, the latter is just as fascinating, dark, and beautiful as it sounds; despite loving exploring Ebisugaoka, I was always eager to return.</p><p dir="ltr">As a high school-age girl, Hinako is no weapons expert. Though she can certainly swing a metal pipe--and can even wield ceremonial daggers and a naginata when in the spirit world--its advisable to use her track and field experience to evade enemies and pick your battles. A large part of this is because Silent Hill f puts a huge emphasis on resource management, in part by bringing back weapon degradation. Though this can be a contentious choice, I thought it worked extremely well and reflected the game's overall theme of decay, be it physical or mental.</p><p dir="ltr">On the subject of degradation, and in addition to your standard health and stamina bars, Silent Hill f adds a sanity meter to the game, another contentious choice that, when handled poorly, can feel off-putting. However, I found it works well within the game. In addition to avoiding stigmatizing mental health, it also doesn't feel like just another arbitrary gauge, as it allows Hinanko to engage in a special focus ability that, when activated, better alerts her as to when she can get a critical strike on an enemy. Naturally, closely observing enemies causes her sanity to drain, and when it's empty, she loses the ability to hone in and is left to find advantageous times on her own.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to weapon degradation, a new layer of resource management is added via the way permanent upgrades work in Silent Hill f. Scattered throughout Ebisugaoka and the spirit world are shrines Hinako can pray at, which saves your progress. Once there, she can also generate faith by enshrining objects, including those used to heal. Once an object is converted into faith, she can then draw omamori, which gives her a random accessory with its own boon, or permanently upgrade one of her stats. This adds an interesting element of choice and strategy: do you hang on to your various healing items to use in battle, or convert them into faith for permanent upgrades? Granted, there are certain items that can solely be enshrined, and plenty of goods that can only be consumed, but when it comes to the rest, it's up to players to decide how to presume.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">There was still some speculation as to if the series was truly 'back.' I'd now go so far as to say it's not only back, it's stronger than ever, and that Silent Hill f has the potential to be the best game in the series</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">For the most part, I enjoyed Silent Hill f's combat. It's more fluid than previous entries and I loved how weighty Hinako's swings--and fumblings--felt. It's nothing revolutionary, but I don't particularly look for top-tier action in psychological horror games. There is a slight hiccup, though, as managing resources and avoiding engaging in every fight means navigating Ebisugaoka's tight alleyways. While tight corners, dead-ends, and a close camera add satisfying tension to the game, it can definitely feel a bit frustrating and restrictive when a blood-covered mannequin is stalking you and an arguably too slowly refilling stamina bar keeps winded as you try to dodge its attacks. At a certain point, it made the fear give way to aggravation--and made me desperately long for faster stamina regeneration, even after giving myself a few upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">All this said, the Silent Hill series is arguably better known for its solid level design and puzzles, and Silent Hill f definitely delivers on both fronts. Much like the town of Silent Hill, Ebisugaoka is beautiful, eerie, anxiety-inducing, and a delight to explore--even if it does mean facing off against gore-covered abominations. It's also deceptively large and feels a lot less linear than you might expect. In fact, there are certain houses and areas that have wholly self-contained stories that, while not mandatory to do, can impact which ending Hinako winds up getting in later playthroughs (all players are locked into the canon ending the first time they play), making exploration all the more enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">Also like previous Silent Hill games, Silent Hill f also has a number of great set pieces including vast farmlands, darkened temples, and a dilapidated middle school, the latter of which will delight anyone who loved navigating Silent Hill 2's apartments. Though the puzzles I encountered weren't too difficult to solve, they were still fun headscratchers that saw me closely examining scarecrows, deciphering locker code language designed by middle schoolers, sorting through omamori to find the right images to accompany lengthy poems, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">While on the subject of things the Silent Hill series does well, I'd be remiss not to mention Silent Hill f's music and sound design, both of which are phenomenal. Composer Yamaoka does a tremendous job weaving together tracks that sound like Silent Hill while also incorporating more traditional Japanese instrumentation, guttural singing, and a children's choir. All of this makes the overall experience far more haunting, while the 3D sound design makes it all-encompassing as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Even taken purely at surface level, Silent Hill f's is a great experience, and the story woven in its first five hours--one of a young girl navigating rot-filled alleys and teenage psychological warfare --completely pulled me in. And yet, there was both room and this compulsion to dive deeper; deeper into Hinako's headspace, and what it meant to be a woman coming of age in 1960s Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a subject I was a bit shocked to see so blatantly explored in Silent Hill f, especially considering the current climate. Although horror as a genre is actually phenomenal at facilitating conversations about adolescence and womanhood--and I'd argue that the Silent Hill series itself has done this subtly but extremely well in the past--this isn't a topic often approached in video games. During my interview with the Silent Hill f team, I asked them if it was their intention to explore gender roles, relationship dynamics between men and women, and the "horrors" of being a teenage girl. Ryukishi07 then told me that not only was it intentional, it was a part of the game he took "a lot of effort into depicting purposefully," and it shows.</p><p dir="ltr">"Since the protagonist is a girl, I believed that it was important to explore the things that would be most intimate and personal to her. From her perspective, it was important relationships--to her family and the ones that she has with her friends," Ryukishi07 said. "The relationship she has with her family is probably the most intimate and visceral, in a way. So I believe these are parts that I took a lot of effort into depicting purposely."</p><p dir="ltr">Though how things unfold exactly remains to be seen, so far I am incredibly impressed by the confidence, subtlety, and acuteness with which Konami is exploring a young girl's psyche and how isolating becoming a woman can be. Be it jabs thrown at Hinako regarding how "manly" she speaks, the subtle ways one of her "friends" undermines her femininity in front of one of their male friends, the strain that now exists between her and her aforementioned male friend as attraction becomes a concern, the shallow magazines with articles claiming "a woman is only complete once she is loved," or, most compellingly, the many journal entries Hinako pens that explain how marriage has ruined her older sister and how her mother and father's abusive dynamic has affected her, Silent Hill f is unabashed in its efforts to bring players into Hinako's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, I think there is one other exciting vessel for exploring Hinako's inner-workings that needs to be touched on: a new, unnamed character that I can already tell is going to be <em>extremely</em> popular in the Silent Hill fandom, the fox-masked man. Though I can't speak too in depth about his character yet, suffice it to say that those who were *ahem* <em>awakened </em>by Spirited Away's Haku or Labyrinth's Jareth are going to love the white haired demon and his k-pop idol good looks--even if there is something vaguely threatening about him. After encountering him a few times throughout the game, my face nearly blushing as I watched him coax Hinako with kind words and lead her through the dark spirit world he seems to inhabit, I decided I needed to ask the Silent Hill f team is they intended to create a character that fans were going to obsess over.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, that's the initial answer," director Al Yang laughed. "There will definitely be people who like him. In the company, I know half of the people are like, 'Oh, this guy's a dream boat.' And the other half is like, 'I don't trust this dude.' It's very both ways, but that's good.

Since the game was announced, many have speculated as to what that little red "f" in the game's title could mean. Though many have been quick to assume that--based on its curvature--it stands for forte, the Silent Hill team has been coy when it comes to revealing what it actually stands for. In fact, based on their comments and the fact that the game has five different endings (yes, including a UFO one), it seems as though it could stand for a number of things, with different players having different interpretations.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do have a lot of different meanings infused into the letter F. But that's something that we would like to leave as an open-ended question for the players to explore and come to their own conclusions," series producer Motoi Okamoto said.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, we won't have to wait too much longer to get to work on answering these questions and discovering just what that "f" might mean. Silent Hill f launches on September 25, 2025, and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

This article contains minor, non-narrative spoilers (specifically, Bananza forms and mid-game layers).</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Did you know there was a U-turn jump in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>? I just realised this morning! He does a roll jump (that can be chained into another air roll) and lands with a sonar splash. I'm not exactly sure how useful it is but it's an expressive delight just to discover and do, and really that's the whole game?</p>
<p>Other things I‚Äôve only realised in the post-game: Kong Bananza's charge punch sends a shockwave projectile that tunnels through stone with <strong>Dragon Ball</strong>-ish delight; You get more airtime with the spin jump when holding a chunk in hand, helicoptering down like a sycamore seed; You can turn off Pauline's singing for the Bananzas in the settings, which I'm a little torn on - it's a relief to maintain Level Vibes Unbroken without those noisy earworms, but I do also love getting to get to the elephant‚Äôs middle eight (shake your, shake your body!).</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4xouims&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Also, it turns out you can be so Bananza-pilled that you get oddly excited by the wet clumps of sand in the construction site next to your gym?</p>
<p>And now that we‚Äôve all had a chance to bed into Bananza, shall we stop with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> comparisons? Now we have both! The poise and solidity of Odyssey and the freeform painterly pulverising of DK. Both games revel in the music of movement - and how brilliant this new instrument is.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think the game is like eating. For Donkey Kong it literally is, as he munches through ever more crystal Banandium. But also for us, as we punch through the world just for the tactile pleasure of it. It feels less like depleting the environment so much as tasting its textures, like the just-so powdery snow or the <em>thwunk</em> of cracking through coloured concrete to sapphire glinting beneath. I‚Äôm a big fan of the light plectrum <em>twang</em> in the pad as you climb metallic surfaces, and surely everyone loves the summer squelch of tunnelling through watermelons in the Resort Layer.</p>
<p>The game just says 'Yes' to everything! Bejewelled Zebras happily carry on chatting in a pit you‚Äôve carved below the village they were just in. A fractone butler‚Äôs pieces punch away with xylophone notes. And of all the sounds in the game, that <em>thwack</em> of the slap as you high-five one of the burrowing eels? It‚Äôs practically physical. Surely no other game has doubled down so much on breaks and cracks and grabbing and grasping as a sort of mode of engagement? Like that unthinking pinching as you walk through TK Maxx just testing the feel of the fabrics. Like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ico">ICO</a>‚Äôs Yorda hand-hold, but the whole darn level. And with more punching.</p>
<p>Then you combine this with <em>ridiculous</em> flow and fluidity. The roll jump leads into that big lolopping leap, the ground-grab happens seamlessly without missing a beat, and the plunging plummet punch can be released into a featherlight landing. For a big boy, DK can be outstandingly nimble, making for a brilliantly unique gameflow where the whole game becomes DK Artist, moving and doodling through the environments leaving scuffs and patches in your wake. Then punching a purple shark that curves away in a rainbow arc.</p>
<figure><a title="Finding this place made me unreasonably happy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/922d068da16a3/finding-this-place-made-me-unreasonably-happy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Finding this place made me unreasonably happy ‚Äî <em>Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, back to Odyssey. I get all the comparisons, it‚Äôs from the same team after all. And it's a useful way to compare and contrast to better see what Bananza is doing differently - an understood lingua franca (because basically everyone loves Odyssey).</p>
<p>But Bananza takes longer to hit its stride, then sprints, then flies. I thought it was peaking with a dig-down shanty town, but <em>then</em> there were sunlight fights in shatter-glass corridors (you‚Äôll know it when you get to it). And it turns out it hadn‚Äôt even gotten <em>crazy</em> crazy. And now I‚Äôm loving the post-game and all its teachings about moves and Bananzas I thought I knew.</p>
<p>But even that‚Äôs not the point. Like Odyssey before it, I'll probably have Bananza installed for most of my Switch 2's life, even having gobbled through the outrageously moreish campaign (well done Nintendo for the enjambment of chucking my Bananas down the next hole!), even when I‚Äôve rinsed the post-game for all its trinkets. Because I really love the post-post game, where the game‚Äôs earned your affection and now all the play and messing about is just doing reps of delight. When it‚Äôs just a texture of play that you have at hand for when you fancy.</p>

<p>Sometimes I‚Äôll fancy Odyssey‚Äôs move-chaining and pinpoint precision, the spring off a car in New Donk City or the squeak of an Uproot jump in Wooded Kingdom - its very <em>definite</em> gamefeel in general. Other times, I‚Äôll load up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> for that weightier momentum and rocketing triple jump. And now I‚Äôve got Bananza for when I want this mad, Dubai-Chocolate game of gaudiness and gold and crunch and chunks, where walls and floors aren‚Äôt obstacles but just the sea in which DK swims (punches).</p>
<p>Which is the level I‚Äôll most come back to in Bananza, I wonder? At first I thought it‚Äôd be the Jungle Layer with its dark-green and jungle drums, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> vibes, and that brilliant feeling of throwing a seed and jumping early just as air turns to vine.</p>
<p>But then it just got better.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There‚Äôs a new turn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/715299/itchio-games-delisting-payment-processor-paypal">in the itch.io story</a>. <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">In a forum post</a>, itch.io creator and founder Leaf Corcoran has notified users that the company has begun the process of restoring thousands of NSFW pages that were deindexed ‚Äî that is, content that has been removed from search results and recommendation lists. The catch is that in order for deindexed content to be restored, it has to be listed as free. This is ostensibly because there can be no objection from payment processors if there are no payments being processed for prohibited material.</p><p>‚ÄúToday, we are re-indexing free adult NSFW content,‚Äù Corcoran wrote. He went on to explain that the company is actively working to restore paid NSFW content, but that will take some time. ‚ÄúWe are still in ongoing discussions with payment processors and will be re-introducing paid content slowly to ensure we can confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term.‚Äù</p><p>The itch.io adult content ban began last week, with the indie storefront announcing that it had <a href="https://itch.io./updates/update-on-nsfw-content">mass deindexed all content labeled as ‚ÄúNSFW‚Äù or ‚Äúadult‚Äù</a> in the face of mounting pressure from the site‚Äôs payment processors. That pressure, Corcoran said, is what caused the rather abrupt and disruptive action that resulted in over 20,000 pages containing games, books, comics, artwork, and more being deindexed virtually overnight and with no advance communication.</p><p>‚ÄúTo ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance,‚Äù Corcoran wrote in the original announcement.</p><p>Since then, itch.io creators and more have mounted <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal">a massive pushback campaign</a>, calling up payment processors like Visa and Mastercard demanding they let itch.io conduct business as usual. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Mastercard‚Äôs senior vice president of communications, Seth Eisen, denied allegations that it is essentially censoring its client, writing:</p><div><blockquote><p>‚ÄúMastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations. Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.‚Äù</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>‚ÄúVisa does not discriminate against legal transactions. Some merchants, such as adult content or gambling sites that operate legally, face an elevated risk of illegal activity, and we require enhanced safeguards for acquirers supporting merchants in these industries.‚Äù</p></blockquote></div><p>In the meantime, Corcoran said that Stripe, one of itch.io‚Äôs payment processors for over 10 years, will not support NSFW content at all, but added that itch.io is working to find new business partners.</p><p>‚ÄúWe are in the process of talking with other payment partners to accept card payments that Stripe is unable to process,‚Äù Corcoran wrote. ‚ÄúOur long-term plan is to implement one or more new processors to avoid putting the platform at risk.‚Äù</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/717393/itchio-adult-content-ban-restoring-free-nsfw-pages]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124"><i>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 3+4</i></a> has a sizable roster of skaters to choose from. Whether you choose from the 29 that are immediately available or go with an unlockable skater like <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Magera</a>, each one feels different thanks to a unique layout of stats.</p> <p>That might be a problem if someone you like doesn‚Äôt play as comfortably as you want. Fortunately, collectible Stat points in each level can be used to upgrade everyone on the roster. So let‚Äôs go over every stat‚Äôs purpose and which ones you should invest in first.</p> <h2>What each stat means</h2> <p>Anyone new to this series is bound to feel a little lost from the onslaught of terms and actions. There is a lot to remember from the tutorial, and ten skater stats don‚Äôt help in that regard. Here‚Äôs an explanation for what each stat determines:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Air:</b> The maximum height you get from jumping off a half pipe</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hangtime:</b> How long you can stay in the air after jumping off a half pipe</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Ollie:</b> How high you jump while on flat ground</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Speed:</b> The maximum speed you can reach on the ground</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Spin:</b> How fast you spin while in the air</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Switch:</b> Affects how well you skate in the alternate stance</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Flip Speed:</b> How quickly flip tricks turn</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Rail Balance:</b> The stability of the grinding rail meter</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Lip Balance:</b> The stability of the Lip Trick meter</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Manual Balance:</b> The stability of the Manual meter</li> </ul> <h2>What are the best stats to prioritize?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614382"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614382">¬© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With such a wide variety of tricks and options, every player will skate a bit differently. This is more apparent once we factor in all of the different maps. Nevertheless, some stats are more useful when you‚Äôre starting out.</p> <p><b>If you‚Äôre unsure what stats to prioritize putting points into, we suggest focusing on Air, Speed, and Rail Balance.</b> Being able to move faster and jump higher off half pipes will make a huge difference on their own, but we can‚Äôt discount how nice it feels to grind rails more easily. Manual Balance and Hangtime are some great alternate choices if the Skater you‚Äôre using already has high values in the other stats.</p>

 <p>Something else worth pointing out is that point allocation isn‚Äôt set in stone. You can remove any added points and redistribute them to your heart‚Äôs content. All you need to do is pause the game, switch over to the Skater tab with R1/RB, and then select the Stats box to edit them. This can even be done in the middle of a run, which is great if you need to readjust for a competition level or need a bit more Speed to get a Secret Tape.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>

you can start playing right when the game launches, you'll want to preorder an edition. Preordering allows you to pre-download Madden 26 before it releases, and as mentioned, can get you early access if you preorder the correct version.</p><p dir="ltr">On any platform, you can preorder Madden 26 by going to your system's marketplace (PS Store, Microsoft Store, Nintendo Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, EA App). You can also visit the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/buy" rel="nofollow ">official Madden 26 website</a> and place your preorder by following the steps on the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to preorder, you'll need to pick an edition to buy. For lots more, be sure to consult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-preorder-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-xbox-series-x-amazon-walmart/1100-6531099/">GameSpot's Madden 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">If you already own College Football 26, you'll want to stick with the Madden 26 Deluxe Edition, as the main draw of the MVP Bundle is that it also includes a copy of CFB 26. You can also preorder the Madden 26 Standard Edition for some extra content, but you won't get early access with your purchase.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Watch_the_Madden_26_trailer_here">Watch the Madden 26 trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about seeing some gameplay of Madden 26 before you decide to make a purchase, or to just build your hype a bit, you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ">official trailer</a> for the game below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ</a></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer, which was released on June 4, showcases some of the new content coming to the game, including cover athlete Saquon Barkley's backwards jump mechanic. However, if you're interested in Franchise Mode, we recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV4VXk6CG98&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">Franchise Deep Dive trailer</a> for Madden 26. This offers an in-depth look at all of the changes EA has made to the mode.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Madden_26_platforms">Madden 26 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Madden 26 is arriving on all major platforms that one might expect in 2025. You can play the football game on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time that a Madden game has arrived on a Nintendo Switch console. With the recent release of the Switch 2, EA is making use of the upgraded technology of the console to make Madden 26 playable. If you want to see how Madden 26 plays on the Switch 2, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/">early preview of the game on the console</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're going to play on PC, you have the option of playing on Steam, Epic Games, or the EA App for Windows. The PC platform you use doesn't make a huge difference, so pick whichever one you're more comfortable with. However, the EA App often discounts the Madden games before and after they are released, so going through that platform could mean a slight price reduction for you.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Madden_26_gameplay_changes">Madden 26 gameplay changes</h2><p dir="ltr">As you might expect with a new Madden game, the core gameplay experience is remaining the same in Madden 26. Franchise Mode, Madden Ultimate Team, Superstar Mode, and Quick Play are all coming back to give you a variety of different ways to play. All 32 NFL teams and all of the players on those teams will be included and playable, just like any other year, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Madden 26 is changing up its game modes in several ways and has also added some new gameplay mechanics. The highlight of these mechanics is the backwards jump made famous by Eagles running back Saquon Barkley in a 2024 regular season game. Player movement as a whole has also been changed in Madden 26, offering a snappier and more explosive feel. Be careful not to get trucked, though, as EA has added more physics-based interactions to make collisions more realistic.</p><p dir="ltr">On the field in Madden 26, you'll see more team- and fan-specific elements than ever. These include special team art, fan traditions, and special stadium anthems to make you feel like you're really attending an NFL game. All 32 NFL teams have been taken into account, so no matter where you play, you'll see some kind of unique element.</p><p dir="ltr">Franchise Mode has been updated in a few major ways in Madden 26. You can now choose one of four Coach Archetypes before starting the mode if you create your own coach, which is something College Football 26 fans are familiar with. These Coach Archetypes can then be upgraded with new abilities as you progress with your Franchise. Abilities change how your coach operates and what strengths they have access to. You can customize all aspects of your coaching style with these abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Franchise Mode still offers the chance to take control of your favorite NFL head coach if you want their specific strengths. NFL head coaches still have access to the new abilities, but now, your coordinators matter more than ever. If you design or pick an offensive-minded head coach, you'll want more input from a good defensive coordinator on a week-to-week basis. Speaking of which, Franchise Mode now offers Weekly Gameplans, which can be used to meticulously plan for an upcoming opponent.

Like last year, Madden 26 allows you the ability to transfer your College Football 26 Road to Glory players into Superstar Mode, giving you the chance to continue using your created players.</p><p dir="ltr">Superstar Mode also now features Career Chapters for more progression and added consequences to your actions. You can use the Sphere of Influence in conjunction with the Career Chapters to see how your player is performing in the eyes of the coaches and fans. It all seems very intuitive and should provide Superstar players with added layers of depth during their playthroughs. You can read more about those systems and the other changes in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/madden-26-gridiron-notes-superstar-deep-dive" rel="nofollow ">Superstar Mode in EA's blog</a>.</p>

			<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is a new turn-based RPG from developer and publisher Epictellers Entertainment, that's currently set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 as an early access title on Steam. There's also a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight">Kickstarter campaign</a> players can register their interest in now, to be a part of the development journey for this new sci-fi fantasy adventure.</p>



<p>Set in the world of the popular tabletop role-playing game, Starfinder, this new adventure includes new characters, each with their own unique story lines, and brings Starfinder's second edition ruleset to the digital world for the first time.</p>



<p>Epictellers Entertainment will be working in collaboration with Starfinder's creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathfinder-kingmaker-crpg-chris-avellone/">Paizo</a>, on the project, but Epictellers will be the ones both publishing and leading development on the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We‚Äôre thrilled to unveil Starfinder: Afterlight in partnership with Paizo,</em>" said Epictellers Entertainment co-founder and chief executive officer, Ricard Pillosu, in a press release. "<em>This marks the beginning of a journey we want to take alongside Starfinder fans everywhere. We can‚Äôt wait to share more about the ragtag crew navigating the Pact Worlds, full of danger and adventure."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>For Paizo's part, publisher and chief creative officer, Erik Mona, added, "<em>Starfinder‚Äôs universe is rich, vast, and beloved</em>. <em>Epictellers Entertainment's vision aligns perfectly with the essence of our galaxy. We believe they‚Äôre the ideal team to bring this next chapter of the franchise to life.</em>"</p>

<p>Afterlight will have you assemble six companions for your journey, each fitting into one of six categories for the turn-based fights: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. You'll travel to multiple locations in the universe and engage in a narrative-focused adventure where the choices you make will impact the outcome of the game.</p>



<p>Another interesting tidbit is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Neil Newbon</a>, the actor who many will know from <a href="https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and most recently from Surgent Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/">Dead Take</a>, is directing the voice cast.</p>



<p>Today's announcement and screenshots have provided a good foundation for what Afterlight could become, but the real test is always the first view of live gameplay. Hopefully, we'll be able to check some gameplay footage before the end of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>RimWorld </i>has come a long way since its initial launch in November of 2013. Back then, a lot of what made the game great today was simple and barebones. Through regular content updates and multiple expansions, the team at Ludeon Studios has crafted one of the greatest story-generating colony sim games in this niche genre. But it‚Äôs the modding community that carries the torch forward. They‚Äôve introduced the community to total overhauls, eyebrow-raising inclusions, and, of course, the ever-beloved quality of life mods. Let‚Äôs explore a few of those that many of us long-time players can‚Äôt do without!</p> <h2>Neat Storage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614367">¬© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / seobungzu</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the earliest rooms you‚Äôll construct for your base‚Äîor, at the very least, that you should construct‚Äîis a storage room for everything you brought in the crash landing. If left outside in the weather and the fauna, your packaged food will quickly deteriorate. But no one wants to walk over junk on the floor, right?</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416243474&amp;searchtext=neat+storage">Neat Storage</a> enables clean, aesthetically pleasing storage solutions for everything from raw resources to clothing to weapons to body parts. The shelves are simply, <i>mwah</i>, gorgeous to look at.</p>

 <h2>Character Editor</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614368">¬© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / VOID</figcaption></figure> <p>You‚Äôll encounter a wide variety of pawns during the creation process, most of which feature an abundance of quirks, high and low skills, passions, and even injuries. It‚Äôs random, and you could very easily get screwed over by the in-game character generator.</p> <p>If you‚Äôd rather have a little more agency over your colony, a tool like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874644848&amp;searchtext=character+editor">Character Editor</a> will allow you to completely resculpt a pawn into anything you desire. From a pyromaniac god-like character with maxed out abilities to a child warrior turned scientist incapable of cleaning or menial labor, it‚Äôs all up to you now!</p>

 <h2>Smarter Construction</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614369">¬© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / Hultis</figcaption></figure> <p>Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, pawns in <i>RimWorld </i>aren‚Äôt the sharpest tools in the shed. Sure, they‚Äôll satiate their basic needs if left to their own devices, but for everything else, you need to take an active hand in ordering them about. If you want something built, it‚Äôs up to your planning expertise. Need a food source, yep, it‚Äôs up to you.</p> <p>Pawns tend to construct entire structures randomly, sometimes leading to roof collapses that wipe out whole colonies or trapping a pawn inside an airless room. With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202185773&amp;searchtext=smarter+construction">Smarter Construction</a>, those mishaps are a thing of the past. They‚Äôll build smart, leaving paths open for trapped pawns, and construct walls and supports in such a way that solidifies the building.</p>

But more often than not, <i>RimWorld </i>devolves into its usual dangerous, destructive planetary war as always.

With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508341791&amp;searchtext=filth+vanishes+with+rain+and+time">Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</a>, the next time those rain clouds appear overhead, they‚Äôll help cleanse the land and leave your settlers feeling content and devoid of dirty, germ-ridden thoughts.</p> <h2>Color Coded Mood Bar</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614371">¬© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / CrashM / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every minor and major incident in the game affects your pawn‚Äôs disposition. From a lack of food to too few recreational devices to a raid to discovering an underground network of tunnels leading to the ultimate bug hive beneath your base, your pawns will either roll with the punches or roll on the floor. But you can‚Äôt take steps to help them overcome such challenges with a clear head if you don‚Äôt understand their mood better.</p>

 <p>Sure, you could just go into the mood tab of their character HUD, but who has time for that? With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006605356">Color Coded Mood Bar</a>, a glance at the top of the screen will tell you everything you need to know.

		<p>Nintendo have announced that the price of the original Switch consoles and accessories will be changing this weekend in the United States. While they do not explicitly state that the price is going to increase, if the price was to be reduced they would be shouting about it, so it‚Äôs easy to read between the lines and this is a price hike.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the text from Nintendo.</p>


<p><em>‚ÄúPricing for the original Nintendo Switch‚Ñ¢ family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.‚Äù</em></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúOther Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>I have been writing video games news for a very long and I think this is the first time a legacy console has had a price increase, rather than a decrease. Some US retailers have already changed their prices, adding $40-$50 to the price of a Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>As for why the prices are being increased, it‚Äôs fairly obvious. The consoles are made outside the US and that means <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cpqvdxzwv22t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tarrifs.</a></p>
<p>The price increase may have little impact as everyone seems to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-huge-new-console-sales-record-in-its-first-month/">buying a Switch 2.&nbsp;</a>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process ‚Äì they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles,</p>

<hr>
<p>Onto hardware now, and it's a pretty familiar picture. The Switch 2 is once again head and shoulders above the competition, despite numbers falling a little since last week. Nintendo's latest put up an additional 92,013 sales this time, with the regional total edging ever closer to the big two milly.</p>
<p>The Switch OLED and Lite models have outsold the PS5 once again, though the numbers pale in comparison to those from the successor as more and more people decide to make the switch to Switch 2.</p>
