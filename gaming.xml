            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216054/intel-msi-asus-bios-updates-crashing-13th-14th-raptor-lake-gen-cpus<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus and MSI have both released beta BIOS updates today to address Intel’s crashing 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake desktop processors. While the BIOS updates won’t fix CPUs that are already damaged, they include Intel’s new microcode update that should help further address the instability issues.</p><p>If it works well, this could be a very big deal for Intel, which lost some of its reputation after its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">flagship chips were found to crash</a> earlier this year and, after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">long investigation</a>, discovered there would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">no true fix</a>, requiring customers to replace any damaged chips. Intel also isn’t having a great year, period, recently announcing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs">layoffs of at least 15,000 workers</a> and stopping “non-essential work.”</p><p>Asus has <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/intel-700-600-series/raptorlake-resources/m-p/1034564/highlight/true#M24284">released its beta BIOS updates</a> through its ROG forums for a variety of Z790 motherboards. These are also typically posted to Asus’ support pages a few days after they’re posted to its ROG forums. MSI’s BIOS updates can be found on the individual motherboard support pages for its motherboards:</p><p>While we wouldn’t normally recommend using a beta BIOS update, given that this addresses an “elevated operating voltages” issue, you might want to go ahead and install these as soon as possible.</p><p>If you use a board other than MSI and Asus, or the microcode BIOS update isn’t available for your particular motherboard right now, make sure you’re on the latest BIOS update either way. Even if they’re missing the latest fix, recent BIOS updates should already include Intel’s recommended power delivery profiles, which could reduce the likelihood of your chip getting damaged.</p><p>“Please help us get the word out to all Raptor Lake desktop users, especially i9 users, in big screaming headlines that they need to update their PC to the latest BIOS now to stop/prevent the CPU wear and hopefully avoid the need for an RMA,” said Falcon Northwest founder Kelt Reeves in an email to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week.</p><p>If you have an Asus board and want to check that your BIOS is set to the right power profile, Falcon Northwest has a good overview we’ve embedded below. The very latest Asus BIOS updates should already default to Intel’s settings instead of the company’s own overclocking profile.</p><p>Intel reportedly said these BIOS updates <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-says-raptor-lake-microcode-update-will-not-affect-overclocking-and-performance-new-arrow-lake-battlemage-updates">shouldn’t cause</a> any performance loss, and reviewers are already gearing up to test Intel’s latest microcode to ensure there are no big changes for its 13th and 14th Gen chips.</p><p>We’re also still waiting on Intel to provide a tool to test existing machines for any processor degradation. Intel has also extended its warranty on a variety of 13th and 14th Gen CPUs by an additional two years. PC makers are largely passing on that warranty extension to consumers, and you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">find out if your own system is covered right here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Vampire Survivors - the acclaimed (and still doggedly vampire-free) minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle - is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 29th August.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors launched into PC early access back in 2021, where it immediately set tongues wagging - partly because it cost an absurdly generous £3.99, but mostly because its mix of wave-based monster dodging and auto-bludgeoning is very blimmin' good indeed.
</p>
<p>
"Once this wave is done, once this boss is done, once I've unlocked a new character or item, I should really turn off the computer and go for a run. Maybe," wrote Christian Donlan in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Recommended review</a>. "Or maybe one more go, one more choice, one more chance to confuse speed with damage with experience."

<p>
Since its early access debut, Vampire Survivors has received a 1.0 release, a heap of free and paid DLC (including collaborations with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-announces-among-us-dlc-collaboration">Among Us</a> and Contra), and it's spread its leathery wings to Xbox, Switch, Android, iOS, and Mac. Oh, and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">won a BAFTA</a>. So while PlayStation is definitely a little late to the party, it remains, at least, a party worth attending.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors' PlayStation release will include all free content released so far - adding up to over 40 playable characters and 80 weapons – and all four of its paid DLCs (Legacy of Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meetings, and Operation Guns) will be available for purchase on PS5 and PS4 at launch.
</p>
<p>
Expect Vampire Survivors to cost £3.99/€4.99/$4.99 when it <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010458/">comes to PS4 and PS5</a> on 29th August, with its paid DLC priced at £1.59/€1.99/$1.99.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Enshrouded first went into Early Access in January 2024, and since then, it has been incredibly successful. Developed and published by Keen Games GmbH, this is the second game they created, with Portal Knights being their first. Since its release in January, it has reached over 30 million players, and the number is continuing to rise.</p>
<p><a href="https://enshrouded.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enshrouded</a> is a game worth the price tag, as there is much content for an Early Access game. There have been three major updates, all of which have added new features. In addition, it has seen 14 patches and 16 hotfixes, with the developers consistently working to ensure the game remains in its best possible state for players to get stuck into.</p>
<p>Considering the game has only been out since January, there is much content and fixes for players to explore. They are not even close to done with the planned content, as they have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-2024-early-access-roadmap-full-release-2025/">full roadmap</a> ahead of them. While most of their planned content is for 2025 and beyond, 2024 has already seen some major updates.</p>
<p>These updates include the instanced dungeons called the Hallowed Halls, which players can take on alone or in a group. Later this year, they will be adding Water to the game. While there is already Water you can drink, there is no form of flowing water or bodies of water to be found. Instead, it is just lava.</p>
<p>Upcoming updates include World Events and the ability to visit other players' bases. Looking ahead to 2024, Enshrouded has planned updates, such as a Weather System, new enemies and bosses, and enemy patrols.</p>
<p>Since its release in January, over 90 million hours of Enshrouded has been played, with nearly 150 million player deaths. Additionally, almost 700,000 players have reached the maximum level of level 25.</p>
<p>With Enshrouded's release in January, Keen Games GmbH has doubled in size. The longest-serving member of the team has worked there for 19 years, and the latest member joined in August to help bolster the QA.</p>
<p>This company takes its players' feedback seriously, with players able to suggest new items or events on the Enshrouded Feature Board. This has helped the company choose what to put on its roadmap, and some of the most voted-for features, such as the Hallowed Halls, have already made it into the game.</p>
<p>Keen Games GmbH hopes to have a full release of Enshrouded on PC in 2025, with the game also coming to consoles that year. So far, Enshrouded maintains a Very Positive overall review on Steam, and is continuing to rise in popularity.</p>

Four years later, Arkane would up the ante with <em>Dishonored 2</em>, an exceptional sequel that improves upon its predecessor in every possible way. If the first game was a proof of concept, <em>Dishonored 2</em> is that concept executed to perfection. <em>Dishonored </em>thrives when it lets you lose in a large sandbox with a set of tools to navigate challenges in any way you can think of. That freedom existed in the first game, with wonderful levels with multiple solutions, but <em>Dishonored 2</em> builds on that even more. </p><p>It begins with the dual protagonist set up of the sequel. In <em>Dishonored 2</em>, you can choose between playing as Corvo, the protagonist of the first game, or Emily Kaldwin, the now grown-up empress we saved when she was a kid in <em>Dishonored</em>. Each has a unique set of powers that unlock over the course of the game. While Corvo and Emily’s skills have a similar utility—both have abilities that allow for quickly traversing long distances, for example—no two skills are exactly the same. This means that you might find a completely unique solution to problems as Corvo that Emily can’t exactly replicate. Just by offering you this choice, the potential paths through every level in <em>Dishonored 2</em> become exponentially greater. It makes<em> </em>this agame about experimentation, improvisation, and learning to master your abilities to test the limits of the game’s design.</p><p>If you’ve only seen one thing about <em>Dishonored 2</em>, it is most likely the iconic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-closer-look-at-dishonored-2-s-clockwork-mansion-1789429571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-closer-look-at-dishonored-2-s-clockwork-mansion-1789429571">Clockwork Mansion</a></span>,a level set within an eccentric inventor’s home, which has been rigged with endless secret rooms, shifting walls, automaton enemies, and more. The lobby of the building is just one breathtaking moment you’ll encounter in it, as you can hit switches to unfurl different staircases that offer different starting paths through the mansion’s maze. If you are fast enough, you can even find yourself moving through the extensive series of tunnels and passages behind the walls and under the mansion’s foundation, unlocking an entire second layer to the level. </p><p>Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Clockwork Mansion is how early in <em>Dishonored 2</em> it occurs. As one of the first few missions you undertake, it’s a high bar that every subsequent level somehow continues to raise even further. Later levels add even more fascinating permutations for you to play with, like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-made-dishonored-2s-time-travel-level-so-good-1819596566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-made-dishonored-2s-time-travel-level-so-good-1819596566">time-traveling mission</a></span> that lets you move between a single space in both the past and present with your actions changing each timeline. To this day, you can still find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StealthGamerBR2/status/1816457333184016430&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StealthGamerBR2/status/1816457333184016430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new paths</a></span> through levels or other unexpected ways the game’s systems interact because there are just that many possibilities. Every part of <em>Dishonored 2</em> is a showcase of just how impressive Arkane’s grasp on the immersive sim is. If WolfEye’s next game has a fraction of <em>Dishonored 2</em>’s greatness, there is still a good chance it will be excellent.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it seems like a bug or other issue has actually made exotic class items harder to get. Players immediately noticed that Overthrow, an activity on the expansion’s new Pale Heart destination and the most popular way to farm class items, was not dishing out any additional drops. The likelihood of a drop was supposed to be going up more with each completion. Instead, it seemed to have ground to halt.</p><p>“I spent more than 2 hours and 3 full overthrow runs and did NOT get a drop,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1em70gn/exotic_class_item_farm_is_way_worse_then_before/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1em70gn/exotic_class_item_farm_is_way_worse_then_before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player in a popular thread on the Destiny subreddit. “I just KNEW when they announced the changes that it was gonna be worse. At least revert back to the old way PLEASE BUNGIE. And actually fucking BUFF the drop rates instead of NERF them. Smfh...” Another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1elqkqv/3_overthrows_for_1_exotic_class_item_this_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1elqkqv/3_overthrows_for_1_exotic_class_item_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>, “3 Overthrows for 1 Exotic Class Item, this is absurd.” </p><p>The other main way to obtain exotic class item drops is from the Dual Destiny exotic mission. At least one is guaranteed on the first completion each week, but it can otherwise be a long and tedious affair to keep grinding. Unfortunately, the new surprise nerf means that this suboptimal method is now the defacto best way to farm this specific type of loot.</p><p>“We’ve identified an issue impacting Exotic Class Item drop rates,” Bungie confirmed on August 7. “At this time, Tier 4 Overthrow Chests are not contributing to increased drop chances, nor can Exotic Class Items be awarded through them. We’re currently developing a fix, aiming for a near-term hotfix.  We are also looking into giving players a way to chase specific perks in a future update. More details as plans solidify.”</p><p>Players weren’t too forgiving. “So I WASN’T going crazy after 5 hours and only getting 2 drops,” one of them wrote back. Other <em>Destiny 2</em> fans feel the exotic class item situation, which is a core draw of the post-<em>Final Shape</em> end-game at the moment, needs more urgent attention. Some want the item to become craftable, while others just want Bungie to turn on the loot spigot and let them rain down on players. </p><p>That’s in part because morale in the community is in tatters after the latest round of deep cuts at Bungie and reporting that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404"><em>Destiny 2</em> is moving away from big expansions</a></span> with no fresh sequel coming anytime soon. The sci-fi MMO shooter’s future has never felt more up in the air, and it’s been a real whiplash moment for fans still coming off the high of the expansion that successfully wrapped up 10-years of live service storytelling. It’ll take more than just a new This Week At Bungie roundup to repair that trust, but fixing the exotic class item debacle would be a start. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>let's change to Mindscape, a team with experience on projects such as Bluey: The Video Game, Disney Dreamlight Valley, and more, has announced a collaboration with renowned child author Dav Pilkey on a Dog Man video game adaptation called Dog Man: Mission Impawsible.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a press release, the upcoming game will be a 2D side-scrolling platformer featuring various puzzles. It will also feature "50 unique levels" in five different worlds. Players will be able to explore locations from the books, such as City Hall, the Giant Marshmallow Factory, and others. The story will follow Dog Man pursuing a thief who stole the keys to the city.</p><p dir="ltr">Dav Pilkey has worked on various children's books, which include the Captain Underpants series, Dragon, Dumb Bunnies, Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot series, and more. Interestingly enough, Dog Man first appeared in Captain Underpants, but once the series ended, Dog Man became a spin-off series spawning several popular sequels. Dog Man tells of a person who has the head of a dog but the body of a human police officer who goes around stopping various crimes and saving the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347120-screen_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4347120" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347120-screen_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4347120"></a><figcaption>Dog Man in action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347120-screen_1.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347121-screen_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347122-screen_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347123-screen_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347124-screen_5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4347121,1300-4347122,1300-4347123,1300-4347124" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347121-screen_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347122-screen_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347123-screen_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347124-screen_5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347121-screen_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347122-screen_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347123-screen_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347124-screen_5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As of writing, Dog Man: Mission Impawsible doesn't have a release date, but it's set to launch on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Destiny 2 fans are still reeling from the news that developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">Bungie laid off</a> around 220 people in July, or roughly 17% of its workforce. Speaking on an earnings call, Sony president Hiroki Totoki discussed the Destiny studio's restructure in greater detail, stating that it came from a desire to "optimize overall studio structure."</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://x.com/nib95_/status/1821437772038590691" rel="nofollow ">a report</a> of the call posted to social media, Totoki said that the back-office functions of Bungie will be integrated into other Sony studios, and that the studio's resources will be focused on Destiny 2 and the Marathon reboot. His comments would seem to indicate that Sony is taking a more-active role in the studio's direction, making it a more-integrated part of the existing constellation of SIE studios.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 | The Journey Ahead</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time that Totoki has expressed a desire to see improvement from Bungie. Back in February, he said during a financial-results call (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-president-wants-bungie-to-be-better-at-assuming-accountability-for-development-timelines/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>) that while he was impressed with Bungie's creativity and knowledge of live service, he felt that the company needed to improve some areas of its business, including "use of business expenses" and "accountability for development timelines."</p><p dir="ltr">The timing of the large Bungie layoffs surprised many in the industry, especially since the studio had just shipped The Final Shape, its best-received content pack for Destiny 2 in many years. However, reports from Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/" rel="nofollow ">Game Fille newsletter</a> and elsewhere claim that the circumstances of The Final Shape's release were largely irrelevant to the decision, due to Bungie missing Sony's financial targets since at least 2023. Several senior execs at Bungie were affected by those layoffs, including Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy; Bungie mentioned in its blog post announcing the departures that "most" of its senior staff were being let go. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-destiny-game-codenamed-payback-has-reportedly-been-cancelled/1100-6525485/">Bloomberg report</a> suggests that the next Destiny game, codenamed Payback, was also canceled a while ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. had its earnings call yesterday, where it revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming revenue is down 41%</a> and <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/warner-bros-discovery-massive-write-down-after-losing-nba-package-1236033756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things aren’t looking good</a> in other parts of its sprawling business either. I’ll admit to feeling a bit of petty glee at this news: seeing David Zaslav, a man who seems to <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/rooster-teeth-shut-down-warner-brothers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything</a> his company makes, reap the consequences of his actions feels a little good, even if those consequences are, for him, stock price drops. For the rest of us, they could be more <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enshittification</a> and slop.</p><p>On the gaming side, some of this revenue drop can be blamed on the failure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a> when held against the–sigh–success of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/01/23/hogwarts-legacy-jk-rowling-trans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a>. Back in <a href="https://aftermath.site/give-me-janky-mid-tier-games-over-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March</a>, gaming head JB Perrette felt the way forward after <em>Suicide Squad</em> was <em>more</em> live service, leaning into the WB conglomerate of properties to make forever games off of. On yesterday’s call, that still appears to be the plan, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perrette saying</a>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We know that our franchises, particularly in a world where the gaming industry-launching brand new franchises is getting harder and harder for a number of reasons, including <a href="https://www.epsilon.com/us/insights/idfa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IDFA deprecation</a> and more challenges with marketing and customer acquisition. And that franchises like the ones that we have are in high demand, and can help in launching games.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Perrette said that “one of the areas we are particularly leaning into, which is about half of the $200 billion games business, is the free-to-play space,” as evidenced by WB’s <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-studio-player-first-games-1236080155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase of <em>MultiVersus</em> developer Player First last month</a>. So buckle up for microtransactions, I guess.</p><p>Zaslav, meanwhile, said something that fills me with such dread that I’ll drop the whole quote here, with added emphasis, and then break it down:</p><blockquote><p>One of the strategic advantages of owning all our IP is, as the world has changed, it used to be you launch a movie or you launch a TV series, then you do a game. <strong>But one of the reasons that </strong><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></strong><strong> was so successful and the #1 game last year, you went to </strong><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></strong><strong> and you entered the game and you were able to become part of that world.</strong> That ultimately I think is a big piece of where this industry is going.<strong> That we'll create a movie, whether it's Batman or Superman or Harry Potter, and maybe there'll be a TV show, but the ability to go in that world and have that experience of spending time with all the characters is something that we still own.</strong> We have 11 studios here, and we have a lot of IP.<strong> And there's also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at. Because as JB said, we need to get bigger</strong>, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>There’s no denying the appeal of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> was primarily that if you can somehow still stomach <em>Harry Potter</em> despite <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/04/03/what-has-jk-rowling-said-about-transgender-people-trans-views-tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JK Rowling</a>, you got to play a game in a world you recognize. <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I’ve written before</a>, that dopamine hit of recognition is one of the only two values the owners of these properties get from owning them (the other is money), so it’s no wonder they think it’s what the rest of us want from them too.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing Zaslav seems to be saying here is that WB’s movies and tv shows could be games, and vice versa. There’s no better example of this, for me, than WB-owned HBO’s <em>The Last of Us, </em>which showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48WJNnNefvI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trailer for its second season</a> last weekend. That series, an original idea in 2013 when the first game premiered, has become some kind of weird ouroboros: a game that felt like a movie becoming a tv show that looks just like the game, surrounded by multiple remasters of itself. It gets gamers into HBO, and HBO viewers into games, and if you were Zaslav and Perrette, with a stable of both movie and game studios at your disposal, of course you’d fall in love with how much value you could squeeze out of something without actually, essentially, creating anything new.&nbsp;</p><p>But Zaslav is also saying that, not only could WB squeeze its properties for everything they’re worth, but it could license them out to other companies too. So not only could WB pump out more movie tie-in games or game tie-in movies and shows, but <em>other </em>game studios, equally desperate, could start doing that too. And while I don’t necessarily fault any game studio looking to up their chances for a hit in these shaky times, I’m not sure spending a ton of money to license an IP is the first solution I’d look to when considering <a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballooning AAA costs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We're already seeing this happening in games. I might be one of the few people in the world who booed when Arkane Lyon <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/marvels-blade-reveal#:~:text=Arkane%20Studios%20has%20revealed%20Marvel's%20Blade%20at%20The%20Game%20Awards%202023." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> its <em>Blade</em> game in 2023; a studio who does things as risky and interesting as <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Dishonored</em> making a Marvel game felt disappointing to me, even if I’m sure they’ll do a good job with a world I will cop to having zero interest in. Truth be told, I feel the same about <em>Hitman</em> developer IOI’s delve into <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond</a>, or <em>Wolfenstein</em> developer MachineGames’ upcoming take on <a href="https://aftermath.site/whose-mouth-is-this" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>. I don’t <em>want</em> these studios hampered by existing fandoms and a bible full of rules about how they’re allowed to portray famous characters or well-trod lore. I want to be in IOI’s world, or MachineGames’, or Arkane’s, not Marvel’s or George Lucas’. I want these studios to be <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uniquely</a> themselves, not at the service of existing culture. </p><p>But the end of Zaslav’s quote hits the nail on the head: “we need to get bigger, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of.” He doesn’t mean “take advantage of” in the colloquial sense, but he doesn’t <em>not</em> mean it either. At the end of the day, all of this is just about growth for shareholders, and companies like WB are, as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed Zitron</a> describes them, simply “nihilistic engines for growth, anti-companies that create value by reducing what they contribute to the world.” The Zaslavian future will include games, sure, but not <em>new</em> ones; instead, we could see more games but less substance, more iterations on the same old things whose main purpose is just to put more money in men like Zaslav’s pockets.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-arkane-devs-reveal-new-first-person-action-rpg.948213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfeye-ex-arkane-new-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Weird West&nbsp;</em>developer Wolfeye Studios, which was founded by a number of ex-Arkane developers, has announced that its next project will be a first-person action RPG with a sci-fi vibe.</p>
<p>In a press release, the studio, which is led by Arkane founder&nbsp;Raphaël Colantonio, says that it's "just wrapped pre-production" on its newest project. This means the game, which currently remains nameless, is now "full steam ahead in production".</p>
<p>Prior to release (whenever that happens to be), Wolfeye says it will run an "exclusive and limited private alpha" for the game in order to gauge players' reactions and shape the development process with community feedback. The studio has also shared a first look at some artwork for the upcoming action RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ex-arkane-wolfeye-sci-fi-action-rpg.jpg?itok=n7R81aIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ex-arkane-wolfeye-sci-fi-action-rpg.jpg?itok=qW7uaQPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wolfeye's new sci-fi game looks pretty imposing.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Colantonio says he's confident that fans of&nbsp;<em>Dishonored&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Prey&nbsp;</em>will "feel at home", as will "fans of RPGs in general".</p>
<p>The untitled game does not yet have a publishing partner, but Colantonio says the studio is searching for one, and that the limited private alpha for the game will happen sometime next year.</p>
<p>If you're interested in participating, you can sign up for it <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Wolfeye's official website</a>, where you'll also find some rather evocative-looking artwork bearing the logo of a fictional company called "Candis Technologies".</p>
<p>Whatever this project turns out to be, it'll be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wild-looking-weird-west-is-wolfeye-studios-debut-title">second game developed by Wolfeye</a> after 2022's&nbsp;<em>Weird West</em>, which was an isometric action RPG that saw players taking control of five distinct characters rather than creating their own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfeye-studios-weird-west_0.jpg?itok=hoAxdm9p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfeye-studios-weird-west_0.jpg?itok=2rE8M1UO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Weird West&nbsp;</em>was Wolfeye's first game.</figcaption></figure><p>As a first effort,&nbsp;<em>Weird West&nbsp;</em>was impressively ambitious, but I have to admit I found it lacking in character and spread a bit too thin, so I'm seriously hoping Wolfeye can step it up for its second game.</p>
<p>At any rate, it's nice to see ex-Arkane devs being given another chance. Perhaps if this game is successful, Wolfeye could poach some of the folks left jobless after Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">closure of Arkane Austin</a>, although there might be a bit of a geography problem in that regard. Only time will tell.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-early-pc-better-ambient-occlusion/">God of War Ragnarok</a> PC system requirements have been revealed today, and they are not particularly demanding compared to other games released this year.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game will require at least an Intel i5-4670k or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX 1060 or AMD RX 5500 XT GPU and 8 GB RAM to run at native 1080p resolution, 30 FPS average, and low settings. Running the game at higher resolutions and better framerates will be more demanding, although the requirements for native 4K resolution at 60 frames per second look reasonable, as users will need an Intel i5-11600K or<br>
AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU, NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti or AMD RX 7900 XT GPU, and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>On the Official PlayStation Blog, Sony also confirmed once again that God of War Ragnarok will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XeSS 1.3, as well as both DLSS and FSR frame generation technologies to achieve higher framerates.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok launches on PC on September 19th. It is also available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.</p>

So there was a lot of hype surrounding EA’s new <em>College Football 25.</em> After a decade of modding and hacking those older versions of the game to keep them updated with new players and teams, we now have a big new college football sim to enjoy. And many are enjoying it, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253"><em>EA College Football 25</em> hitting over 713,000</a></span> players during the game’s early access launch on console. </p><p>For the most part, players and critics have been pretty positive about the new game, but nothing is perfect, so EA has released its second large update for College Football 25.

Still, it also retains a lot of familiar gameplay mechanics and concepts that ensure if you played the previous games, you’ll feel right at home. Whether you’re a returning player well-versed in <em>Cat Quest</em>’s history, or you’re brand new to the franchise, we’ve compiled a solid list of tips to help you get started in this feline-focused adventure.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196773" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196773,196742,195150" data-current="196773"><div><p>This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22330.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h3878"><a id=""></a><strong>Visit Lovepurr Castle ASAP for Healpaw Spell</strong></h2><p>Previously, gaining spells was just about buying them from a mysterious cavern. But this time out, there can sometimes be more to it. For instance, there are three missing Lovepurr Chronicle books, and you’ll want to find them. As soon as you obtain your first Lovepurr Chronicle, head over to Lovepurr Islands on the northeastern side of the map and speak to Clawford inside Lovepurr Castle. He’ll be so elated to see that you’ve brought one of the three missing books back to him that he’ll grant you the Healpaw spell. This powerful healing spell is an invaluable tool you should keep equipped at all times.</p><p>Note: If you haven’t found any Lovepurr Chronicles books yet, you can snag one in Lovepurr Cave directly north of Lovepurr Castle.

However, since some of the game’s opening battles aren’t terribly difficult, it’s a good idea to play and explore for a few hours before investing many of your hard-earned coins in upgrades. This gives you time to discover new gear that may appeal to you far more than some of the earliest choices.</p><h2 id="h3880"><a id=""></a><strong>Synergize! Synergize! Synergize!</strong></h2><p>Speaking of gear, there are plenty of weapons, pieces of armor, accessories, and spells in <em>Cat Quest III</em>, and you’re obviously free to mix and match them any way you’d like. However, if you want to become an ultimate powerhouse, you’ll want to equip synergetic items.</p><p>For instance, if you find that you’re enjoying being an agile and aggressive melee-based combatant, grab a fast weapon (such as a set of claws) and combine them with armor and accessories which boost your attack speed or power. Similarly, you can combine gear designed for specific types of magic to become a powerful sorcerer of sorts. Play around with what works best for you and go all in!</p><figure id="" data-id="7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-recommend-id="image://7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cannon power menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cannon power menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-recommend-id="image://7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cannon power menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3881"><a id=""></a><strong>Check the accessory and ship menus every 5 to 10 levels</strong></h2><p>New levels come at a brisk pace in <em>Cat Quest III</em>, and reaching milestones brings expansion slots for your accessories and ship blueprints. As such, every time you reach a new level that is a multiple of five, head into the menu and check to see if you’ve unlocked any fresh slots to equip an accessory or ship upgrade, so that you’re always getting the most out of what the game has to offer.</p><h2 id="h3882"><a id=""></a><strong>If you’re stuck, Lightmouse has you covered</strong></h2><p>In addition to <em>Cat Quest III</em>’s various star-topped obelisks that point you in the direction of your next main objective, there’s someone helpful hanging out in the lighthouse in Pawt Purvanna. They go by the name “Lightmouse”, and they’ll happily give you insight into what you should be doing to progress, as well as offer up some useful tips about gameplay. If you’re ever feeling stuck, give Lightmouse a visit to see if they can give you a hand.</p><hr><p>There’s no shortage of content to see in <em>Cat Quest III</em>’s 10 to 15 hours of feline pirate-themed gameplay, and we hope these tips gave you a head-start on your adventure. Now go hop in your ship and take to the high seas!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>As mentioned, a new physical edition has also been announced: the <em>Final Fantasy I-vi Collection Anniversary Edition</em>! It’s coming to PlayStation 4 and Switch October 8, 2024, and includes a sticker sheet featuring some familiar <em>Final Fantasy</em> figures!</p><p><strong>What features are included in the games?</strong></p><p>The pixel remaster versions of these classic games have some awesome features that make them even more enjoyable to play than before.</p><p>These include the option to:</p><ul><li><strong>Change Soundtracks</strong> – The <em>Pixel Remaster</em> series features utterly superb new orchestral arrangements of F<em>Final Fantasy I</em> to <em>VI</em>‘s soundtracks. However, we know some of you may want to recreate the original experience of playing these games, so you’ll be able to switch between the original and rearranged soundtracks.</li><li><strong>Change Fonts</strong> – The console release of <em>Final Fantasy I</em> to <em>VI</em> gives you the option to switch between two different fonts: the default font and a new pixel-based font that recreates the feel of the original games.</li><li><strong>Turn Off Random Encounters</strong> – Sometimes you just want to explore in peace, so a feature in the <em>Pixel Remaster</em> games lets you turn off random encounters completely. This means you can roam the world without being harassed by monsters. That also means you won’t get stronger, so be careful how you use it…</li><li><strong>Adjust <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Speaking of getting stronger, want to speed things up a little? Boost features let you adjust the experience gained by up to four times. Perfect if you want an easier run through the games.</li><li><strong>Auto-Battle</strong> – With a press of a button, you can make characters automatically perform their last <a title="Genres > Action [2,057 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>. It makes battles fly by!</li><li><strong>View Extras</strong> – Get a closer look at the many monsters you’ll face in the bestiary, marvel at the beautiful illustrations in a gallery, and enjoy the incredible soundtracks in a music player.</li></ul><p>All these features are, of course, optional, but they mean that players of all types—from those who played the originals to those who have never played a classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> game before—can have a great time with these six awesome <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,654 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.</p><p><strong>What games are part of <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> series?</strong></p><p>For those who haven’t experienced these incredible games on PC and mobile, the FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series comprises <em>Final Fantasy I</em> through <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, giving fans a chance to relive some of the most beloved <a title="Genres > RPG [16,477 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> of all time in a way that perfectly captures the spirit of those original games.</p><p>But if anything, we’re even more excited for new fans who’ll get to experience them for the very first time. These games are true masterpieces, and the Final <em>Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> series offers the best way to play them yet!</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the games in the series.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy</em></strong> – This is the ironically named game that started it all. You take control of the Warriors of Light, off on a journey to defeat four fiends and restore peace to the world. So many of the elements of the series that we’ve come to know and love make their debut right here in this very first entry: a massive world full of mystery, some iconic monster designs and that incredible music.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy II</em></strong> – The second game in the series introduces a new world, new characters and something that would become a trademark of the series: innovation. The story focuses on the conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance. A small group of heroes is all that stands between the world and ruin. <em>Final Fantasy II</em> demonstrates the developers’ willingness to push their boundaries and try new things. For example, rather than sticking to the predictable, the game features a proficiency system in which characters skill with weapons and abilities increase the more they used them. Fun fact: this is the <em>Final Fantasy</em> game that introduced the world to chocobos! Now that’s a legacy.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy III</em></strong> – When darkness falls and the land is robbed of light, four young heroes are chosen by the crystals to head off an exciting journey across a vast and hostile land. This critically-acclaimed entry in the series innovated with a flexible job system, which lets characters change their roles in combat at any time. Many of the most famous elements of <em>Final Fantasy</em> started here too—for example, it was the first to introduce summons, including series mainstays Bahamut and Shiva!</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy IV</em></strong> – <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> delivers one of the richest and most powerful stories in the series. It’s filled with characters and scenarios that fans continue to love to this day. It focuses on the dark knight Cecil, who finds himself stripped of his position and rank when he questions his king’s increasingly troubling orders. When he’s sent on a simple delivery mission with his friend Kain, the shocking events that follow send him and a group of allies on an incredible journey of betrayal, love and redemption. This is the first game to feature the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which combines turn-based and real-time elements to create fast-paced and strategic combat.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy V</em></strong> – The world of <em>Final Fantasy V</em> is on the verge of destruction because the elemental crystals that bring life and prosperity to the lands have lost their power. The only hope lies in four heroes: Bartz, Princess Lenna of Castle Tycoon, pirate Faris and the mysterious Galuf. Driven together by fate, they set off on a quest that to save the planet itself. As well as refining the ATB system, <em>Final Fantasy V</em> expands your strategic options massively through a greatly expanded job system, which let you customize your characters with 22 different jobs.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong> – <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> is a game that’s beloved by fans and critics alike. That’s partly thanks to its incredible setting and story. It’s set in a land where magic has disappeared, and humanity has instead turned to iron, gunpowder, steam and other technology. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that magic is mostly gone – a young woman enslaved by the evil Empire still has the power. When she encounters a powerful ancient being called an Esper, she sets off a chain of events that will have epic and terrible consequences.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has revealed plans to license its IP out, given the high interest from third-party developers, as well as the success of games like Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>On a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investors call,</a> Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said, "We have 11 studios here, and we have a lot of IP. And there's also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at."</p><p>He continued, "Because as [president of global streaming and games JB Perrette] said, we need to get bigger, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of." Zaslav explained that the success of Hogwarts Legacy was because players were able to immerse themselves into the world, and now Zaslav wants to make video games more of a priority.</p><p>Perrette also noted on the call that Warner Bros. is looking to grow in the free-to-play gaming business in order to balance out the cyclical and more hits-based nature of premium console and PC games. As part of that initiative, that's why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/following-game-relaunch-multiversus-developer-now-has-a-new-owner/1100-6525200/" data-ref-id="1100-6525200">Warner Bros. acquired Player First</a>, the developer behind the free-to-play game MultiVersus.</p><p>The cyclicality can be seen by Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's underperformance, which caused Warner Bros.' gaming revenue to <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q2/earnings-result/WBD-2Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decrease by 41%</a> when compared to last year, which saw the release of Hogwarts Legacy's.

That includes <em>Legacy of the Moonspell</em>, <em>Tides of the Foscari</em>, <em>Emergency Meeting</em>, and April’s <em>Operation Guns </em>which added a <em>Contra </em>crossover. The base game is $5 and all of the DLC combined is an additional $9. Plus there are all of the free updates that have added all sorts of other characters and easter eggs. </p><p>Why did it take this long? Poncle, a tiny indie team, has been taking its time with ports, working on one console a year. While Microsoft was on the ball with an Xbox version shortly after the 2022 PC release, Vampire Survivors didn’t come to Nintendo Switch until a year later, with a fantastic free mobile version taking precedence early on. Poncle blamed the more recent holdup on Sony’s submission process, noting that the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had never put a game on the PlayStation store before</a></span>.</p><p>In the meantime, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> has spawned dozens of worthy clones, copycats, and clever adaptations.

Like <em>Slay the Spire </em>before it, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> seems to hit on something archetypal that elevates its mashup of mechanics into its own subgenre.</p><p>It’s nice that PlayStation owners will finally be able to see what all the fuss is about. And also, I can’t wait to burn another hundred hours chasing that Platinum trophy. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We've got you; here's a simple guide to help you get started on your epic journey. </p><p>Begin by grasping the game's fundamental concepts and gathering the essential materials. Once you understand the core mechanics, you can dive into character creation and start playing with a group of friends. Here's how to get started:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Understand the Basics</strong>: D&amp;D is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) in which players create characters and embark on adventures in a fantasy world. The game is typically played with a Dungeon Master (DM) who narrates the story and controls the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters.</li><li><strong>Get the Core Rulebooks</strong>: You'll need the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0PDE5?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u><em>Player's Handbook</em></u><u>, </u><u><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></u><u>, and </u><u><em>Monster Manual</em></u><u>.</u></a> These books provide all the rules and lore necessary to create characters, run adventures, and understand the game's mechanics.</li><li><strong>Join a Group</strong>: Find a group of friends who are interested in playing or joining an existing group. If you need help finding a local group, online platforms like <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roll20</u></a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord </u></a>can help you connect with other players.</li><li><strong>Create Your Character</strong>: Use the <em>Player's Handbook</em> to create your first character. Think of the Player's race, class, background, and personality. This is your chance to get creative and make someone you'd enjoy playing.</li><li><strong>Start With a Simple Adventure</strong>: Beginners should start with a pre-written adventure. <em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> is an excellent choice for new players and DMs. It offers a balanced introduction to D&amp;D gameplay and storytelling.</li></ol><h3><strong>Choosing the Right Miniatures</strong></h3><p>Miniatures add a visual and tactile element to D&amp;D, making battles and encounters more immersive.

Understanding these modes can help you decide which type suits your group best. Here are some standard game modes:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Campaign Play</strong> is the traditional mode in which players embark on a long-term adventure, progressing their characters over many sessions. It requires a consistent group and a dedicated DM to manage the story and progression.</li><li><strong>One-Shots</strong>: These are single-session adventures that can be completed in a few hours. They are great for introducing new players to the game or playing when a regular campaign session is impossible.</li><li><strong>Skirmishes</strong>: These combat-focused sessions emphasize tactical battles rather than stories. Players can quickly set up scenarios and engage in fighting, making them a good choice for those who enjoy the combat mechanics of D&amp;D.</li><li><strong>West Marches</strong> is a style of play in which multiple DMs and a large pool of players participate in a shared world. Sessions are player-driven, and the world evolves based on the actions and discoveries of different groups.</li><li><strong>Solo Play</strong>: While D&amp;D is typically a group game, solo adventures and modules are available for players who want to experience the game independently.</li></ol><h3><strong>Final Tips</strong></h3><p>Getting into D&amp;D is more than just the game; it's about spending time with the community, sharing stories, and having fun. Start small, engage with others, and most importantly, enjoy the process. The journey is as much about the experiences and memories you create along the way as about the adventures your character embarks on. Here are some final tips to help you along:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Start Small</strong>: You don't need to buy anything all at once. Begin with the essentials and gradually expand your collection.</li><li><strong>Join Online Communities</strong>: Engage with other D&amp;D enthusiasts on forums such as <a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Myth Weavers</u></a>, social media, and websites like<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> D&amp;D Beyond</u></a>. These communities are great for tips, inspiration, and support.</li><li><strong>Have Fun</strong>: Remember, D&amp;D is about storytelling, creativity, and having fun with friends. Don't stress too much about the rules or perfection—just enjoy the adventure!</li></ul></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 8, 2024 1:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Weird West's five dark-fantasy adventures contain a wagonload of bizarre encounters, twists, and reveals, and its stealth and chaotic combat are challenging but come with the built-in safety nets of unlimited slow-motion and an old-school quickload system," we said.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
