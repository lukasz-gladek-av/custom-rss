<p>In February 2025, Electronic Arts divulged the future of the Battlefield franchise alongside a reveal of ‘Battlefield Labs’. This all-new testing initiative promised to invite fans into the fold to have them trial Battlefield products long before they are released to the open market.</p>



<p>It was also when we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our first look at Battlefield 6</a> – or whatever it’ll end up being named. It got me thinking about the games that came before, more particularly <strong>Battlefield 5, </strong>which I often consider to be the last <strong>good </strong>Battlefield game. </p>



<p>Don’t hate me.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s what I think Battlefield <strong>6 </strong>should take from Battlefield <strong>5</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-battlefield-6-need-to-have">What Does Battlefield 6 Need To Have?</h2>



<p>There are many features and mechanics unique to Battlefield 5 (or defined by Battlefield 5) that I feel would be right at home in Battlefield 6 – not that the title or numbering has been confirmed, of course.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-royale">Battle Royale</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let’s get that controversial one out of the way right off the bat. I think Firestorm was a fantastic addition to Battlefield 5 but it was underappreciated and poorly utilised. It dropped in May 2019, just months after Respawn Entertainment released Apex Legends and around a year before Call of Duty Warzone hit the market.</p>



<p>It was a tough time for the competition in the battle royale space, but Firestorm had potential – and guess who developed it? Criterion Games, in conjunction with EA’s DICE. Both of these studios are working on the next Battlefield game, and the rumours are that Battlefield 6 <strong>will feature </strong>a battle royale.</p>







<h3 id="h-destruction-mechanics">Destruction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5’s destruction mechanics were monumental, and through artillery, missiles, bombs, tanks, planes, and everything else in between, users could raze the entire map to the ground. Entire villages would fall under the weight of devastating explosions, tanks could crawl through buildings, and even now, the sound of a V2 bomb buzzing over fills me with impending dread.</p>



<p>There was a huge backstep in Battlefield 2042 that stripped almost every ounce of destruction from the game. It was a defining feature of the Battlefield franchise, and it was last done best in Battlefield 5. From what we saw in the first pre-alpha trailer for Battlefield 6, the game <strong>will feature </strong>intense destruction mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-con-struction-mechanics"><em>Con</em>struction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a fantastic ability written almost into the background of Battlefield 5, and it allows players to whip out a toolbox and start building defences around their objectives. It’s a neat little feature that adds extra immersion to an already immersive title, and it allows players to get a little more strategic when defending a flag or a building.</p>



<p>It’s a basic thing – players can click or hold a button to lay down sandbags, dig trenches, reinforce windows, set up tank traps, or roll out walls of razor wire. It can turn a simple farmhouse into a well-defended objective in just a few minutes, and I believe that if expanded upon, it could be a fantastic returning feature in Battlefield 6.</p>







<h3 id="h-multi-dimensional-campaign">Multi-Dimensional Campaign</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5 was the last game in the series to have a core campaign, which was built around the typical model – various theatres of war around the world during a major conflict. Battlefield 5’s campaign was cinematic and emotional, and it revealed some of the more ‘secret stories’ of the Second World War, much like Battlefield 1 exposed subtones present in World War I. </p>



<p>When Battlefield 2042 debuted without a campaign, many millions of players believed the game was nursing a gigantic hole front and centre. It has been promised that Battlefield 6 will have a solid campaign like the one of days gone by, but the proof will be in the pudding.</p>







<h3 id="h-another-realistic-theatre-of-war">Another Realistic Theatre of War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It wasn’t just the campaign that was gritty and raw – it was the entire war itself. From map to map, players experienced the brutality and totality of the Second World War, travelling from Africa to France and from Norway to Japan. In Battlefield 2042, the lack of ‘realism’ was an issue, as up until that point, Battlefield had more or less become synonymous with the realistic portrayal of war.</p>



<p>With the introduction of robot dogs, fantastical wing suits, instant zip-lines, and all manner of futuristic technology, Battlefield 2042 – for a while – didn’t feel like Battlefield at all. If Battlefield 6 is going to succeed, I’d like to suggest that it’ll be because it’s rooted in realism, whether that be modern combat or another revisiting of an older conflict.</p>



<p>The early trailer released to showcase pre-alpha gameplay of Battlefield 6 led us to believe that it’ll be set in a present-day theatre of war, which is good.</p>







<h3 id="h-squads-soldiers-and-platoons">Squads, Soldiers, and Platoons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 5 was much better for the player who <strong>loved </strong>Battlefield. It allowed them to form ‘Platoons’, it encouraged better squad-based play and saw players fill leadership roles, and it didn’t need to rely on Specialists (all with unique abilities, like a ‘hero shooter’) to fill out the ranks.</p>



<p>Many of these elements didn’t port over to Battlefield 2042, and it felt for a while like EA had stripped the community aspects from the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Wish Games Still Had Interesting Companion Apps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-games-still-had-interesting-companion-apps.1104405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I had a burst of nostalgia the other day. I was playing Dying Light to celebrate the game’s 10th anniversary and my mind flicked back to when the game was fresh on the market. One of my fondest memories of Dying Light is the game’s super helpful <strong>companion app</strong>, which allowed users to send scouts on virtual missions, which they’d claim rewards for later when they played the base game.</p>



<p>It had a few more features besides that, and it was a neat way to stay connected, still experience Dying Light’s universe on the go, and earn rewards without touching the game itself. It was discontinued a couple of years ago, but playing Dying Light got me thinking about the best companion apps for games that have long since disappeared.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beyond-the-numbers">Beyond The Numbers</h2>



<p>I’m not just talking about <strong>stat trackers</strong>, by the way – they’re a dime a dozen. Everything from League of Legends to World of Warcraft, and from EA FC to Destiny has a companion app, most of which is focused on tracking events, managing minor inventory mechanics, accessing account information, and sending messages in-game.</p>



<p>I miss when the best companion apps felt like games themselves – miniature versions of a top-tier title that would allow you to truly stay connected long after you’d logged off.</p>



<p>Dying Light’s companion app was a perfect example of this.</p>



<p>Players could utilise the app to run missions, arrange scouts to travel to the most dangerous parts of the game’s world, and progress through a chain of missions with progressively better rewards. They’d need to make sure they were picking the right runner for the job, and the rewards they scavenged could be collected later in the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light had a brilliant companion app</figcaption></figure>







<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag had a similar mechanic.</p>



<p>The companion app for Black Flag was stellar, allowing users to control a full-fledged fleet of ships, sending them around the world on a multitude of missions. It was discontinued in 2015, but while it was online, it offered another angle to experience the pirating adventures found at the heart of this monumental Assassin’s Creed title.</p>



<p>It was inherently linked to the game, too. As you played Black Flag and added ships to your fleet, you could command those ships in real time through the companion app. Then, you could log into the game later on and reap the rewards of those missions.</p>



<p>GTA 5’s ‘iFruit’ app was also quite good. It featured mini-games that the player could use to train Chop, an in-game dog that belonged to Franklin Clinton, one of the game’s protagonists. It was entertaining enough, featuring three basic games and some additional features like car customisation and a stat tracker.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was discontinued in 2022, almost a decade after it surfaced alongside GTA 5. Will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> have another version, considering it’s very social media-heavy?</p>



<h2 id="h-run-of-the-mill">Run of the Mill</h2>



<p>Most games that have a companion app typically offer a no-frills experience that might feature a codex, an interactive map, or some kind of news feed mechanic. The best example of this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which features just that. The map is nice enough, but it’s the most common thing for companion apps to feature.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Function over form, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>







<p>How about if Red Dead Online had a companion app through which you could send bandits or buddies on missions while you were offline, allowing them to gather resources and cash for you to use when you next played? I mean, RDO is another microtransaction-packed game, so it’s unlikely that would happen – Rockstar wants you to purchase those gold bars.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, some companion apps without engaging features like this are still plenty helpful. There’s a nice <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a> companion app <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/treestn-tarkov_companion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Overwolf</a> with interactive maps, quest trackers, and guides for weapon presets and information on the latest updates. In a game that’s as complex as Tarkov, that’s a <strong>very welcome </strong>addition.</p>



<p>But imagine if you could use a companion app to ‘automatically’ run ‘Scav’ raids, having a timer count down at the end of which you’d see the loot secured by a Scav – if they were successful. It’d be a spin-wheel mechanic that would have a different result every time, and I could see Battlestate Games charging for ‘extra Scavs’, but I think it’d be a hit.</p>



<p>Nobody likes running Scavs <strong>really</strong>, so if you confine them to a companion app, allowing players to run them while in a regular PMC raid, everyone is happy.</p>



<p>I don’t know if I’m being hit with nostalgia or if there’s a genuine demand out there for better, more immersive companion apps.</p>



<p>It’s probably just me…</p>



<p>Let me know if there’s a particular app you enjoy using on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-and-epic-adventure-in-bite-sized-chunks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Naske, our emissary, has been taken captive and we've been summoned to get her back. She's being held in the city of Easafir, a far cry from our humble forest home. Her plea for help suggests this might be more than just a rescue mission, and her captor might have designs on a larger prize unless we can stop them.</i></p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>was a successful Kickstarter back in 2022, and this month, they're launching the next KS for the second printing of the core set, and a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyboards/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-second-print-and-new-expansion" rel="nofollow">new expansion</a>. In this review though, we're just looking at the core&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em> set. While this is our first foray into <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, we've covered Mighty Boards products before. One of my earliest tabletop reviews on TechRaptor was the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vengeance-review-so-any-more-subordinates-for-me-to-kill" rel="nofollow">Vengeance</a>. Along with the board game we're reviewing here, <em>Fateforge</em> also has a tabletop RPG and upcoming video game, which you can check out <a href="https://fateforge.org/en" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>is&nbsp;an app-driven narrative cooperative adventure game that can be played solo, or with up to 4 players. Each player picks a character, and the app then guides you through a series of narrative options, battles, and side quests. Mighty Boards have deliberately focused the different elements into manageable chunks, with each combat taking around an hour, including set up, and the exploration and side quest elements between 15 and 30 mins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-6.jpg?itok=Yx1WpH_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-6.jpg?itok=ZcL9i1oI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The early build of our&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>Rogue adventurer.</figcaption></figure><h2>Chosen For Adventure</h2>

<p>The core<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>set has 5 character options that most will recognize as fantasy archetypes. There's the Mercenary, Rogue, Forest Guard, Shaman, and Noble. Each has their own unique dice pool and style of play, along with character development along the way. The Forest Guard for example starts with 3 blue and 1 green dice, blue for ranged combat and green for intelligence. The dice themselves have different icons for movement, ranged and melee combat, misses, and also focus which can be used to activate skills and abilities.</p>

<p>During each combat turn, all players roll 4 dice which will indicate what actions they can do during their turn. Certain abilities will let you reroll misses and convert some icons into others. The shaman's power chant for example can turn a miss into a focus, which they can then use to heal other party members. As the characters develop, you'll be able to change your dice pool and add more abilities to give you better options and more powerful attacks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-5.jpg?itok=Cs7HRNZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-5.jpg?itok=caaOoJeC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players decide when their characters will activate, and the app mixes in some surprise enemy reactions before all the enemies activate at the end of the round.</figcaption></figure><h2>The App Controller</h2>

<p>The <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>app takes players through the story, detailing all the narrative elements and offering choices as players progress. It also details how combat missions are set up, and regulates the actions of the enemies, which are controlled by AI scripts on cards. I found the AI controls for the enemies to be extremely well handled. Most maps are close enough that you could feel the pressure of the enemies, and although they could be worked around (some enemies don't move, and will only attack if you're in their or an adjacent zone), it felt in keeping with the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt that the game did suffer from what all app-driven games suffer from, and that's the feeling that sometimes it could all be done on the app, or none of it, and the transition between the two, especially in combat can feel a little jarring. I forgot to progress the app during combat a few times, following the combat phase stages until the reaction phase of the enemies, which is detailed by the app. It does progress the narrative well, and the way it remembers and changes the narrative based on your actions is difficult to do with pure physical components.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-3.jpg?itok=twu_GF5Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-3.jpg?itok=DHEUXOfF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>enemy type has an AI action programe they follow when they activate.</figcaption></figure><h2>Are We Nearly There Yet?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, Mighty Boards have deliberately managed the timing of combats and narrative sessions in&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, and the pacing feels great. In a full gaming night, you can get through several combats and their linked events, or if you're only able to meet for an hour or so, you can move slowly through the campaign that way and it won't feel like your campaign is stagnating if you can't meet for longer sessions.</p>

<p>The game is challenging as well, and your health doesn't fully regenerate between combats, making you manage it between combats, or deal with the scenarios differently. If you're low on health, you will have to choose to miss objectives, just punch straight through to the exit, or be a lot more tactical in avoiding combat and enemies. My Rogue and Forest Guard combination sees the Rogue rushing forward, stunning and removing enemies, and the Forest Guard trying to take out the rest at range. They had no healing between them, so if the Rogue's stealth failed and she took a beating, it meant us trying to avoid combat for the rest of that scenario, and possibly the next.</p>

<p>The story itself is a lot more engaging than I thought it would be, and the city itself, the characters you meet, and the choices you make feel very impactful, and is probably as close as you could get to a full roleplaying game without a Games Master.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-4.jpg?itok=X99Yce6l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-4.jpg?itok=gaux9ach 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can save poor dice rolls with your skills and abilities, by changing die faces to what you need.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan&nbsp;Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I was surprised by&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan. </em>I thought the dice combat was going to be annoying (I usually prefer to just choose my actions), but the different skills and abilities as you level up make it a unique and challenging puzzle, and although the enemies have set AI controls that can be worked around, it feels like part of the game. The setup and play time is fast and the story is extremely rewarding, and each of the different character options feels unique, and their development, along with that of the core narrative is extremely engaging.</p>

<p>The app is very prevalent, so if app-driven content isn't your thing, you can't avoid it here, but it does add to the game well, and although it does feel like the entire thing could be done digitally, without the need for physical components, having that physical element, especially with 2 to 4 players, helps keep it grounded in the moment.&nbsp;</p>

That’s true…<em>to some extent</em>. Some builds prove viable from the get-go, capable of pushing all of the end-game content across Wraeclast. Others, not so much. For example, the Warrior, while entertaining as you smash your foes with reckless abandon, poses a problem in the end-game because most late-game enemies and bosses excel against melee builds.

		<p>Following the remarkable 24 hours downtime for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psn">PlayStation Network</a> on Saturday 8th February, Sony as issued an apology and announced compensation for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> members – everyone will have five days added to their current subscriptions.</p>
<p>Writing on a certain social media hellhole, Sony writes:</p>


<p>Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience. All PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional 5 days of service.</p>
<p>At this time Sony hasn’t actually issued an explanation for what caused the downtime. Naturally, given historical service outages, there’s speculation over whether this was an attempted hack, as in 2011, a brazen DDoS attack, as in December 2014, or something more mundane, like a backend update gone wrong.</p>
<p>5 days of extra PS Plus is decent recompense for subscribers, though it’s not exactly perfect. For one thing, it means that those playing free-to-play titles that don’t require PS Plus were also affected and seemingly won’t get any kind of love here.</p>

<p>Companies who were holding events and betas this weekend are also trying to adjust and make up for the lost time. Capcom is considering having an extra 24 hours for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-2-is-coming-in-february/">Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2</a>, and we’ll see if Activision does similar for the current double XP event.</p>
<p>There’s also a bit of a knock on effect for frugal gamers that look to take advantage of sale periods, particularly around Black Friday. Letting your subscription lapse at the right time leaves you then able to grab another year on discount with a “new” customer promotion, which isn’t typically available to existing subscribers. 5 extra days being automatically added could knock a whole swathe of players out of the window to take advantage of these offers.</p>
<p>Anyway. It’s Sunday and PSN is live and kicking once again. Happy online gaming, everyone!</p>

			<p>All PlayStation Plus members will receive compensation for the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-down/">PlayStation Network outage</a>, Sony confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on X, it has been confirmed that network services have fully recovered from an unspecified operational issue, and that all PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional five days of service, which is definitely decent compensation, considering the outage lasted for a little over 20 hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience. All PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional 5 days of service.</p>
<p>— Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This operational issue that caused the PlayStation Network outage on Friday couldn't have come at a worse time, as it prevented PS5 owners from trying out the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta for almost an entire day, which will unlikely get extended to compensate for the outage, at least for this phase, unless CAPCOM decides to surprise players in the next few hours. [<strong>Update:</strong> CAPCOM is considering running the open beta for an additional 24 hours to compensate for the outage at a later date.] Still, at the very least, the outage did not last over 20 days as it did in 2011 when PSN suffered a hacking attack where the personal information of users was stolen. Back then, users were compensated for the long outage with a free one-month subscription, a one-month PlayStation Plus membership extension, and two free games between five PS3 and four PSP games, which included some solid games like the first entry in the inFAMOUS series.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-vr-first-time/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-vr-first-time/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In just a couple of days, players worldwide will get their hands on the long-awaited release of Civilization 7 (stylised as Civilization VII). It has been almost a decade since the last major release in the Civ series, and fans are understandably very excited for the chance to drive empires forward once again.</p>



<p>Recently, an entirely new perspective on the Civilization series was revealed – a <strong>VR version </strong>of Civ 7. It’s being developed by PlaySide Studios and 2K in collaboration with Firaxis and it’s coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S in the spring.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-truly-immersive">Truly Immersive</h2>



<p>Firaxis, PlaySide, and 2K worked to release a new trailer for Civilization 7, this one surprisingly showcasing a never-before-seen VR version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The world of VR has gone from strength to strength of late. The technology is sharpening, price points are dropping slightly, and the library of games and apps available on the best headsets is forever expanding. It’s still a tentative area for some, but some developers are investing much more in the technology, which is great for those who love the immersion.</p>



<p>This is the first time in history that a Civilization game has been available on VR platforms, and it’s coming <strong>exclusively </strong>to Meta Quest 3 and 3S – which isn’t an unheard of thing these days. These headsets dominate the market, and as a Quest 3 owner, I can say that they’re generally the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>The trailer shows exactly how this’ll work, with a unique UI and configuration created solely for VR users to enjoy the relatively complex experience that Civilization 7 promises to offer. Given how long the average game of Civ 7 lasts, it could be pretty exhausting and you might need an external battery on your headset, but those are choices for you to make.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll pick up Civilization 7 on Meta Quest? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has given an actual reason for the PlayStation Network (PSN) outage that brought the service down for roughly 20 hours on Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>In a post late Saturday night on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company blamed the outage on an “operational issue”. Specifics on the issue weren’t given nor was anything said about preventing another issue. However, PlayStation  did, once again, apologize for what happened.</p>



<p>“Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue,” they said. “We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience.”</p>

<p>As a make good for nearly a full day of service being lost, PlayStation is giving all PlayStation Plus members five extra days. The extension will automatically be added to all plans.</p>



<p>The PSN <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally went down</a> on Friday, February 7 around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store. It started to come back around 3:40PM ET on Saturday, February 8.</p>



<p>As the service was offline, the company didn’t provide any updates to players aside from an acknowledgement of PSN being offline hours after it went down. The next update came to state that service was restored. </p>



<p>What do you think about the reason PlayStation gave for the PSN outage? What about receiving five days of PlayStation Plus for the troubles? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon.1104267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week brings with it a fresh batch of Games Workshop products up for pre-order, and this week we're taking a quick sneak peek at a few important new releases for&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>. Games Workshop provided me with preview copies of two new Death Korps of Krieg units, as well as a PDF of the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K Crusade: Nachmund Gauntlet</em>, which brings campaign play back into the 41st millenium! Read on for my first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K Crusade - Nachmund Gauntlet</h2>

<p>Enclosed in this massive tome is everything you need to start running your own&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K&nbsp;</em>campaign with your gaming group, compatible with the latest edition of the rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=rrjN1Ntn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=yONWzMBc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Step into war on the bloody streets of Sangua Terra!</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet - Storytelling At Its Finest</h3>

<p>This massive book, which clocks in at around 120 pages, dives deep into the story so far - we learn of the warlords seeking to lay claim to the world of Sangua Terra, one of the fortified bastions against Chaos in the famed Nachmund Gauntlet.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the lore of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>, and want to know the latest in the story the underpins the events of the game as a whole, this is a treasure trove of fantastic storytelling. One of the aspects I most love about all the Codexes and rulebooks that come out for all Games Workshop products is the level of storytelling on display. This isn't simple "the baddies are moving closer to their goal" writing, we dive deep into the various factions at play, their machinations, and more.</p>

<h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Build Your Forces, See Them Through</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;many campaign rules for this game, it's hard to cover it all in a preview. So I'll keep it brief for the sake of discovery. In this Crusade book, you'll find rules to help guide a campaign over a series of missions, and there's a truly robust ruleset designed to help you play through it all.</p>

<p>You'll order all players into the campaign into alliances (ideally based on the army they're fielding) split between Guardians who seek to protect Sangua Terra, Despoilers who wish to conquer the world, and Marauders who seek to use the turmoil on Sangua Terra to their own benefit.</p>

<p>There are also a whole suite of Crusade rules specific to this Sangua Terran war, including how to use Crusade Badges, Battle Traits, Crusade Relics, and rules on using Tactical Reserves, recording your missions, blessings, agendas, and so much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=JwMd1Xxb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=ur_LOfq3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from Games Workshop showcasing how the turmoil of the Crusade can look on your battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Missions</h3>

<p>As for the missions included in this book, you'll find fifteen distinct missions that see forces doing everything from securing drop sites to acting as heralds for larger incoming forces. One of my favorites is the Saboteurs mission, which sees the Attacker-designated player trying to get deep into Defender territory to use a special action to sabotage important points on the map.</p>

<p>All throughout, these missions seem to me to balance a bit of novel and thematic gameplay with well-balanced challenges. There's nothing in here that feels so story driven that you're at a disadvantage for being on the wrong side of the narrative. This is a seriously robust Crusade book, and if you've got a regular playgroup or a local shop running this campaign, it's well-worth checking out.</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg New Releases</h2>

<p>Many, many new releases are coming this week for pre-order for the Death Korps of Krieg army. We recently covered the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box" rel="nofollow">brand new Krieg Army Box</a> that just released for the forces, and many of the units that were bundled in the box are now available for pre-order separately. I'm now getting my first look at two additional units coming that weren't included in the box set: The Krieg Heavy Weapons Squad, and the Krieg Command Squad.</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Heavy Weapons Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=49PN03cC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=NhpYXT7D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Heavy Weapons Squad unleashes serious firepower.</figcaption></figure><p>The Heavy Weapons Squad is designed to be built and suited to your needs! Each unit contains three Heavy Weapons Gunner models and one Fire Coordinator model, and each model has both a laspistol and close combat weapon for when the battle gets a little too close to them.</p>

<p>But we're not here to talk about laspistols! The standard construction for these models is to have each Heavy Weapons Gunner equipped with a lascannon, which fires a single shot at a staggering 12 Strength, dealing D6+1 damage per hit. But you can swap these out as you see fit to include a Twin Krieg heavy stubber which hits hard with three Attacks per model and has Rapid Fire 3.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also build these models with a Krieg heavy flamer, which has the "ignores cover" and "torrent" keywords and deals d6 attacks at 2 damage each.</p>

<p>All in all, this unit is a great option if you want some heavy fire but don't like fielding tanks!</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Command Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=Ie3Xpszc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=AnF8d1_4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Krieg Command Squad is great for getting those crucial orders issued to your army.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's take a look at the new Krieg Command Squad! This is the Krieg army knife of the army, with so many different weapon loadouts for the various members of the Squad. Where it really all comes together is in the Wargear abilities for the various bits, bobs, and gadgets attached to your models.</p>

<p>Let's chat about those abilities quickly: there's the Master Vox - which allows the Officer in this unit to issue orders up to 24" away, the Alchemyk Counteragents - which gives the unit the "Feel No Pain 6+" ability against mortal wounds, the Regimental Standard - which adds 1 to the Objective Control score of models in the unit (that's for&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;model), and the Servo-scribes - which, once per battle, lets the Officer issue two Orders at once (and is marked with a very cool Servo-scribes model).</p>

<p>If you're trying to get the most out of issuing orders to your Krieg army, this unit is not only pretty tough, and full of great weaponry, but they'll help you get those orders out efficiently.</p>

<p>That covers everything we got a chance to check out early with this week's preorder previews! Let us know what you think about these new releases in the comments!</p>

<p>The PlayStation Network is back online after being down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for nearly 20 hours</a>. Now, shortly after service was fully restored, PlayStation has issued a (very) brief update on the status of the network via social media.</p>



<p>“PSN has been restored,” the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1888376843255824475?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post said</a>. “You should be able to access online features without any problems now. </p>



<p>“Sorry for the inconvenience!”</p>



<p>The company also pointed people to the official PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page</a> where it lists all services as currently functioning.</p>



<h6 id="h-new-episode-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">NEW EPISODE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Aside from the apology, nothing else has been said by PlayStation. There has been no mention of what caused the outage in the first place. In fact, it was the first official statement from Sony since they made a post on Friday night stating that it was  “aware some users” were having problems. In between the post acknowledging the problem and the service being restored, the only other thing PlayStation posted was <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888316952004673561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how to add M.2 storage</a> to the console.</p>



<p>PlayStation Network originally went down on Friday night around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to PlayStation in an attempt to get an update as to what caused the PlayStation Network to go offline this weekend. Should a response be received—or an more in-depth statement be made in an official capacity—it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/interview-zellsis-talks-sentinels-strengths-and-weaknesses-after-qualifying-for-masters-bangkok/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-patch-10-02-notes-all-changes-and-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> scriptwriters for VCT Americas brought back a favorite from last season. Sentinels have qualified for the first Masters event of the year after a hot start at Kickoff, thanks to a masterful performance from Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro in the lower final versus MIBR.</p>



<p>Known to some fans as the “vibes merchant” or just the Sentinels’ bundle salesman, Zellsis had his best individual series performance in years against MIBR. After the series in which he got just his second ace in VCT, the former Sentinels sub turned superstar spoke to Insider Gaming on his otherworldly performance, his progression as an emotional leader, and the things the team still needs to improve.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A stupendous series from you against MIBR. What was the key to your performance?</strong></p>



<p>Zellsis: It has to be my teammates. Usually I’m the one that has to come in and keep everyone’s mood up, lift the energy, everything like that. And I kind of did not do that [today], I was just mellow, I kept my vibes neutral and focused on the game, instead of bashing my head against the wall like I usually do to keep emotions up.</p>



<p>My teammates started off the series with really good energy, so it made my job a little bit easier. When we got to Split though, I got a bit more amped because we loss a very intense [game of] Pearl, so I wanted us to get a bit more hype. But my teammates are insane as well; if I had brought the mood, one of them would have picked up the shooting.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Speaking of that Pearl, we saw a little bit of frustration from you after that knife from Aspas, and then some disappointed faces from the team after the map ended. How did you and the team recover after those moments?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, on the 1v2 I kind of raged. I was just very into the series, I did not want to lose. There were a lot of rounds that should have gone our way, and a lot of rounds where I messed up some key things. I knew one guy was Pit and one was Art, and I just whiffed and got very frustrated in the heat of the moment.</p>



<figure><figcaption>All smiles in SEN City. Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The MVP of vibes was N4RRATE. He was phenomenal today in keeping the vibes up, micro calling for people, and calling out mistakes. I think that’s a big thing that we’re starting to learn on stage together. We need to be calling each other out more when shit goes wrong. None of us are babies, we can fix it in the moment, and if you can’t, then you obviously don’t want to win.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You spoke the other day about your emotional maturity improving and “clicking” over these past couple years. Are there other players or coaches that helped you get better?</strong></p>



<p>All my coaches have always looked at me to be the leader on all my teams from Immi on Version1, to mCe on Cloud9, to now kaplan on Sentinels. They heavily rely on me being the emotional leader for everyone. People who know me know I’m very honest, I’m very brute, and I don’t beat around the bush. But I never try to put someone down when I’m saying something, it’s all about getting better and improving and making sure we’re in the right spot to win.</p>



<p>On C9, when vanity and yay left, mCe forced me to be more of a leader. When we got runi and jakee, we needed a huge voice on that C9 roster. We had the talent, we just didn’t have a lot of voices, we didn’t have a lot of decisive decision-making. And whether I wanted it to be me or not, mCe forced me into that. We had a lot of one-on-ones [together], and it kind of just spiraled me into always having to be like that now. And I’m not complaining, it’s made me a better player overall and a more complete player overall. I can control my emotions more. I can control when I talk about mistakes more and everything like that.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Do you feel your leadership role has increased this year after the departures of Sacy and TenZ?</strong></p>



<p>I definitely think we lack a little bit in high pressure mid-rounding situations. Sacy didn’t really do a lot of micro mid-rounding, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his blueprint of playing the game was fundamentally the right way to play</a> the game. And that’s what he would kind of bring: “Okay, they’re doing this, we need to be doing this.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He just plays culturally differently than a lot of Americas teams. [NA teams] are always rushing, taking ones, whereas I feel like Brazilian teams always played fundamentally sound and he’s always played like that. So he brought that to this team when he played with us. I think with this team, we’re definitely missing a little bit of that discipline that he brought us. But we’re working on it.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What does it say about this team to be able to rebound from such a lopsided loss to G2 and qualify for Masters Bangkok?</strong></p>



<p>I think people need to remember we haven’t been a team [with this roster] that long. We’ve changed roles, we’ve changed so much to fit this team. And we’re still so young, I mean I’m 26 turning 27, John’s 26 turning 27. And then the drop off is insane: N4RRATE’s 22, bang is 20, and zekken is 19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more re: mental and maturity to work on, but we all want to win and we work hard. I can confidently say this team is one of the hardest working teams I’ve ever been on, from the coaching staff to the players.</p>



<p>Can Zellsis and Sentinels claim another trophy this year? Let us know down below or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-to-get-vr-port-for-quest-3-this-spring/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sid-meier%E2%80%99s-civilization-vii-to-get-vr-port-for-quest-3-this-spring.1104210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-to-get-vr-port-for-quest-3-this-spring/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, a very surprising announcement took place during the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-world-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civ World Summit</a>, where publisher 2K and developer Firaxis Games announced that Sid Meier's Civilization VII will be released in VR for Quest 3. This is the first game in the franchise to ever be released in VR and it is a major milestone for the franchise. There isn't a set release date as of yet, but the game is set to release in VR this Spring.</p>
<p>Accompanying the announcement is a trailer for the VR version of the game, which you will be able to watch below to see what you can expect from the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the VR port of this game will be exclusive to the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S, which means there's a large portion of VR users who won't be able to access this game. Already, some fans have made complaints, stating that the VR port of this game should also be on PSVR at the very least. At the moment, it's not certain whether the game is part of a timed exclusive launch or if it's permanently exclusive for that headset.</p>
<p>Civilization VII VR will be handled by the VR veterans at PlaySide Studios, a company based in Australia. Players can choose to swap between VR and mixed reality at any point during their play. In this experience, players will get to view a diorama-style Command Table, much like those seen in historical games and TV shows. The VR version of the game will also provide detailed dioramas of in-game achievements, such as building Wonders and the Archives. Like the original version of the game, you can play solo or compete in online multiplayer matches, where you can play with up to three other Meta Quest 3 and 3S users.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you would want to play, Civilization VII VR can be wishlisted already on the Meta Store. While 2K hasn't announced a release date, they are aiming for a Spring 2025 launch, with more information likely to come at a later date. While there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/firaxis-reveals-the-civilization-vii-roadmap-for-2025/">no DLCs out</a> for the game at the current moment as it has just been released, it's unsaid whether these DLCs will also be available for the VR port of the game. However, it is assumed that all DLC content will also be released for the VR version of the game to keep it fair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/609029/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-is-coming-to-the-quest-soon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em>Civilization </em>franchise is getting the VR treatment with <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - VR</em> on Meta Quest headsets this spring, 2K and Firaxis Games <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/sid-meiers-civilizationr-vii-vr-launching-on-meta-quest-3-and-3s-in-spring-2025">have announced</a>. The “virtual and mixed reality” game will be available for the Quest 3 and 3S, but no price or specific release date has been announced quite yet.</p><p>How are 2K and Firaxis making it work? It’s presented through a “board game-like construction” that’s projected into your physical space using the Quest’s passthrough cameras or shown in a virtual museum environment “looking out onto a vista personalized to your leader,” <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-civ-7-vr-wishlist/">says a Meta blog post</a> about the release. You can switch between the two modes at any time, Meta writes. And when you’re playing in multiplayer mode, you’ll see your opponents around the table, represented by the digital bodies of their chosen leaders.</p><p>Here’s a trailer for the game.</p><p>Meta writes that this version “brings the true <em>Civ</em> experience” to the Quest. For instance, you’ll be able to pick whatever leader you want to run a civilization, a new tweak to the <em>Civilization</em> formula that my colleague Ash Parrish wrote about in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/604489/civilization-7-review">her review of the regular game</a>. One gameplay difference Meta mentions is that the game is sped up by default compared to other editions — not everyone finds VR headsets comfortable for long sessions, after all — but the company adds that you can adjust the pace to your liking.</p><p>We’ll see just how close <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - VR</em> hews to the PC and console versions of the game when it’s released in the spring. Until then, I’ll be thinking about that <em>Futurama</em> episode in which Bender becomes a god.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Co-creator of Back to The Future, Bob Gale, has said that a new video game is in the works. </p>



<p>The news came in a new interview by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cleveland.com</a> (paywalled), who had the opportunity to sit down and speak to Back to the Future’s co-creator Bob Gale.</p>



<p>In the interview, Gale was asked “what’s next” for him in the Back to the Future universe, to which he replied, “We’ve got a shot at a new video game based on Back to the Future.”</p>



<p>Gale continued, ”&nbsp;I don’t want to tell you any more than that because I’m not allowed to, but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen. Of course, 2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie. We’re planning on some events, plus there’s a documentary that’s in post-production now about the making of the musical.”</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, Back to the Future has had a game before called “Back to the Future: The Game” and released in December 2010 by Telltale Games and released in 5 parts, known as espisodes.</p>



<p>The game received fairly positive reviews and reached number 3 in the PlayStation 3 sales charts on its release, however, Telltale Games did not release any sales figures.</p>

The map takes shape atop a Command Table that lets you peer down from high above or lean all the way in to appreciate the finer details of buildings and units, like a tabletop game come to life. Players will chart a course for their people and engage face-to-face with iconic world leaders around the Command Table, each reacting as you forge alliances or declare war through the Ages.</blockquote><blockquote>Civilization 7 - VR is available to play in either immersive virtual reality or mixed reality, and you'll be able to freely switch between the two at any time. In virtual reality, players are transported to an ornate museum as they look out onto a vista personalized to their leader; in mixed reality, the Command Table adapts to its placement in a player's physical space. Detailed dioramas can be viewed in The Archives, a room in your museum dedicated to your gameplay achievements displayed in both virtual and mixed reality. In addition to single-player, Civilization 7 - VR can compete to rule the world in online multiplayer matches with up to three other Meta Quest 3 and 3S players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis’ 4X strategy sequel is currently available on PC and console to those who paid more for advanced access, and they’re certainly letting their voices be known in Steam user reviews, highlighting issues with the user interface, a lack of map variety, and a feeling that Civilization 7 has launched without a number of features they've come come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis has <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded to this feedback</u></a>, promising improvements to the UI, the addition of teams to multiplayer games so people can play co-operatively, and a wider variety of map types, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN ahead of the release of third quarter financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that Civilization 7 had received some negative reviews from press and players</a>, but insisted that the “legacy Civ audience” will come around the more they play, and called Civilization 7’s early performance “very encouraging.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?

<p>It hasn’t been a smooth launch for the new-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability</a> alongside allegations of a paper launch from consumers, those who’ve been lucky enough to get one of the new $2,000 GPUs aren’t without their issues.</p>



<p>Over the last few days, posts on various <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2669678-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1if73o9/rtx_5090_not_detected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddits</a> have appeared with claims that the GPUs—both the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and Chinese-specific RTX 5090D—are bricking. The common claim among all posts is that the cards are being undetected by their systems. Some have tried clearing the CMOS while others simply cleaned and reinstalled the drivers for the cards. None of those efforts have seemed to work.</p>

<p>The reports began to get so frequent that Nvidia had to issue a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We are investigation the reported issues with the RTX 50 series,” the company told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-investigating-the-reported-issues-with-the-rtx-50-series-cards-after-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-owners-and-some-rtx-40-series-folk-report-black-screen-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a vague statement from Nvidia, but it does acknowledge that they know there’s an issue. What’s caused the problem will likely be revealed if and when Nvidia releases a fix or offers solutions for those suffering.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is staring the naysayers in the face and battling them back with reckless abandon. Despite campaigns on social media to smear the game’s image, the Warhorse Studios RPG is soaring up the charts. It has now more than <strong>doubled </strong>the peak player count of 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance on Steam, and it’s not slowing down.</p>



<p>KCD2 is proving to be a smash hit. Not only did it receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glowing praise in my review</a>, but it’s already one of 2025’s most decorated games. It sold more than one million copies in a single day, with Warhorse Studios and Plaion making a profit within 24 hours of launch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-up">On the Up</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had, at the time of publishing, hit a peak player count of 233,586 users. That dwarfs the record set by the first title, which was released in 2018 and secured a peak count on Steam of 95,800.</p>



<p>Incredibly, the launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has worked wonders for the first game. Players worldwide are flooding the first game to get the scope of the story before landing in the sequel. At the time of writing, the first game was sitting on a peak player count of 38,669 users, the highest it had been since March 2018.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has had some trouble on social platforms because of some of the more complex themes present, but that’s not enough to slow down the growth of this phenomenal title.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has already revealed that this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major expansions</a> will be released for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The developer has a wonderful track record in that arena, having released a string of top expansions for the first game that provided entertainment long after the story was completed.</p>
