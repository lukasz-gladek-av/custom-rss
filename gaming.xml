            <p>US workers body SAG-AFTRA says its voice actors strike could still impact projects that have been in development for over a year, including games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, despite the terms of its agreement stating they should be safe.</p>
<p>Initially, last week's shock announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike action by video game actors over AI concerns</a> was thought to have minimal impact on games expected to release later this year, as it did not include games that commenced production before August 2023.</p>

<p>Now, however, SAG-AFTRA says all "members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work", intimating that it believed the strike could be more disruptive than previously suspected and impact "non-struck" games.</p>
<p>"Members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work on these titles," SAG-AFTRA's chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sag-aftra-strike-video-game-ai">Inverse</a>.</p>
<p>"And we know that many of our members are going to become unavailable to work on those.</p>
<p>"So while [non-struck games like GTA 6] may not be subject to a strike in the technical sense, their production is also subject to being disrupted by members who don't want to work without the protection of AI terms and who don't want to undermine solidarity with the union."</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union announced a strike after failing to reach a deal with major video game companies over the use of AI</a> following "more than a year and a half of negotiations".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">UK actors' union Equity says it stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA</a> following news of the strike, though won't be authorising a strike itself.</p>

            <p>Happy this week! I return from holiday to find that Nic, James and the others have been experimenting with the use of Maw-shaped sock puppets to feed the Maw, in the hope that the Maw might form a filial bond with our news-wranglers. Unfortunately, we've learned in the process that anything that <em>resembles</em> the Maw <em>behaves</em> like the Maw. The sockpuppets were last seen tunnelling towards Los Angeles, like the sandworms in Dune. Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On <strong>Monday 29th July</strong>, there is nothing but sadness and desolation and desperate SOS messages from Los Angeles. On <strong>Tuesday 30th July</strong>, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-garden-path">The Garden Path</a>, an autumnal horticulture sim whose demo Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-5">enjoyed</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-landlord-sim-space-for-sale-looks-thrillingly-unsavoury">Space For Sale</a>, in which you build domed houses on unreceptive planets. Also on 30th July, the turn-based Neon Evangelism of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-seed">Arc Seed</a>, and the early access launch of free-to-play Blizzardy RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stormgate">Stormgate</a>. <strong>Wednesday 31st July</strong> has us managing planes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2289650/Mini_Airways/">Mini Airways</a>, organising frog toes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708320/Tidy_Cauldron/">Tidy Cauldron</a>, and breaking bad in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450700/Drug_Lord_Tycoon/">Drug Lord Tycoon</a> (See also: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/revisiting-dope-wars-98-for-some-ungodly-reason">Nic's recent piece on Dope Wars 98</a>). On <strong>Thursday 1st August</strong>, the chance to play travelling salesman in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You're Here</a>, from the Untitled Goose Game devs. Alternatively, you could try free-to-play tactics RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526380/Sword_of_Convallaria/">Sword of Convallaria</a>, which appears to be Final Fantasy Tactics plus an undetermined quantity of gacha. And on <strong>Friday 2nd August</strong>: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/">Motördoom</a>, a horde shooter which is also a Tony Hawk game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deviator">Deviator</a>, a metroidvania out to steal Hollow Knight's lunch, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-goo-2">World of Goo 2</a>, sequel to the Prometheus of indie physics puzzlers, which came out shortly before I got into james gournalism <em>16 years ago</em>. Time for more sadness and desolation!</p>
<p>It's possible these are not the week's best and most interesting games. It's possible I'm lying, plying the readership with talk of indie comebacks, while quietly sliding a copy of Half-Life 3 into my trenchcoat. Only you, the intrepid gourmand of interactive entertainments, can set me straight. Let us know about any games we've missed in the comments, and find our weekly news liveblog below. Have a good one.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-new-gameplay-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChinaJoy </a>2024 is in full swing, and we've got several new gameplay showcases for high-profile games like Astro Bot and Phantom Blade Zero, courtesy of Gematsu.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is Sony's flagship game for this year. Developed by Team Asobi (formerly Japan Studio), it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during May's PlayStation Showcase event. We've since learned that it is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest game</a> made by the studio yet, featuring over 80 levels spanning three different worlds for a total length <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-length/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be between 12 and 15 hours. Game Director Nicolas Doucet also <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-ditched-open-world-design-to-provide-optimal-variety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Team Asobi considered using open world design but decided against it to provide optimal variety.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5 on September 6. A PC version coming in a year or two is all but guaranteed, though, considering Sony's strategy to bring all of its first-party games to the platform in due time.</p>

<p>ChinaJoy 2024 also hosted a stage event for Phantom Blade Zero, the highly anticipated action RPG developed by Chinese studio S-GAME. <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused </a>on boss fights and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot</a> be considered a Soulslike title. Game Director and Founder Soulframe Liang told Wccftech that Phantom Blade Zero will probably still take a few years before completion:</p>
<p><em>Even for the most experienced team, completing a project like this would take several years, not to mention our team are relatively young.</em><br>
<em>We cannot yet estimate the exact time of project completion, but we will try to showcase some of the latest achievements during different stages of development. We hope everyone can continue to follow our progress and stay tuned！</em></p>

<p>In addition to Astro Bot and Phantom Blade Zero, ChinaJoy 2024 was also the venue to showcase new projects from Chinese studios like Project: Jinyiwei, Loulan, Infinity Nikki, and Unending Dawn for the first time. You can check out those videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gematsu/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu's YouTube channel</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/f1-manager-24-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-manager-24-review.939210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/f1-manager-24-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For all that F1 centres on driving talents like Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen, it is a sport that’s built on statistics. For the biggest teams, crew numbers stretch into the hundreds, with specialists focused on every aspect of the car, and the variables that can affect it, from sole components to tyre wear and aerodynamics – just look at the fine margins of tyre weight that seemingly led to this weekend’s controversial result! EA’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">F1 24</a> allows you to live out your driver fantasies, but what about those hoping to be the next James Vowles or wanting to channel their inner Hannah Schmitz? F1 Manager 24 lets you take control of an entire F1 team, bringing success through clever strategy, correct car setup and an eye for detail. It’s also the best entry in Frontier’s series so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1® Manager 24 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMGvWYg7crI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>F1 Manager 24 takes a big step forward over last year’s entry with the arrival of Create A Team. It’s almost unbelievable that we’ve had to wait for this feature, but now that it’s here it lives up to expectations, allowing you to personalise and take true ownership of your team’s journey to the top of the podium.</p>


<p>The inclusion of real-life footage immediately makes you feel like you’re entering the world of F1, and as a newcomer to the paddock, you’re heralded with the right level of excitement. What isn’t exciting, is the very short character limit for your team name, so my dreams of operating Leighton Motorsport were immediately dashed. Come on Frontier, if you can’t input at least one of the real team names – McLaren International Ltd character counters – surely we could have had one or two more letters for custom teams?</p>
<p>Once you’ve made peace with the name your team will be sporting, you have to settle on an origin story, from living the life of a billionaire and starting your own team, to joining forces with a high-quality tech startup. It’s a nice little touch that dictates the quality of the car, facilities, drivers and staff you have access to, as well as your starting capital, bringing in a touch of narrative to a game that is ostensibly about the numbers.</p>


<p>Then it’s time for the fun stuff, selecting your drivers, and key staff members. Depending on your earlier choices, you’re going to have access to different people here, but I was able to go with an Alex Albon and Oscar Piastri pairing, while most of my technical staff were lured away from Red Bull, apart from Mercedes Bono, who’s a star in his own right. You can be right in the thick of it from the start, and it’s so appealing if you’re a fan. If you’re not, well, I’m surprised you’re still here.</p>
<p>While there’s plenty of fiction going on, the sport remains grounded in the real world, and it was interesting to note how our second season began, with moves like Lewis Hamilton’s jump to Ferrari happening in sync with the real world. That said, a few shifts like the disappearance of Perez from the grid and his replacement at Red Bull by Carlos Sainz, remain the stuff of (plausible) fantasy.</p>
<p>Progressing the calendar is your main focus between sessions, and from here there’s plenty of the cut and thrust of the F1 back office, including sponsor negotiations, staff appraisals and car development. Balancing the needs of your sponsors, and for the essential income it provides, is done in an interesting way, forcing you to balance the knock-on effect of each event against different sectors of your operation. I mostly focused on not impacting my team’s drivers, but at the expense of my other staff and the effectiveness of the facilities. Moving from being the worst team on the grid to the seventh suggest that it was a solid enough strategy.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, you get out what you put in here. F1 Manager is a very menu-heavy game, and just like the real sport, it’s all about maximising every aspect of the car, the team and the driver. If you’re turned off by the idea of clicking through multiple menus and changing different sliders by a couple of notches, then I don’t think F1 Manager 24 is the one for you.</p>
<p>That extends even further into the races themselves. The overall presentation here is fantastic for a management sim, with multiple camera angles available throughout the race, and the option to accelerate time so you can whiz through an event if you need to, with faster speeds switching from track cameras to a track map instead. However, you’re missing the point if you do. Watching the races unfold naturally, albeit at double the speed – which is a decent balance between realism and feeling like a Benny Hill sketch – while altering your driver’s strategy on the fly and adapting to this entry’s new mechanical failures is the most fun and engaging part of the game.</p>

<p>You feel like you’re in control, cementing the idea that you’re an integral part of this race team, and while it might ultimately boil down to watching a series of numbers tick along, it’s hypnotic and satisfying in equal measure. It doesn’t feel overwhelming either, letting you control as much or as little as you want. If you’re in a hurry you can simulate sessions or whole events, but it does feel you could probably be doing something else altogether if you’re not interacting with it.</p>
<p>F1 Manager 24 really does look and sound the part, and the combination of opening commentary, audio snippets and compelling visual style, make this feel as true to life as possible. It might not be as flashy as Codemasters’ F1 24, but Frontier has captured the sport with a refined eye for detail. It’s even more appealing when you watch your created team’s car zip past a Red Bull too.</p>

<p>Crazy Raccoon has lifted the Esports World Cup trophy for the Overwatch 2 category, waltzing through to the Grand Final and decimating Toronto Ultra, one of the frontrunners to secure victory at the historic tournament. Crazy Raccoon’s dominance was visible for all to see, with the team pushing through the entire event and dropping just two maps.</p>



<p>Toronto Ultra was sharp, but Crazy Raccoon was on another level entirely.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weird-name-great-team">Weird Name, Great Team</h2>



<p>Crazy Raccoon is a Japanese organisation that was founded in 2018 – but it didn’t enter the Overwatch 2 scene until April of this year. The organisation stood up a roster to compete in the Esports World Cup, and by all accounts, it went <strong>very</strong> <strong>well. </strong>In June, the squad won a $100,000 prize by securing victory at the OCS 2024 Major, setting the tone for the months to follow.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this isn’t a nobody team that has made it big – Crazy Raccoon’s roster is represented by some of the best Overwatch players of all time. Last year, CH0R0NG won the OWL playoffs – the final stage before the competition was ultimately shut down for good. Then there’s Shu, who has won several high-tier tournaments to become one of the wealthiest Overwatch players in the business.</p>



<p>They perhaps pale somewhat in comparison to Lee ‘LIP’ Jae-won, a pivotal player on the squad who claimed the top spot in the 2021 Playoffs and at a further 12 major events (not counting the EWC), almost all of which were won when playing with the Shanghai Dragons.</p>



<p>This weekend, the team almost swept Toronto Ultra, but the latter squad managed to win just one map with the closest finish we’ve seen for years in competitive Overwatch. On Runasapi, the Push came down to the closest distance break possible, with Toronto winning with 130.43 meters over CR’s 130.42 meters. </p>



<p>It wasn’t enough, though – Crazy Raccoon shut Ultra down in the next map, winning $400,000 and a much-needed allotment of 1,000 Club Championship points.</p>



<p>This was a pretty big defeat for Toronto Ultra, as the team was looking strong through the bracket. The squad was able to push LGD, Twisted, and ZETA out of the running, making it to the GF with relative ease – and that’s where it all came crashing down. Still, the squad walked away with a $160,000 prize, so it’s not <strong>all </strong>bad.</p>

<p>Spacestation has <span>dominated the entire HCS Atlanta Major, pulling off a memorable win and decimating all comers while dropping just&nbsp;<strong>two maps&nbsp;</strong>during the&nbsp;</span>tournament. On a grand stage in the Gateway Center Arena, the top HCS teams faced off for a $250,000 prize pot, but it was Spacestation that soared above the competition, skyrocketing to the grand final and walking clean through OpTic Gaming to secure the $100,000 prize.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-like-never-before">Like Never Before</h2>



<p>Spacestation is quickly becoming one of the best Halo teams ever – this past weekend proved that. Earlier this year, the team clutched up at the Arlington Major and beat OpTic in the grand final to secure another $100,000 prize – since then, the squad has also won a couple of Opens. This latest victory was massive, and Spacestation was in a flow state closing down the grand final against OpTic again.</p>



<p>Special commendations must be arranged for SSG’s Bound and StelluR – these players found their feet with white-hot momentum in the final series.</p>



<p>The loss came as a shock to OpTic Gaming fans worldwide. In the Pool Play stage, OpTic secured the same record as SSG but a defeat against Shopify in the Champs bracket pushed Team Green into the loser’s run. From there, the squad wiped FaZe and Pure, and got revenge against Shopify, coming into the GF with immense energy.</p>



<p>It just wasn’t enough to overcome SSG, which had charged through the Champs upper bracket at that point without dropping a single map.</p>



<p>Now, all eyes turn to the Salt Lake City Major, which will take place next month in Utah.</p>

This is the fifth set since Lorcana launched almost one year ago. Alongside a new expansive set, two starter decks will be released: An Emerald/Steel deck featuring The Lion King’s Scar and The Emperor’s New Groove’s Kronk, and an Amethyst/Ruby deck featuring Frozen’s Elsa and Wreck-It Ralph. Starter decks are always a good jumping-off point when getting into a new card game; these two new decks are no exception.</p><p>Starter decks usually have a theme, and the hope is that the included cards have a unifying playstyle. Usually, starter decks will get you part of the way to an optimized deck before players begin to brew some ideas. The Emerald/Steel deck, for instance, focuses on keeping your opponent's characters damaged throughout the game and capitalizing on that board state. The featured Scar character has an ability that allows the player to draw a card whenever one of their characters challenges a damaged character. Another example includes Scar’s hyena minion Ed, who is protected from being challenged if the opponent’s character is damaged. There’s even a location card, Tropical Rainforest, that forces opposing damaged characters to challenge if able. All of this disrupts the opposing player from playing their cards how they want to. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Disney Lorcana: Shimmering Skies Starter Decks</h3></div></output><p>And those are just some of the emerald cards in the deck. Regarding steel, there are some cards that can help with this overarching damaged character control strategy, like Tug-of-War, which gives the player a choice of dealing damage to all opposing characters with the Evasive ability or without, or Yzma, who can deal 1 damage to a character if any of the player’s characters banish another character through a challenge. This disruption deck is kind of interesting in the sense that you somewhat dictate how your opponent plays some of their cards if the setup is there. The only potential concern with this deck is that the player is leaving all of these opposing characters on the field. So if the player were to lose the ability to disrupt, all these surviving characters can now wreak havoc. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/0124-dlcs5-rrc-vanellopevonschweetz-randomrosterracer-en-733x1024-1721777132929.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>With the other available starter, the Amethyst/Ruby deck doesn’t synergize as much as its counterpart. The new Wreck-It Ralph characters Vanellope and Snowanna, for instance, have the rush ability to challenge opposing characters as soon as they are played, but don’t have a huge benefit like the current Amethyst/Ruby decks do when potentially trading characters in this way, such as drawing when banished. Sure, there are amethyst cards that exert characters to make them targets, but the rewards seem disappointing compared to what the new Emerald/Steel starter deck can pull off. With that said, there are just some good cards in the Amethyst/Ruby starter deck that players can most likely use in their own constructed decks. For example, The Sword Released is an item card that lets the player gain lore as well as force your opponent to lose lore if the player has the strongest character on the board. Another useful card is Finders Keepers, which lets the player draw three cards. Drawing and filtering the deck down is always useful when fishing for certain cards at pivotal moments in the match. Although the deck itself isn’t great on its own, the guaranteed cards can be useful in deck brewing if your options are limited. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...if the player were to lose the ability to disrupt, all these surviving characters can now wreak havoc.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Both Shimmering Skies starter decks, like other starters, continue to give players a pre-constructed taste of what their respective set will be like. We have new characters and abilities to mess around with, and that’s always exciting for any card game. Although one starter deck seemingly plays better, both work as a means to get into the game for those looking to try out the latest Disney Lorcana has to offer.

<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 is coming to PC Game Pass in the future. According to a new rumor from Tez2 on Twitter, Rockstar Games is getting GTA 5 ready for the service.</p>



<p>“Rockstar Games is preparing [GTA 5] to be playable via Xbox’s PC Game Pass for future availability,” <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1817699079876407495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he posted</a> to Twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used to be available</a> on Xbox Game Pass before it was removed earlier this year. It lasted just six months on the service before it was taken down. A reason for the game’s removal from the service was never provided after it happened. It was also removed from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog earlier this year.</p>



<p>There’s no mention in the rumor if GTA 5 would return to Xbox Game Pass for console owners. </p>







<p>Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify the GTA 5 to PC Game Pass rumor. Until that comes — or an official announcement is made — please take this rumor with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games is working on GTA 6, which is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. If you are hoping to play the latest GTA from Rockstar on PC when it releases, you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-about-not-announcing-gta-6-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going to have to wait</a> even longer.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-game-could-be-closer-than-you-think-hints-gearboxs-ceo-randy-pitchford/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-game-could-be-closer-than-you-think-hints-gearboxs-ceo-randy-pitchford/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox's CEO Randy Pitchford has revealed that the "next Borderlands title" is near getting its curtains pulled down and that fans won't have to wait long.</p>
<p>Pitchford, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-boss-says-fans-will-be-very-very-happy-with-the-next-video-game-and-were-not-going-to-be-making-people-wait-for-a-long-time-before-we-announce-it/">GamesRadar</a>, revealed that they are aware of the fact that fans are awaiting the next iteration of the franchise, which is why the studio won't take much time to announce plans for the future. Here is what he had to say:</p>
<p><em>I haven't been perfect at hiding the fact that we're working on many things, and that we're working on big things. I’m confident that our fans are going to be very, very happy with the next video game project when we are ready to announce it. And I will tell you that we’re not going to be making people wait for a long time before we announce it.</em></p>
<p>In terms of Borderlands in general, games got New Tales from the Borderlands back in 2022, along with the fantasy-focused Tiny Tina's Wonderlands; however, focusing on the main title, we have seen a massive five-year gap since the release of Borderlands 3 back in 2019. Rumors surrounding the next sequel, or Borderlands 4, did ignite when it was said that <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/">the title would be 2K Games' big Summer Game Fest reveal</a>, but later on, this rumor was refuted, putting the hype to a halt.</p>
<p>However, it looks like the newest statements by Pitchford have reclaimed our hopes in the franchise, and those who admired the "Wonderlands" universe should be pumped up as Pitchford has revealed that the next sequel will be built upon it, given how big of a hit it was.</p>
<p><em>We had a bigger result with the first Wonderlands game than we did with the first Borderlands game, so that's something we can build on. I love fantasy. That's why we did the original Dragon Keep DLC for Borderlands 2, because I love fantasy so much. </em></p>
<p><em>So many of us at Gearbox love fantasy, and it gives us that kind of place to to mess around with that in the context of the Borderlands themes and universe. I think it's reasonable for our fans to expect more there</em></p>
<p>Now, in terms of any hints surrounding the release date or maybe a showcase, Pitchford decided to hold the details, but he did see that fans wouldn't need to wait much. In the meanwhile, make sure to keep your eyes open for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands film</a>, which is set to debut in theaters by August 9th in the US.</p>

        <p>And you can watch it now for free on YouTube.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A year after its 22-hour-long documentary series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/double-fine-psychodyssey-is-a-20-hour-series-documenting-the-development-of-psychonauts-2">first debuted</a>, Double Fine has released an update to PsychOdyssey.</p>
<p>Running over 90 minutes long, the episode – subtitled "We Wrote it all Down" –  is the "direct continuation of the acclaimed series Double Fine Adventure, and offers even deeper insight into the passion, humour, and heartbreak of video game development".</p>
<p>The episode also chronicles the studio "reflecting on the launch of Psychonauts 2 and the PsychOdyssey documentary series while looking to the future and a return to smaller projects".</p>
<p>Best of all, like the original series, you can watch the entire thing for free on YouTube:</p>

<p>Calling the series "an unprecedented documentary experience nine years in the making", makers 2 Player Productions and Double Fine say: "Ten years after the successful release of their flagship video game Psychonauts, Double Fine Productions returns to its most celebrated franchise with Psychonauts 2.</p>
<p>"Now facing the pressure to produce a worthy sequel, the studio must confront overly ambitious designs, poor morale, technical challenges and financial woes, all during a turbulent span of time for the world."</p>
<p>Last year, Double Fine Productions founder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-schafer-joins-the-aias-hall-of-fame-at-the-upcoming-dice-awards">Tim Schafer was inducted into The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' (AIAS) Hall of Fame</a>. Schafer - best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, and Broken Age - was honoured at the 26th annual DICE event (not to be confused with EA's Stockholm studio of the same name).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-schafer-says-the-best-most-inclusive-games-are-never-based-on-stereotypes">Schafer recently revealed that he avoids "a grab bag of stereotypes"</a> to make his games more inclusive and avoid "hurting people".</p>

<p>Whilst Unknown Worlds is being, ahem, coi, eagle-eyed fans think they've discovered sneaky peeks of Subnautica 2 in the first (and currently only) game via its time capsule feature.</p>

<p>Originally it wasn't clear where these mysterious images were coming from, but moderators of the Subnautica subreddit have since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1e4vn00/comment/leuop67/">confirmed</a> "screenshot[s are] from the upcoming Subnautica 2" and not fan-made mods. </p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then,this has sent players back under the waves on the hunt for more.</p>
<p>Here's just a few of the images discovered so far:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Time is one of the great enemies of even the best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. It’s often hard enough to get a group of people together in the same space for a gaming session, doubly so if you need to find several hours to play the latest heavy, epic title. So there’s an instant market for faster-playing games. They’re also great for family play or for casually breaking out for a quick game before you head out for the evening. But as you’ll soon find out from our list of suggestions, small and fast doesn’t mean light or boring: from timer-based games to hilarious <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games">dexterity games</a>, you’ll soon discover that fast often equals fun. </p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Quick-Playing Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#scout">Scout</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#5-min-dungeon">5-Minute Dungeon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#fuse">Fuse</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#kites">Kites</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#klask">Klask</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#strike">Strike</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#sail">Sail!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#coup">Coup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#love-letter">Love Letter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#draftosaurus">Draftosaurus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#ticket">Ticket to Ride: London and New York</a></li></ul><h2 id="scout">Scout</h2><div id="195820" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scout</h3></p></div><p>Ignore the pointless circus theme; this is a fantastic little set collection card game with a devious twist: You can’t change the order of cards in your hand. Nevertheless, you have to work with what you’ve been dealt to try and beat whatever’s in the middle of the table, with higher value cards beating lower value, and longer runs and sets beating shorter ones. </p><p>If you can’t – as is often the case – the person who played those cards gets a point, and you have to pick a card up, making it easier for the next player and allowing you to slot it into your hand where you like, creating new combos for future plays. It’s fast, furious and surprisingly hard to master, with timing your best plays properly critical for success. No wonder it was a nominee for the prestigious <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiel des Jahres</a> award the year it was released. </p><h2 id="5-min-dungeon">5-Minute Dungeon</h2><div id="198563" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>5 Minute Dungeon</h3></p></div><p>One way to ensure a game is quick playing is to run it to an absolutely punishing timer, which is how 5-Minute Dungeon manages to do exactly what it says on the box. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">Build a deck</a> of dungeon challenges, pick a character, start the timer, and then it’s down to the adventuring party, working together, to defeat the dungeon in real-time. </p><p>Each trap or monster needs a particular set of symbols to banish, but you don’t have time to coordinate your plays properly, leading to a desperate slapping down of wasted cards, cries of woe, and forgetting of special character abilities in the heat of the moment. You’ll need to try and slow down just enough to chart a path through the chaos while still keeping up with the clock, and finding a moment to delight in the hilarious artwork and fantasy meme riffs. </p><h2 id="fuse">Fuse</h2><div id="198564" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Fuse</h3></p></div><p>Another timed game, this one sets the clock at 10 minutes, which your group must use to try and defuse as many bombs as possible from a deck of bomb cards. On your turn you’ll draw and roll as many dice, which come in different colors, as there are players, then discuss and divide them up while the timer ticks down. Each bomb card comes with a dizzying array of color and number requirements for dice to defuse it, from simple addition or equality to actually making stacks of dice in particular combinations. </p><p>The uncertainty of drawing and rolling never fails to give this game a thrilling edge, while probability ensures there’s some good strategy to doling out the dice. If you want to up the ante, there are some super-hard bombs to shuffle in for extra challenge.</p><h2 id="kites">Kites</h2><div id="198565" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kites - Time to Fly</h3></p></div><p>A whole different take on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> real-time mechanism, Kites comes with several sand timers of different lengths and colors, which represent different kites that you’ve got to keep in the air. On your turn, you play a card and flip any timers that match its colored icons. Your goal, as a group, is simply to stop any one of the timers from running out. </p><p>This is much easier said than done, and the game has an extraordinary spinning plates feeling as you desperately speed round the table, trying to flip timers trickling out their very last grains. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can add more colors and special challenge cards to keep your game in the air for longer, just like the titular kites.</p><h2 id="klask">Klask</h2><div id="197673" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Klask</h3></p></div><p>Possibly the shortest game on the entire list, with almost no setup time and games that can be over in seconds. But that’s no problem when it’s so addictive you’ll want to go again right away! Klask is a simple dexterity game where you use a magnet to steer a paddle that knocks a little plastic ball around the playing area, aiming to get it into your opponent’s goal while defending your own.</p><p>To add even more skill and amusement value to an already breakneck experience, there are also magnetic obstacles to avoid, lest they stick to your paddle and make your shots even more unpredictable. It’s such a fast, fun, fickle game that you’ll be using that short play time to host mini-tournaments.</p><h2 id="strike">Strike</h2><div id="198566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Strike Dice Game</h3></p></div><p>Strike is a fast-paced push-your-luck game that gets even faster the more players choose to tempt fate. Everyone starts with a fistful of dice and, on your turn, you throw one into the “arena”, an oval box insert, possibly aiming to knock existing dice there around. What you’re looking for are matching numbers, which you can add to your dice collection, ending your turn.</p><p>If you don’t get any matches, you can pass or continue throwing, which ups your chance of matching but also risks leaving more options for others if you don’t. Each dice has an X instead of a 1, meaning it’s removed from the game instantly, and the last player left with dice wins. It’s an addictive combination of luck, dexterity and playing the odds and once it’s reeled you in there are tournament rules for extended play.</p><h2 id="sail">Sail!</h2><div id="198567" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sail</h3></p></div><p>Most folks are familiar with the common playing card mechanic of trick-taking, which really helps this two-player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a> run faster. You’re working together to steer a pirate ship through dangerous seas, pursued by a hungry kraken. The symbols you pair on your trick might inch your craft forward, injure the sea monster, cause it to attack you, or do nothing at all. </p><p>But you’re not allowed to tell your shipmate what’s in your hand, only pass one card to them at the start of each turn, which has to try and speak volumes as to your plans. This makes every single play a mini-drama of tension and release in an overall arc of terror as you try to balance tricks won, movement and keeping the beast at bay. With six scenarios of punishing difficulty, this is a lot of game in a small box.</p><h2 id="coup">Coup</h2><div id="197941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Coup Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Bluffing on hidden roles is a great way to fit a lot of game into a small package, and Coup give you the biggest bluffing bang in the smallest box. Each player gets two role cards which give special powers like taking extra coins or cheap assassinations. The aim is to knock out your opponent’s roles, putting them out of the game. </p><p>The genius twist is that, whatever roles you're dealt, you can execute any power in the game, providing no-one catches you at it. Most roles have the chance to block one another, which is fine until it becomes clear that someone is claiming one they don't have. Then all hell breaks loose as the accusations start flying and no-one wants to be first to make the actual challenge. Because if you're wrong, it's you that looses out and not the target.</p><h2 id="love-letter">Love Letter</h2><div id="198214" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Love Letter</h3></p></div><p>Another bluffing game but with much more dynamic roles, Love Letter sees the players competing to get the titular epistle to the princess, who is also the highest-valued card. You start with a card and, on your turn, draw another and choose which to play. Each card has a number and a special effect, two of which knock other players out of the round based on whether you can either guess what card they’re holding or beat the value of that card against yours. </p><p>Other cards protect you, let you swap cards with another player or peek at their held card. The last two players left compare card values, and the highest wins. It’s a devious little game of social engineering, just like real courtly courtship, and while the rules suggest you play the superfast rounds multiple times to determine an overall winner, it’s also easily fun enough to play a single quick-fire hand.  </p><h2 id="draftosaurus">Draftosaurus</h2><div id="198568" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Draftosaurus</h3></p></div><p>Games of Draftosaurs begin with players grabbing a handful of dino-meeples – which are cute enough to justify owning this game on their own – at random from a bag. Then, you take it turns to roll the dice and place a dinosaur on your dino-zoo playmat. The dice-roller can place where they want, but all other players have to obey the rule on the dice face. There are a number of different enclosures, each with their own simple placement rules and scoring opportunities. Then, everyone passes the remaining dinosaurs to your left and repeat until all the pieces have been placed, and the scores tallied to find a winner.</p><p>The combination of random roll and passing on gives the game some interesting teeth as you ponder whether to risk pieces in higher-scoring options or keep back something your neighbor is collecting. Easy to learn and fast to play, it’s a quick filler that can easily end up being popular enough to play all evening.</p><h2 id="ticket">Ticket to Ride: London / New York</h2><div id="198569" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride London</h3></p></div><div id="198570" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride New York</h3></p></div><p>The enormously successful Ticket to Ride franchise is based on players collecting sets of colored cards and playing them to claim routes on a map.  Most of your points come from tickets that you score if you connect their printed destinations, but fail to complete the route, and you’ll lose those points instead. </p><p>It’s a brilliant recipe that forces you to balance the desire to collect against the risk of other players slapping down the cards before you. These two variants keep that addictive core gameplay loop, but make it quick by giving you only a tiny, cramped board to play on, leaving you feeling like you’re scuffling in a phone booth. Each has its own unique twist to the recipe, with London offering bonus points for completing districts and New York for linking up tourist hotspots. </p><h2>How to Speed Up Slower Games</h2><p>Medium-length games can become quick-playing games with a few house rules, or tweaks to your setup and your play style, although all the players will have to be on board with the changes, and you’ll need to go through it with them beforehand. Here are some hints on places you can make up time.</p><p>Firstly, you can mimic what a lot of the games on this list already do and add a timer, limiting the amount of time a player has to complete their turn. Some people will absolutely hate this, but others won’t mind, and a few will even thrive in the pressure cooker environment that results. This is a particularly good trick for games that have a negotiation element, as the timer ups the skill required to communicate your deals as concisely as possible.</p><p>A surprising number of games are also amenable to turn overlap, especially ones that have limited player interaction. While one player is collecting the resources earned during their turn, for example, the next player can begin working on theirs. You can overlap at any point of the turn where parts of the game that might impact the next player - like cards available in a market, say - aren’t changing. In low-interaction games, that can be a surprising amount of time saved.</p><p>Finally, it can also help to ban mobile devices, and even things like pencils and paper, at the table. This ensures everyone is focussed on what needs to be done in the game at all times, not spending time taking notes, or - worse - scrolling social media, and can actually improve the atmosphere and sociability around the game. And if you can’t do that, you can consider embracing it and playing online instead, using a service like <u>BoardGameArena</u> to take care of all that painstaking setup and administration time for you.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-took-this-long-because-bioware-wanted-to-get-it-right-game-has-700-characters.939033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-took-this-long-because-bioware-wanted-to-get-it-right-game-has-700-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>BioWare attended San Diego Comic-Con 2024 to discuss <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and showcase the voice actors chosen for the upcoming action RPG.</p>
<p>While there, Creative Director John Epler and Creative Performance Director Ashley Barlow spoke briefly to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilgaurd-took-so-long-as-bioware-wanted-to-make-sure-we-got-this-one-right-that-and-it-takes-a-long-time-to-record-700-characters-and-140000-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamesradar</a>. Epler explained why Dragon Age: The Veilguard took so long to make:</p>
<p><em>We had other projects going on at BioWare as well. We wanted to make sure we got this one right. It's the best version that it could possibly be.</em></p>
<p>Ashley Barlow added:</p>
<p><em>We started casting five years ago. The team, the talent has been on for five years. It takes a long time to record 700 characters, you know - 80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks. It just takes time to make good.</em></p>
<p>That's a lot of characters, but some of them will probably have only one or two voice lines. Overall, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will have more voice lines than its predecessor (2014's Inquisition), which had 88K, but still way less than other games. Red Dead Redemption 2 had over 500K voice lines, and Starfield had over 250K. Larian never provided a fixed number for Baldur's Gate 3, but it's a safe bet that it has way more voice lines, considering that there are over 140 hours of cutscenes and around 1.3 million words in the award-winning cRPG.</p>
<p>In another video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S94JyK-F8KA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with The Gamer</a>, John Epler discussed whether reading comics and novels is necessary before playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><em>One of the things we do try to make sure with the games is that you don't need to have consumed all the ancillary content to understand what's going on. Still, there's characters from the comics, especially The Missing, the most recent one, that show up in the game. One is a pair of characters we've talked about before, Evka Ivo and Antoine, two Grey Wardens. In general, we just love to make sure that there's a continuity. Again, if you don't read the comics or the books, you still know what's going on, but if you do, it gives you that extra level of texture. Honestly, the same is true even for the previous games. We want to make sure that if you play the previous games you get that extra context, that extra texture, but also we want to allow players who don't necessarily consume all that ancillary media to really get into the story of the game and understand what's going on.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't be shown at Gamescom 2024</a>. Despite the absence, according to EA, the game is still slated for a Fall 2024 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

        <p>"I can't wait to talk about the stuff that we're working on with our fans," says Pitchford.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford says news about the next game in the Borderlands series will come "sooner rather than later".</p>
<p>Gearbox – which is now a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">subsidiary of Take-Two</a> after being sold by Embracer last year – hasn't yet confirmed another Borderlands game is on the way, but Pitchford says he hasn't "done a good enough job of hiding the fact that we're working on something [...] and [he] thinks people that love Borderlands are going to be very excited".</p>

<p>"Oh man, I don't think I've done a good enough job of hiding the fact that we're working on something," Pitchford told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-new-game-announcement-coming-soon-randy-pitchford/">TheGamer</a>. "And I think people that love Borderlands are going to be very excited about what we're working on.</p>
<p>"These are fuzzy words, but sooner rather than later, we're going to be talking about what we've been working on, and I can't wait.</p>
<p>"I think I'm genetically made to try and create joy and happiness, and build entertainment. I love movies and I love video games, I love entertainment," he added.</p>
<p>"So I'm grateful that we have so many great things coming with Borderlands, and I can't wait to talk about the stuff that we're working on with our fans."</p>
<p>The Borderlands movie - which Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has, perhaps prematurely, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-start-of-cinematic-universe-randy-pitchford-says">the start of a "Borderlands Cinematic Universe"</a> - sees Cate Blanchett's infamous outlaw Lillith returning to the planet Pandora in search of a missing girl. Along the way she teams up with former mercenary Roland (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kevin-hart-to-play-roland-in-borderlands-movie">Kevin Hart</a>), pre-teen demolitionist Tiny Tina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/young-gamora-actress-to-play-tiny-tina-in-borderlands-movie">Ariana Greenblatt</a>), her protector Krieg (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/florian-munteanu-viktor-drago-in-creed-2-is-krieg-in-the-borderlands-movie">Florian Munteanu</a>), Padorian archaeologist Tannis (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>), and robot Claptrap (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a>), uncovering an "unimaginable power".</p>
