That includes <em>Legacy of the Moonspell</em>, <em>Tides of the Foscari</em>, <em>Emergency Meeting</em>, and April’s <em>Operation Guns </em>which added a <em>Contra </em>crossover. The base game is $5 and all of the DLC combined is an additional $9. Plus there are all of the free updates that have added all sorts of other characters and easter eggs. </p><p>Why did it take this long? Poncle, a tiny indie team, has been taking its time with ports, working on one console a year. While Microsoft was on the ball with an Xbox version shortly after the 2022 PC release, Vampire Survivors didn’t come to Nintendo Switch until a year later, with a fantastic free mobile version taking precedence early on. Poncle blamed the more recent holdup on Sony’s submission process, noting that the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had never put a game on the PlayStation store before</a></span>.</p><p>In the meantime, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> has spawned dozens of worthy clones, copycats, and clever adaptations.

Like <em>Slay the Spire </em>before it, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> seems to hit on something archetypal that elevates its mashup of mechanics into its own subgenre.</p><p>It’s nice that PlayStation owners will finally be able to see what all the fuss is about.

It can be tough looking for a starting point but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered!</p><h2>D&amp;D: What You Need To Know</h2><p>Getting into Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) can be overwhelming; there are so many campaigns and thousands with an encyclopedic mind about all things D&amp;D. We've got you; here's a simple guide to help you get started on your epic journey. </p><p>Begin by grasping the game's fundamental concepts and gathering the essential materials. Once you understand the core mechanics, you can dive into character creation and start playing with a group of friends. Here's how to get started:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Understand the Basics</strong>: D&amp;D is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) in which players create characters and embark on adventures in a fantasy world. The game is typically played with a Dungeon Master (DM) who narrates the story and controls the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters.</li><li><strong>Get the Core Rulebooks</strong>: You'll need the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0PDE5?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u><em>Player's Handbook</em></u><u>, </u><u><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></u><u>, and </u><u><em>Monster Manual</em></u><u>.</u></a> These books provide all the rules and lore necessary to create characters, run adventures, and understand the game's mechanics.</li><li><strong>Join a Group</strong>: Find a group of friends who are interested in playing or joining an existing group. If you need help finding a local group, online platforms like <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roll20</u></a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord </u></a>can help you connect with other players.</li><li><strong>Create Your Character</strong>: Use the <em>Player's Handbook</em> to create your first character. Think of the Player's race, class, background, and personality. This is your chance to get creative and make someone you'd enjoy playing.</li><li><strong>Start With a Simple Adventure</strong>: Beginners should start with a pre-written adventure. <em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> is an excellent choice for new players and DMs. It offers a balanced introduction to D&amp;D gameplay and storytelling.</li></ol><h3><strong>Choosing the Right Miniatures</strong></h3><p>Miniatures add a visual and tactile element to D&amp;D, making battles and encounters more immersive. Selecting the right miniatures enhances the gameplay experience, offering a tangible representation of characters, monsters, and environments. Here's a guide on what to buy to get the most out of your D&amp;D sessions:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Player Characters (PCs)</strong>: Invest in a miniature representing your character. Companies like <a href="https://zdcs.link/W0kgN?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>WizKids</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRqVD?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Reaper Miniatures</u></a> offer a wide range of detailed minis for various races and classes. Look for miniatures that match your character's description.</li><li><strong>Monsters and NPCs</strong>: Start with basic monsters commonly encountered in early levels, such as goblins, skeletons, and wolves.</li><li><strong>Special Sets</strong>: Consider themed sets that correspond with your campaign. For instance, if your adventure takes place in an Underdark setting, look for miniatures of <a href="https://zdcs.link/lV04O?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>drow</u></a>, mind flayers, and other <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVrWq?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>underworld creatures</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Terrain and Accessories</strong>: Enhance your game with terrain pieces like trees, buildings, and dungeon tiles.

Consider getting a dice tower or tray to keep the rolls contained.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/71VqV?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u><strong>Miniatures</strong></u></a>: As mentioned, invest in miniatures for player characters and commonly encountered monsters.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/weMny?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u><strong>Battle Map and Markers</strong></u></a>: A grid-based map (often erasable) and markers to visualize combat and positioning.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eBMM?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u><strong>Adventure Modules</strong></u><u>:</u></a> Pre-written adventures for easy setup and play, or create your own!</li></ol><h3><strong>Different Types of D&amp;D Game Modes</strong></h3><p>D&amp;D can be played in various modes, each offering a different style of play and experience. Understanding these modes can help you decide which type suits your group best. Here are some standard game modes:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Campaign Play</strong> is the traditional mode in which players embark on a long-term adventure, progressing their characters over many sessions. It requires a consistent group and a dedicated DM to manage the story and progression.</li><li><strong>One-Shots</strong>: These are single-session adventures that can be completed in a few hours. They are great for introducing new players to the game or playing when a regular campaign session is impossible.</li><li><strong>Skirmishes</strong>: These combat-focused sessions emphasize tactical battles rather than stories. Players can quickly set up scenarios and engage in fighting, making them a good choice for those who enjoy the combat mechanics of D&amp;D.</li><li><strong>West Marches</strong> is a style of play in which multiple DMs and a large pool of players participate in a shared world. Sessions are player-driven, and the world evolves based on the actions and discoveries of different groups.</li><li><strong>Solo Play</strong>: While D&amp;D is typically a group game, solo adventures and modules are available for players who want to experience the game independently.</li></ol><h3><strong>Final Tips</strong></h3><p>Getting into D&amp;D is more than just the game; it's about spending time with the community, sharing stories, and having fun. Start small, engage with others, and most importantly, enjoy the process. The journey is as much about the experiences and memories you create along the way as about the adventures your character embarks on. Here are some final tips to help you along:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Start Small</strong>: You don't need to buy anything all at once. Begin with the essentials and gradually expand your collection.</li><li><strong>Join Online Communities</strong>: Engage with other D&amp;D enthusiasts on forums such as <a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Myth Weavers</u></a>, social media, and websites like<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> D&amp;D Beyond</u></a>. These communities are great for tips, inspiration, and support.</li><li><strong>Have Fun</strong>: Remember, D&amp;D is about storytelling, creativity, and having fun with friends. Don't stress too much about the rules or perfection—just enjoy the adventure!</li></ul></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 8, 2024 1:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There have been all sorts of Fortnite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-item-shop-wont-stop-being-weird/1100-6520635/" data-ref-id="1100-6520635">item-shop anomalies</a> over the past year and a half, but things have gotten exceptionally weird lately. We're about a week away from a new season, but every Fortnite diehard has their focus on the same thing today: the item shop. The news that items and skins from future battle passes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">will be eligible to be sold in the shop</a> starting 18 months after the end of each season is just the capper (so far) on a week in which the item shop simply refused to be normal. Following months of the item shop seeming unhinged and uncontrollable, this week has given us our most surprising item shop gaffes yet.</p><p>Let's run down the current strangeness. Last week, the item shop briefly sold a jam track from last season's battle pass in the shop, before Epic hid it from the shop and forced refunds to those who purchased it. Also last week, every item in the shop claimed it was leaving on August 6, even though items in the shop never rotate in or out as one collective like that. After that didn't happen, everything shifted to saying it would rotate out on August 13, which is just as untrue.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Fall Guys Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The most significant goof of them all came this past Tuesday; Epic accidentally sold The Paradigm skin for the first time since it was released in 2019--despite the fact that it was advertised and sold back then as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?id=100064597183531&amp;story_fbid=2844969895580316&amp;_rdr">an exclusive release</a> timed to the Season X finale event. It was intended to never be sold again. For Fortnite's most diehard digital collectors, to say the surprise was monumental would be a dramatic understatement--it was, honestly, as much of a shocker as the change to battle pass exclusivity would be 12 hours later, and it kicked off a pretty bizarre evening.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4346820-fortnitetheparadigm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346820" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4346820-fortnitetheparadigm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346820"></a><figcaption>The original Paradigm skin from Fortnite Season X.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4346820-fortnitetheparadigm.jpg"></figure><p>Epic's first response to the accident was to remove The Paradigm from the item shop after an hour without any comment on the situation. An hour after that, Epic declared that it would, as with the Swim Free jam track from the Chapter 5 Season 2 battle pass popping up in the shop last week, be refunding new buyers and <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1821001329042493935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing the skin from their lockers</a>. Another hour later, Epic reversed course and declared that anyone who purchased The Paradigm during its brief return window would be refunded <em>and also</em> get to keep the skin.</p><p>Those who had it back in the day will get a new, exclusive alternate style to prove their status as an OG, as well as a new option to refund their purchase from half a decade ago, just in case some players are annoyed by the fact that the item's rarity has unexpectedly changed in an instant.</p><p>So yes, that's right: If you were among those who scrambled to buy The Paradigm on Tuesday, you're getting it for free; you should receive a refund in V-Bucks within a few days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1821024926150881445" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Change of plan! Bought The Paradigm tonight? You can keep her!<br>Her accidental return to the Shop is on us... so if you purchased The Paradigm during this evening's rotation, you can keep this Outfit and we'll refund your V-Bucks soon-ish.<br>We plan to create a brand new variant…</p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1821024926150881445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The response from the community to all of this was immediately vociferous. About four hours after the shop reset, the top six topics on the Fortnite subreddit were about The Paradigm and how Epic had handled the situation. Because the skin was so rare and important to the Fortnite storyline in the past, lots of folks had been waiting a very long time to purchase it--Fortnite previously included a Brie Larson version of this character in the Chapter 3 Season 4 battle pass as an alternative. At the same time, a lot of players who had The Paradigm originally were angry that the skin was available again after it had been sold to them as an exclusive--some of those people had undoubtedly only bought it because of that alleged exclusivity.</p><p>While the inclusion of The Paradigm in the shop was seemingly an error, it was one that actually required some effort. The Fortnite item shop looks extremely different than it did in 2019. Presumably, all the shop assets related to The Paradigm would have had to be updated by an actual person to meet the current item shop's aesthetic standards.</p><p>Epic's decision to both give new purchasers their V-Bucks back and allow them to keep the skin is likely a consequence of a lot of people spending real human currency on V-Bucks to buy it. It's no exaggeration to say there are people who have been checking the item shop daily for <em>years</em> for exactly this moment, despite having no reason to think it would ever actually happen. This is in <em>sharp</em> contrast with the Swim Free jam track, which carried no demand whatsoever since it was available for free to anyone who played Fortnite during last season.</p><p>So while Epic can unilaterally issue V-Buck refunds for these purchases, the real-money purchases to obtain those V-Bucks would still need to be addressed, and that's a far more complicated thing with platform holders like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo having to be involved. Giving buyers their V-Bucks back and also letting them keep the purchase is the path of least resistance--and it builds a little goodwill among some of Fortnite's most hardcore users in the process. But it also once again demonstrates how oddly out-of-control the Fortnite item shop continues to be month after month, or even day after day at some points over the last year and change.</p><p>From the outside, all this remains a confusing--and admittedly somewhat amusing--mystery. The shop doesn't have a mind of its own, so why does the system that operates the digital store seem so indecipherable to its creators? Suppose Epic doesn't intend to sell a particular item. How does it keep happening that for periods of minutes or days at a time, several times dating back for more than a year now, such items keep becoming available for purchase? The financial cost of these mistakes may prove to be a mere rounding error for the video game giant, but the reputational cost is arguably more severe by routinely frustrating and/or confusing the game's most dedicated players. Also, consider this sort of thing probably doesn't look great to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">government agencies</a> and regulatory bodies that have already been scrutinizing Fortnite's item shop practices for years.</p><p>This whole ordeal with The Paradigm also demonstrates why Epic is only planning to bring back items from future battle passes and not the current and old ones--beyond just the myriad potential legal issues doing so might create. The uproar about The Paradigm was immense despite the fact that, realistically, few people actually owned it. Battle pass skins, by extreme contrast, are <em>the </em>most commonly owned skins, and so there would be far more people who actually cared about whether they come back--the fighting about it would never end. It's just a mess Epic doesn't need to step in right now. So for the foreseeable future, do-overs, like the current Deadpool and Wolverine shop skins, will continue to be the way Epic creatively brings back battle pass items.</p><p>We'll keep monitoring the enigmatic Fortnite item shop for accidental re-releases, regrettable refunds, and other head-scratching items for sale.</p>

		<p>Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment have shared an extended multiplayer gameplay video for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, showcasing the 3-player PvE Operations, and the PvP Eternal War mode. Space Marine 2 is coming out across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 9th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Extended Multiplayer Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moaWKtTq1zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking place on Planet Kadaku, the mission sends the team out to reach a refinery and use its stores to destroy the swarm of Tyranid aliens. Right from the off, you get to see a motley selection of Space Marine gear, with jump packs, Power Hammers, Power Swords, shields, scoped Bolters and more, taking on Tyranids big and swarmy – the Carnifex battle gives off some Monster Hunter vibes, to me.</p>
<p>The action then jumps to PvP competitive multiplayer, with 4v4 battles between Space Marines and Chaos Marines – there’s sure to be plenty of fun character customisation options there. The game mode shown here was Capture and Control.</p>
<p>Both modes feature six playable classes – Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy – and lean in on a customisation system for your own Space Marine. It’s not just cosmetics, but will let you level up your weapons through play with a shared progression system. After launch, Saber will roll out content updates to add more Operations missions, PvP maps, weapons and more.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s main story campaign will see the Ultramarines and Captain Demetrian Titus (now demoted to Lieutenant after the original game) stepping into the breach to face off against the Tyranid hordes invading the Imperial worlds of Avarax and Kadaku. While he might have been demoted, Titus has undergone the Rubicon Primaris process to transform him into a taller, stronger and faster Primaris Space Marine – a relatively new narrative twist in the 42nd millenium, after the return of the Primarchs.</p>
<p>Dom got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preview-better-the-boltgun-you-know/">hands on with Space Marine 2 back at Gamescom last year</a>, writing “Combat in Space Marine 2 is unapologetically gritty, focussing on the risk and reward of executions to renew your ability bank. Blood flies out of everywhere, which is little surprise when the Space Marines are packing swords with chainsaws built in and boltguns with ammo the size of your fist. There’s a cool parry move to utilise, and you have to mix up your approaches as you deal with ever-larger Tyranid enemies. They behave as you’d expect, like a flood of alien locusts that swarm towards you, intent on turning you to mulch. Better you do it to them first, then!”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enshrouded-sales-cross-3-million-as-devs-share-some-fun-statistics.948069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-3-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keen Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>sales have topped another big milestone since the game's Early Access release in January, and the devs have also shared some interesting statistics about the game to celebrate.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has hit three million sales. As a reminder, the game managed to reach the million-player mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-million-players">in only four days</a>, reaching two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-two-million-players">less than a month</a> after its release.</p>
<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>may not be attracting as many players as it did during the peak of its popularity, but it's still drawing around 10,000 players per day <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1203620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to SteamDB</a>, which isn't bad going at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-sales-3-million-combat.jpg?itok=3cZZ9Moj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-sales-3-million-combat.jpg?itok=wsHXFYlX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has cracked the three million sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've been playing&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>- or even if you haven't, and you're just interested in its progress - then you may like to know that Keen Games has also released some fun stats about the game.</p>
<p>According to the devs, more than 90 million hours of&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>have been played so far, and in those 90 million hours, 150 million player deaths have been registered. Ouch.</p>
<p>Almost 700,000 players have reached&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>'s level cap of 25, and since development on the game began, Keen Games has doubled in size, with its longest-standing employee having been with the company for 19 years. Now that's service!</p>
<p>Three major content updates have been implemented since&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>'s launch: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls">Hollow Halls</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-melodies-of-mire-update">Melodies of the Mire</a>, and Back to the Shroud. There's much more to come as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-roadmap-2024">the game's roadmap</a>, too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you (and, optionally, your friends) venture into the deadly Shroud in order to gather resources, battle powerful enemies, and carve out a life for yourself.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently in Early Access. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

			<p>Crytek has announced the addition of a new Wild Target coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-out-now-hunt-showdown-1896-gets-dlss-level-zero-extraction-launches-with-dlss-3/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>, which will be added to the game alongside a new event called Scorched Earth. This new Wild Target and event will both be available to players on August 15, launching on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The Hellborn can be found lurking around the peaks of the new Colorado map, Mammon's Gulch. In addition to the Hellborn, Scorched Earth includes three Pacts for Hunters to pledge to as they make their way into the depths of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Hellborn are a source of immense heat, and can be tracked down audibly by listening in Dark Sight. For those on the lookout for this new Wild Target they can be found at multiple locations. However, they are a considerable threat to players, as they can cover the Hunters in slag, scorching everything in its wake. In addition, the Hellborn howls incredibly loud, which attracts the attention of many other Hunters, meaning you have some additional threat to contend with.</p>
<p>Along with the new Wild Target for players to hunt down, the Scorched Earth event for Hunt: Showdown 1896 also brings new ammo and weapons. This includes the 1865 Carbine, the Infantry 73L base rifle with a sniper variant, Bear Trap and a Crossbow Deadeye scoped variant.</p>
<p>A new Weekly Challenge system has been implemented to support players who join in the Scorched Earth event in the middle of it, as well as a Battle Pass which includes free and premium rewards for players to unlock.</p>
<p>There are three Pacts that Hunters can take in the Hunt: Showdown 1896 Scorched Earth event. The first pact is The Lawful Pact. This is to try and establish Hunter authority in the Gulch under Wyatt Preston's command.</p>
<p>Second is The Wilderness Pact, where Hunters don't trust in the law to any degree. Instead, they stay out in the wilderness to defend the sanctity of the mountain ranges, while punishing those who try to exploit it.</p>
<p>Third and finally, there is The Demented Pact, which resurfaces under the veil of darkness, following signs of Corruption. Hunters who take this Pact seek to nurture and multiple the wonders that the Sculptor has wrought.</p>
<p>Each Pact comes with its own traits that can make it beneficial to a Hunter. Players can pledge to their Pacts at Supply Points, which gives them exclusive Pact-specific Traits. In addition, some existing Traits gain bonus Conditional Traits for those who pledge to specific Pacts.</p>
<p>The trailer for the Scorched Earth event and the Hellborn Wild Target is now available to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiO-DVP8AGg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch on YouTube</a>.</p>

The first game played a lot like a traditional BioWare <em>D&amp;D </em>game, despite being set in the company’s self-created universe. You could take control of any member of your party, and pause battles to possess each and decide on their next moves. By the third game, <em>Inquisition</em>, while you could still control other characters, the emphasis had moved much more toward focusing on your main, and much more on the action. It seems that transition is now complete.</p><p>Talking to <em>Edge</em>, BioWare’s Corianna Busch told the magazine, “On the experiential side, we wanted you to feel like you are Rook.” That’s the pre-determined main character of <em>Veilguard</em>, albeit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-options-races-1851564939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-options-races-1851564939">one you can design to look how you wish</a></span>. “You’re in this world, you’re really focused on your actions,” the game’s director continued. “We wanted the companions to feel like they, as fully realised characters, are in control of their own actions. They make their own decisions.”</p><p>However, that’s not the only reason. (And wouldn’t be the best one, given how much I’ve bonded with my own character in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, to the degree where it just felt <em>wrong</em> to be playing as one of the companions.) Busch also told the UK magazine that <em>Veilguard</em> “is a much higher actions-per-minute game. It is more technically demanding on the player.” Apparently during playtesting, it was found that letting people control the companions “wasn’t actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144">From the early footage</a></span>, it’s pretty clear that <em>Veilguard</em> is a full-on third-person action game, on top of being an RPG. Which we’re totally down for. But it’s certainly going to be a cognitive shift, losing the ability to direct companion actions—let’s just hope their AI is up to it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Splitgate 2, the upcoming free-to-play team-based shooter, has finally gotten a full gameplay reveal ahead of its first Alpha later this month.</p>



<p>In the gameplay reveal, players get a look how the combat will work in the game along with the overall visuals. Also shown throughout the reveal are the new factions that debut in Splitgate 2.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>There are three factions in total, each having their own abilities to help vary the game’s playstyle. The Aeros faction are a fast-paced group with a Rush ability that allows for more agile movement on the map. The Meridian faction offers Hypersight and Time Dome systems that “give a huge boost to support class players, arming them with the ability to assist the whole team”.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Sabrask faction is known as the “toughest” in the game. </p>



<p>“The Sabrask Smart Wall is truly advantageous in a head-to-head gun fight and combined with a few perfectly thrown grenades, this faction can have powerful offensive potential in controlling an area,” developer 1047 Games said.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 is scheduled to launch in 2025, and will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

<p>Roblox has officially been banned in Turkey (Türkiye) over concerns of child exploitation.</p>



<p>In a statement posted on <a href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter on Wednesday</a>, Minister of Justice Yılmaz Tunç said that access to the game “and its links” have been blocked.</p>



<p>“It is everyone’s duty to look out for, protect and support the best interests of our children, the guarantor of our future,” he said. “Turkey is one of the countries that closely follows developments in the world and uses technology in the best way. However, using technology in a negative way is never acceptable.”</p>



<p>No other reasons, or further explanation, were given for the game’s ban in the country.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-s-response-to-being-banned">Roblox’s Response To Being Banned</h2>



<p>In response to the ban in Turkey, Roblox says that it respects the laws in countries it operates in.</p>



<p>“We’ve spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do,” the company said in a statement. </p>



<p>“We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers’ commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time child exploitation has been brought up against Roblox. Just last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg published a story</a> on how the company has been fighting a — sometimes losing — battle against child predators within its game.</p>

<p>Three weeks after its release, EA Sports College Football 25 has received its first major title update. The 4.2 GB update includes a number of fixes to the game’s simulation logic, gameplay, schools, and much more.</p>



<p>One of the bigger changes comes in the form of a fix to the “scheduling visit” bug with recruiting that wouldn’t allow you to schedule visits with recruits after they finalized their Top 5 schools. Also fixed is the sim logic and rankings that determine what schools make the Top 25 and College Football Playoffs. </p>



<p>One thing that didn’t appear to change with the College Football 25 title update is the ability to change player numbers for generated generic recruits. It’s something players have been vocal about being able to do across social media, but hasn’t been addressed just yet. There’s also no confirmation from EA on if they will address it at all.</p>



<p>Check out the full list of changes to the game from the College Football 25 title update below <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-campus-huddle-title-update-august-8th-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via EA Sports</a>. And be sure to let us know your thoughts on the update in the comments.</p>

<p>The Borderlands movie hits theaters on Friday, August 9 but critics have already come out with their reviews of the movie, and it’s not good. In fact, it’s pretty much consensus at this point that everyone who’s watched the Borderlands movie hates it. </p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the movie currently sits with a 0 rating. You read that right, 0 out of 100.</p>



<p>Based on 14 critic scores so far, Borderlands is being panned as being <a href="https://x.com/SmatthewAF/status/1821056580751913225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“uninspiring”</a>, “lifeless”, and even a <a href="https://x.com/AdriCaporusso/status/1821041077018882518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“disaster”</a>.</p>







<p>“Filled with every cliché you can ponder, this film swaps the mayhem and imagination of the games for a lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud with annoying characters and a cast with not one ounce of chemistry,” Adriano Caporusso of Bitesize Breakdown said.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-b2592670.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clarisse Loughrey</a> of the Independent said that the movie has “dragged us back to a time when studios used to make these with all the grace and acuity of a drunk person attempting to place a 3am chicken nugget order.”</p>



<p>While there are certain to be some that do find the movie starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Blatt funny or entertaining, it seems as though they’ll be in the minority. Earlier this year, Randy Pitchford said that the first movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-cinematic-universe-first-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “beginning” of the Borderlands cinematic universe</a>. If the movie struggles at the box office as much as it has with critics, there may not be a universe to explore.</p>



<p>Only time will tell what the future holds for the franchise.</p>

The presentation is of interest for Fortnite fans because it will delve into some of the details about what kind of stuff Disney plans to do within Fortnite in the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4347511-peelverinebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347511" data-ratio="0.56253270538985" data-width="1911" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4347511-peelverinebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347511"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at the free Peelverine back bling.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4347511-peelverinebackbling.jpg"></figure><p>The livestream will be viewable in the Disney Horizons Live from D23 creative island (island code: 7908-6413-2516), which will become available at 7:30 PM PT/10:30 PM ET on Saturday, an hour before the stream begins. After the presentation is over, it will play on a loop until August 16. All you have to do to earn the Peelverine back bling is hang out in the island for 10 minutes at any point during that span of time, so you don't even have to watch the whole thing if you don't want to.</p><p>We don't know anything at all for sure about what will be revealed, but the new Fortnite season begins next week and has long been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-start-date-leaks-and-rumors/2900-5569/" data-ref-id="2900-5569">rumored to be a new Marvel-focused one</a>--that's something that would make a lot of sense to announce during this presentation, particularly since they'll be looping the stream until the new season begins next Friday. So there's a very good chance that the D23 Horizons presentation actually is going to be very worth watching.</p>
