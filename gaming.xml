            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has hit a big sales milestone, and the game managed to achieve said milestone in just a few days.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001019.000050711.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;managed to rack up a million sales by October 11th, which is just three days after the game's launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The fact that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is a console exclusive, with an Xbox port <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around a year away at least</a>, arguably makes that milestone more impressive. Here's hoping this leads Konami to think about making more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>games in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=75oyakmx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=QJxWSG76 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pyramid Head wants to know if you've gone out and bought&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The one million figure combines physical shipments and digital sales, although Konami doesn't say how those two are weighted, so we don't know whether the digital or physical version of the game has proven more popular.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the 2001 survival horror classic developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team.</p>
<p>Although it remains fairly faithful to the original game's story, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake shifts the action to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>-style over-the-shoulder perspective and expands the world too, allowing you to explore more areas of the titular town.</p>
<p>Naturally, the visuals and overall presentation have been improved as well, and the remake also adds new cutscenes to expand the story a little, so this is a more substantial remake than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed"><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em></a>, for instance.</p>

<p>It's a good time for remakes of survival horror classics from the 2000s. Yesterday, Capcom announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m">surpassed eight million sales</a>, a pretty impressive figure in itself (although one that still pales in comparison to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">mighty&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>).</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-ops-6-cross-platform-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 is 2024’s Call of Duty release, and it has been a long time coming. Activision has put a lot of money and effort into producing and marketing this stellar title, and fans worldwide were excited about it from the moment the first trailers aired. In this modern, ever-connected world, gamers everywhere have one key question: ‘Is Black Ops 6 cross-platform?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-crossplay">Is Black Ops 6 Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6, like every Call of Duty game since 2019, is fully cross-platform compatible. That means that if you have a PlayStation 5, nothing is stopping you from joining forces with your friends, even if one is on Xbox Series X and the other is on PC. </p>



<p>Modern Call of Duty games are linked more by a centralised Activision-backed account system than they are by individual platform identity networks. That means that regardless of your platform, you’ll be matched up with players on other formats. That of course does bring about a fair share of problems.</p>



<p>It means as a console player, you could be matched with PC players – and some gamers <strong>fear that</strong>. It’s no big secret that PC players have access to more sophisticated cheats, which is a massive issue with the Call of Duty ecosystem.</p>



<p>But fear not – you can <strong>turn off crossplay in Black Ops 6</strong> in the in-game menu. That’ll lock you to matchmaking exclusively with others on your format of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-cross-progression">Is Black Ops 6 Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>As Call of Duty accounts link up across platforms, you’ll be able to enjoy unhindered cross-progression elements on Black Ops 6. That means that if you have the game on PC and want to switch over to a PlayStation 5 copy, nothing is stopping you from logging in on the other device, recovering your process, and carrying on where you left off.</p>



<p>It’s a neat and seamless system that players love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-age-of-heroes-begins-today-adding-voiced-companions-and-living-player-settlements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom might be busy working on Dune Awakening ahead of the game's planned <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2025 launch on PC</a>, but Conan Exiles is still going strong and receiving updates, too. Today, the developer has released Chapter 1 of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-introduces-fully-voiced-companions-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Heroes season of updates</a>.</p>
<p>The main additions are two fully-voiced companions, the sorcerer Liu Fei and the Aesir warrior Freya. Liu Fei is reportedly trapped somewhere among humanoid grey apes, and Funcom warns players to carefully hear his story before deciding whether to add him as a companion.</p>
<p>Freya, on the other hand, can be found on a high peak surrounding the Northern Aqueduct. A bloodthirsty desire for vengeance is the backdrop to this adventure, and it's up to the player to lead or be led by Freya.&nbsp;Both Liu Fei and Freya have their own perks, abilities, and powers, and Funcom teased they'll be a consequence of the choices made by players during the respective companion quests.</p>
<p>Once you have recruited them, you can examine their perks to find out exactly what moment on your journey together led them to choose that perk and how those abilities will manifest themselves in combat. Each companion has a total of six possible perks, although they can only learn three through your interactions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, your companion could end up with a completely different set of perks compared to another companion brought in by a fellow clan member. In Conan Exiles Age of Heroes, you can have multiple companions of the same character with different sets of perks. It's up to you to complete the quests for each additional companion you wish to recruit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Conan Exiles – Age of Heroes Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTI5N7tBlvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another big new feature of the update is the so-called living player settlement system. Whereas NPC workers in a Conan Exiles player's base used to be entirely static, they will now be powered by an internal needs system to imitate dynamic behavior. Needs include hunger, rest, sleep, and work.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the base is attacked, the workers will trigger a flee-or-fight behavior. As a general rule, this should be tied to their job (e.g., a cook would probably flee), but Funcom hinted that there may be exceptions. Furthermore, with the new update, the workers won't be attached to a specific workstation anymore; their bonuses will instead apply to all stations relevant to their profession and tier within a 140m radius (about 54 foundation blocks).</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Last but not least, after many requests from Conan Exiles players, the workers can now be dressed up like any fighter, so you can change their clothing and weapons according to your liking.</p>
<p>The Bazaar item shop also got a significant expansion to the Argossean building set: there's the beautifully detailed observatory, interior decorations, and Pictish weapons and armors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/killing-time-resurrected-review-mansion-madness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios">Nightdive Studios</a> announces a new remaster for an old title, I get excited. It gives me -- and others -- a chance to check out antiquated or otherwise forgotten games that have slipped through the cracks of time. Such is the case with <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>, a shockingly refreshing and charismatic old-school shooter that originally launched on the 3DO, of all things.</p>
<p>Not all 3DO games are built the same, that much is certain after playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed"><em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em></a> earlier this year. Trade <em>Po'ed</em>'s abstract and haphazard level design for the more deliberate open world of&nbsp; <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>, and you'll fall in love with both the Prohibition-era setting as well as its surprisingly engaging story, all told through real-life actors via full-motion video (FMV).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-fmv.jpg?itok=yFenz2O1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-fmv.jpg?itok=5AQpe_SJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These scenes are visually enhanced, having more visual clarity than old versions of <em>Killing Time: Resurrected.</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>'s Novel Way of Storytelling</h2>
<p><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> captivated me right from the start. This title was originally released in 1995, and shooters from that era are plentiful, though they tend to gravitate toward fantasy or science fiction. In this stylish, art deco-inspired shooter set around the 1930s, an engrossing narrative unravels as players explore an estate and its surrounding grounds on an enigmatic isle.</p>
<p>We're quickly introduced to several characters through the use of FMV cutscenes. Walking up to certain points around the island play these scenes, and this is one aspect where <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> really sets itself apart from other shooters of the era. FMV was definitely more common in the 90s than now, but to use it aplenty in a shooter seems novel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-fmv-2.jpg?itok=MAUHxHhm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-fmv-2.jpg?itok=GLsnXcd1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This butler guy? He's chill.</figcaption></figure><p>A deep story isn't exactly a mainstay of the genre, with few exceptions. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is one of those exceptions -- through its use of FMV, I was easily engaged with the story, and became very interested to see what twists and turns it had in store.</p>
<p>The owner of this island, Tess Conway, becomes increasingly intrigued by the occult, and she comes in possession of an Egyptian water clock. Through various machinations that you'll see unravel through FMV -- which are essentially glimpses into the past -- she ends up trapping the entire island in time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-environments.jpg?itok=1IGJizb5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-environments.jpg?itok=BeU94OYy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just doing some pest extermination.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>'s Manor is Entrancing</h2>
<p>That's the bare minimum of the story, but there are dozens of different scenes, and six or so characters that all interact with each other in one way or another. The acting is hit or miss, but the writing for the actual dialogue is quite good.</p>
<p>All of this takes place across the aforementioned isle. This is another aspect where <em>Killing Time: Resurrected </em>shines. Rather than being split into levels or episodes like your typical boomer shooter, the isle is one vast, explorable space full of enemies.</p>
<p>The mansion itself, right in the middle of this isle, is the star of the show. Outside it's almost like a castle, and inside it's a surprisingly massive complex with rooms aplenty. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> feels like a super solid corridor shooter while inside the mansion. Each wing of this manse has its own theme and character to it, adding even more mystery and whimsy to the abode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-enemies.jpg?itok=LaVCIM-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-enemies.jpg?itok=TMWcnmbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Housekeeping does not take kindly to shotguns.</figcaption></figure><p>The prevailing theme here is art deco -- which looks absolutely stunning with Nightdive's enhanced visuals -- and you'll fight a myriad of strange enemies within. The East Wing is meant for entertainment, with a beautiful ballroom, dining area, and tons of space for partying. Fittingly so, it's also filled with killer clowns, as well as gangsters, undead chefs, and more.</p>
<p>The West Wing is for guests, and again this is bedazzled with beautiful, opulent flair. Portly housekeepers and demonic maids stand in our way, and upstairs even more madness ensues with the complex layout of this mansion. It's extraordinarily fun to explore, and plenty of surprises await players within.</p>
<p>There are various Egyptian-themed temples and other buildings scattered across the island as well; here, you need to grab keys and other items in order to progress. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is a blast when you know where you're going, but it's also a great big key and item hunt at the end of the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-temple.jpg?itok=Vw6HiKFy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-temple.jpg?itok=m-lp4LqT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is not something you'd expect to see on a seemingly innocuous island.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fetch Me the Keys!</h2>
<p>When you don't know where to go, well, <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> can feel monotonous. Enemies you kill stay dead, so there's nothing to entertain you while you retread your path looking for keys. What's more, these keys are color-based, and there are ten in total. As someone who is colorblind, it was difficult to tell which key went where, and as far as I know, there's no remedy to make this aspect more legible.</p>
<p>The wide open, outside areas of the grounds are also not nearly as exciting as the mansion itself, because you're mostly fighting the same handful of enemies in the woods. Though it should not be understated, this game came out in 1995 originally -- it was an ambitious concept to begin with, but it still ages well enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-map.jpg?itok=qGNT6-w6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-map.jpg?itok=BjwYxDhu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can see, the map is surprisingly vast.</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect that <em>didn't</em> age quite so gracefully is <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>'s weapons. Gunplay is serviceable, perhaps adequate, but gun variety is subpar. There are six weapons total, disregarding melee. The pistol becomes obsolete almost immediately as it shares ammo with the Thompson, and that does everything the pistol does, but better.</p>
<p>There's a shotgun, which will likely be your mainstay, a flamethrower (its ammo can be sparse), molotov cocktails, which are highly situational, and an ankh, essentially this game's BFG. You're mostly alternating between the shotgun and Thompson the entire time, so the variety leaves a lot to be desired. Even one or two more guns would have made gunplay more appealing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-time-environments-2.jpg?itok=FRLgFoG8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-time-environments-2.jpg?itok=CMXVVyld 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No shooting in the library!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Nightdive's work on this port is basically flawless. Compare images from the original game with this remaster, and you'll be amazed by the work they do. Visuals are crisp, and gameplay is smooth as smooth can be. At this point, I would be surprised if Nightdive botched a remaster, because each one I've played thus far has been just as good, if not better, than the last<em>: Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is no different in that regard.</p>
<p>What a pleasant surprise, <em>Killing Time: Resurrected </em>is. This once obscure shooter gains new life with a wonderful remaster. Indeed, it's become one of my favorite shooters of the era, and that's accredited to its unique identity and unconventional approach to storytelling. They really just don't make 'em like they used to, and <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is proof of that.</p>

<p>The Olympic Update is pretty aptly-named; it brings a new region with a brand new Guardian to vanquish, as well as Xinth, the Black Coat, a brand new weapon with unique Aspects for you to discover.</p>
<p>You can now decorate the Crossroads with "dozens of unlockable decorations" and spruce it up with music tracks, too, bringing "a personal touch to your home between the realms", as Supergiant says.</p>

<p>If you're running a Mac, you'll also be pleased to learn that this update brings native Mac M1 support, although you're out of luck if your Mac has a chip that's older than the M1, sadly.</p>
<p>In terms of what lies in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s future, Supergiant says it wants to work on "what awaits further beyond the newly-added Region" for the next major update, alongside new Boons and new enemies.</p>
<p>The studio is estimating that this update will be launched sometime early next year, and it should take "a little less development time overall" than the Olympic Update did.</p>

<p>The full&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>Olympic Update patch notes are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available to read here</a> if you want to know everything that's new.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in true Supergiant style, you can enjoy the patch notes in the form of a dramatic reading given by narrator Logan Cunningham, because of course you can.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents the next generation of this twenty-year-old shooter series. It’s one of the most highly-anticipated titles to hit the franchise in years, and Activision (and associated studios) spared no expense when marketing and promoting the game. However, there’s one question that still floats around the minds of COD multiplayer fans worldwide: Does Black Ops 6 have SBMM?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-sbmm-in-cod">What is SBMM in COD?</h2>



<p>SBMM means ‘Skill-Based Matchmaking’, and it’s an algorithm-driven mechanic that determines who you’re matched with online. It’s driven by many criteria, such as your ping, input, kill-death ratio, and match history, but it’s one of the most controversial features in Call of Duty’s storied history.</p>



<p>Many multiplayer gamers <strong>hate</strong> SBMM because it ‘deliberately’ forces you to play against more challenging opponents more regularly, rather than landing you in a truly randomised pool of players for each new game. That means that the better you are, the tougher your experience will be.</p>



<p>In recent years, Activision has tweaked SBMM to be even more intelligent. It can now tell when you’re ‘about to’ quit Call of Duty, and by way of a response, it might offer you a slightly more relaxed lobby so that you do better and keep playing for longer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sbmm-in-black-ops-6">Is SBMM in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately for some, Black Ops 6 <strong>does </strong>have SBMM. It has been claimed that every Call of Duty game for the last ten years or more has featured SBMM elements, and Black Ops 6 will be no different. Further, it’s assumed that Black Ops 6 will feature more intelligent SBMM than ever before, as it’s a mechanic that Activision’s teams are forever trying to improve.</p>



<p>SBMM isn’t always a bad thing, of course. In 2024, Activision lifted the lid on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveals-sbmm-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">driving factors of Skill-Based Matchmaking</a>. It was explained that the more important factors when matching players with one another are elements like connection, ‘time-to-match’, platform, and whether or not the users have access to voice chat.</p>



<p>The most critical factor is ping – <strong>not </strong>K/D or recent match performance.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s not necessarily a bad thing that Black Ops 6 does have SBMM – it might be a mess of unstable matches and connection errors, otherwise.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2’s patch 4.0 is a free content update and is now live. It introduces a new Operation called Termination, a new photo mode for Operations, balancing changes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The free update adds Termination as a new PvE Operation for Space Marine 2. The Operation will occur on the planet of Kadaku, where players will find new “dreadful foes”. You will have to use your artillery to eliminate these pesky enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Space Marine 2’s update also adds new Lethal difficulty for Operations; check them out below.</p>



<ul>
<li>Ammo Crates will have limited refills per player.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Majoris Enemies can become more deadly and harder to kill if they get enraged.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Armour will be restored through finishers only when you are around your battle brothers.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Overcoming these challenges will reward players with new cosmetics.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Space Marine 2’s update will also add a Photo Mode in operations. However, players will only be able to use it when playing solo. Moreover, the characters you are trying to capture will now follow the camera with their eyes. If you are interested in the gameplay and balancing tweaks, check out the <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/97-patch-notes-4-0-new-content-for-operations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> for Space Marine 2’s patch 4.0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Focus Entertainment recently announced that Space Marine 2 has 4.5 million players across all platforms. The game is also the most-played title from the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, with an all-time peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2183900/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">225,690 on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Nintendo shutting down emulators like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a> years after their first release may have to do with the Nintendo Switch 2, as the system may end up being easier to emulate near launch than the vast majority of gaming consoles.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-mmo/">Game Freak leak</a>, which confirmed the Ounce codename for the next Nintendo console, among other things, as reported by<a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Centro LEAKS</a>, the system seems to use the same tools and ROM format that is being used for the current Switch, but with new encryption keys only known to Nintendo. This would make the system far easier to emulate than every other gaming system at launch and may explain why the Japanese company shut down emulators like Ryujinx and Yuzu after they had been widely available for years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ounce (Switch 2) seems to use the same tools and ROM format Nintendo currently uses for Switch 1 (ROMs are still NSPs), but obviously they have new encryption keys that only Nintendo has</p>

<p>Very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 other than that it has been in the works for a while. Production seems to have started ramping up recently, and a first look at what is supposed to be an early prototype was shared online <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/">last month</a>. Unfortunately, it's still not clear when the system will be formally announced and when precisely it will be released, although recent reports suggest that the console could be ready for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumored-to-be-ready-for-march-april-2025-launch/">March-April 2025 release.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

				<div>
					
					
								<p><em>World of Warcraft</em>, or <em>WoW</em>, is like the Red Hot Chili Peppers of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying genre: not only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_2022%E2%80%932024_Global_Stadium_Tour">is it still going strong</a> but it’s also somehow even bigger than you thought. <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s current numbers aren’t public, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHDFgZAuJHU">one recent educated guess</a> came in at 7 million paying subscribers, which, at $15 / month, would make the game a billion-dollar earner by itself. Its developer, Blizzard, merged with Activision in 2008, and Microsoft gobbled up both companies in 2022, but <em>World of Warcraft </em>remains a load-bearing spine of the newly formed corporate turducken. The game that redefined gold mining for the 21st century is still a 19th-century gold mine for its landlords.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>It’s also thriving in a subscription ecosystem that it helped to legitimize. <em>World of Warcraft</em> debuted in 2004, during an era when you still had to buy games in boxes from stores. The runaway success of Blizzard’s always-on portal to Azeroth proved that, for the right product, studios could charge a recurring fee beyond the initial cost of the core game’s (at the time) formidable five installation CDs. Here, in the enshittified 2020s, we’ve all grown used to renting our culture by the month, but it was genuinely pathbreaking for <em>World of Warcraft</em> to have 12 million subscribers at its peak in 2010. It didn’t invent the monthly model, which had already gained traction in games like <em>Ultima Online</em> and <em>EverQuest</em> during the dawn of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) genre. But <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s success took that recurring charge mainstream and helped popularize the unassailable business logic that having your customers pay you once was worse than having them pay you until they decided or remembered to stop.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>As <em>World of Warcraft </em>turns 20,<em> </em>its enduring financial success arguably pales in comparison to its cultural significance. I asked Angela Washko, a new-media artist who staged several notable performance pieces inside the game world, what she considered <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s biggest contribution, for better or worse. “<em>World of Warcraft</em> expanded the notion of what public space was,” she told me. “I saw the bonds created amongst members of my guilds moving beyond the game space, as players flew across the country to meet each other.” Everyone I talked to about <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s legacy seemed to mention someone or other getting married, either in the game itself or here in reality after meeting in the game. “I think the degree of immersion and dissolving of the boundary between ‘real life’ and ‘fantasy’ within <em>World of Warcraft</em> was really a turning point in computing culture,” Washko said, adding that <em>World of Warcraft </em>“changed the conversation around video games from being something that was ‘an escape from everyday life’ to something that was an extension of one’s social life and happened to take place in a virtual environment.”&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Through her own work, Washko also explored the less savory side of a fantasy game populated by real people; her <a href="https://angelawashko.com/section/300206-The%20Council%20on%20Gender%20Sensitivity%20and%20Behavioral%20Awareness%20in%20World%20of%20Warcraft.html">Council on Gender Sensitivity and Behavioral Awareness in <em>World of Warcraft</em></a> involved traveling from town to town to educate passersby about feminism and discuss how the game’s dominant culture often created a hostile environment for its marginalized players. I recalled my own playing days, when you could be flying into a town on your hippogryph, minding your own business, only to be deluged by a wave of sewer-grade hate speech on a public text channel. We now take it for granted that online spaces reflect the social dynamics of the people who occupy them, including and especially the problematic ones, but in many ways, <em>World of Warcraft</em> was the kobold in this particular coal mine.</p>

				</div>
		
				<div>
					
					
								<p>I first encountered the <em>Warcraft</em> universe like many ’90s computer kids: as a series of top-down, real-time strategy games about economic management and cartoon fantasy violence. The world (lowercase) of <em>Warcraft</em> pitted the seemingly noble Alliance (humans, elves, dwarves, your Tolkienesque usual suspects) against the villainized Horde (orcs, trolls, and other stock monster-humanoids from the trope factory) in a vicious-with-a-touch-of-slapstick conflict spanning three main titles and numerous expansions between 1994 and 2003. If no one was using the phone, you could play against your friends over a modem. The series had a rich and goofy aesthetic of exaggerated proportions, saturated colors, and sarcastic jokes. The units that ran your economy were literal simpering peons, which gave everything a barrel-shaped, vaguely comedic flavor that played well against the high-gloss cinematic interludes that would become Blizzard’s calling card.</p>

								<p>Flush with revenues from its flagship series, Blizzard began exploring how it might expand <em>Warcraft</em>’s popular lore into other types of games. First, a point-and-click game called <em>Warcraft Adventures</em> — a late-1990s attempt at LucasArts-style vintage puzzle-solving in a cel-shaded take on the<em> </em>mythos — was infamously canceled for not meeting Blizzard’s internal release standards. (It also leaked, fully playable, not too long ago. Based on what I’ve seen, Blizzard was right.) Then, starting in 2001, an experimental team of a few dozen people got busy building a whole new engine that would bring Azeroth into 3D for the first time and let players meet, socialize, and slaughter skeletons together. It was a primordial example of the modern phenomenon where a corporation exploits its intellectual property by jumping genres and colonizing a new medium. It was also how they’d get me.</p>

								<p>There are plenty of humbling ways to use Gmail’s internal search function, especially if you’ve had your account for roughly as long as <em>World of Warcraft </em>has existed. For one example, consider my collected personal correspondence surrounding <em>World of Warcraft</em>, from the peak years of its involvement in my life. When I queried “Warcraft before:2007/1/1,” it yielded about two dozen results, and together, they trace a blunt biography of that moment: landing a big new job; getting hella dumped; and “spending two months as an antisocial hermit,” as I told a friend in a Gchat in early 2006. (And how about <em>World of Warcraft </em>outliving Gchat?)&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Reviewing the private record, it’s clear <em>World of Warcraft </em>tore through my life like an experienced raiding party of max-level grinders through the Deadmines. Admittedly, it was the kind of nymph-stage young adult life that was conceptually made of crepe paper and easily shredded by a video game. But something about the predictable rhythm of ordering junk food delivery after an exhausting workday, logging onto <em>World of Warcraft,</em> and hopping through some lush environment searching for herbs to make into sellable virtual potions just drew me in, one night after another.</p>

								<p>This aspect of <em>World of Warcraft</em> — its knack for blurring the line between work and fun until the casual observer might not quite recognize it as either — often came up when I spoke to others about their experiences. “One thing <em>WoW</em> proved on a large scale is that people will turn a game into a job at the slightest provocation,” said Cory O’Brien, now a narrative and level designer for games like <em>Redfall </em>and <em>HoloVista</em>. <em>“</em>I remember spending hours and hours and hours grinding for dust so that I could enchant magic items. I remember smelting tin and copper to make bronze.” The elaborate crafting system in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, which often required materials gained through repetitive in-game labor, represented an explosion in the popularity of the now-ubiquitous mechanic where you, as a player, find some stuff and turn it into something else. “I still play all these more recent games like <em>Minecraft,</em> <em>Project Zomboid,</em> and <em>Valheim</em> that are literally just that crafting part,” O’Brien told me. “I spend so much time doing monotonous, repetitive tasks, for free, because somehow we have discovered that that’s fun.” Here, in 2024, it’s hard not to feel a vaguely sinister undertone to all of this as the rising tides of capitalistic overreach gamify the gig economy and hijack the natural human affinity for rewards for their own extractive purposes. But to Washko’s point about an expanded social life, one reason this all worked is that you were often helping out real people, with “legitimate needs” in the scope of the game. You were rarely just doing these things for yourself.</p>

								<p>It wasn’t always exactly a waste, either. Andrew Simone, now a project manager in tech, attributes a large swath of his professional tool kit to skills he gained as a guild leader in <em>World of Warcraft. </em>“I actually stopped playing <em>WoW</em> largely because I felt like I was managing my guild more than my actual professional jobs,” he told me, proceeding to outline a frightening slate of workplace-flavored tasks that included interviewing prospective guild candidates, analyzing performance metrics from the game’s multiuser boss fights, dealing with in-guild sexual harassment, managing schedules across the world to hold meetings about all these things, writing guides for new members, and even “cultivating a kind of guild culture so people <em>enjoyed</em> being there,” which is an incredible thing to say about something that is already ostensibly a game. I know there are countless former guild leaders reading this and nodding along because their current workday docket has nothing on mediating a 10-way raiding party dispute over who should get the legendary enchanted pauldrons that just dropped.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>On the other hand: plenty of it <em>was</em> a giant waste. I can’t tell you, back in the day, how many hours I was technically playing <em>World of Warcraft </em>but<em> </em>ignoring the game itself while I sifted through, rearranged, and tested various custom add-ons for its labyrinthine, fintech-ass user interface. <em>World of Warcraft </em>is a persistent software ecosystem with clients and servers and all kinds of data flying between them at all times — it’s just not necessarily exposed to every player in full. An entire cottage industry of user-created UI mods sprung up to assign repeatable actions to shortcut keys, or process advanced analytics from game logs like Simone would do for his guild, or implement an “<a href="https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23151-AGT-AutomaticGoblinTherapist.html">automatic goblin therapist</a>” who answers any incoming whispers to your character with an in-game implementation of the classic ELIZA protocol. Letting players scratch their own itches for how the game felt to play was also a clever way to limit complaints about the parts of it that weren’t as polished. I never got much into the game’s advanced content myself, but for those who did, pretty much the only way to follow the expected meta of guild raids was to use externally designed UI add-ons. <em>World of Warcraft </em>had the audacity to make players create their own custom cockpits for the game and ended up creating a kind of recursive procrastination where you could even distract yourself from your intended leisure activity. Anyone who’s ever rearranged the app icons on their phone knows just how ubiquitous this kind of time-consuming “metawork” has become.</p>

								<p>Recently, I engaged in a more contemporary form of networked social entertainment — sitting around a big TV with friends, watching four strangers play a game together on Twitch. Just as things were picking up, the stream cut out, and an algorithmically inserted video ad began to play: it was for <em>World of Warcraft</em>. This was a group of mostly game designers, and before I had a chance to say anything, someone <em>else</em> piped in to mention <em>World of Warcraft</em> was 20 years old now — and formally impactful enough that working game makers still know its birthday.</p>

								<p>Seeing that ad, writing this piece, none of it was enough to get me to reinstall <em>World of Warcraft</em>. (It’s a good thing the game never stooped to making you feed your in-game pets.) I didn’t really feel I had to replay the game to measure its influence because its influence is everywhere. Every monthly subscription, in-game economy, or digital “third place” where lives bleed into online connections owes it some spiritual recognition as prior art; those things have all become inescapable. Twenty years later, we are all living in the <em>World of Warcraft.</em></p>

<p>"At this time, the title will not be available for release in the region. As a result, all pre-orders in Kuwait will be cancelled and refunded to the original point of purchase," Activision told us. "We remain hopeful that local authorities will reconsider, and allow players in Kuwait to enjoy this all-new experience in the Black Ops series."</p><p>While Activision did not go into further detail as to why Black Ops 6 had not been approved for sale in Kuwait, it is fair to assume the game's Gulf War themes are a key factor for this decision. Iraq invaded Kuwait in the early 90s, which triggered the start of the first Gulf War.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release later this month, on 25th October.

            <p>Analogue has unveiled its next console, the Analogue 3D, that allows users to play original N64 cartridges in 4K.</p>
<p>The console follows Analogue's successful Analogue Pocket device that plays original Game Boy cartridges.</p>
<p>"Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation: it's not only the world's first reimagining of an N64 - but the world's first 100 percent-compatible recreation of an N64," reads the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3D">company's website</a>.</p>

<p>"No more incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more. For the first time, you can re-experience the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise."</p>
<p>In addition, the console is region free, includes both bluetooth and wi-fi, and features four original-style controller ports.</p>
<p>Further, Analogue has created a new wireless controller with 8BitDo, though its modern design loses the iconic three prongs of Nintendo's original. It's sold separately for $39.99.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Introducing Analogue 3D. A reimagining of the N64. </p><p>In 4K resolution. Perhaps the greatest multiplayer system of all time.

<p>The console itself comes in black or white and is available for $249.99 (about £192). Pre-orders will open on 21st October directly from the <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">Analogue store</a>, with shipping expected in the first quarter of 2025 (according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year">ArsTechnica</a>).</p>
<p>On the product website, Analogue details the "unmistakable essence" of CRT to the look and feel of N64 games. As such, the console features original display modes to meticulously reproduce CRT displays. "Capturing the warmth, depth, and texture in every frame. The soft glow of phosphor and vibrant colours unite with immersive scanlines and shadow masks. This isn't just upscaling - it's an unprecedented transformation."</p><p>It certainly looks like a beautiful machine - especially if the Analogue Pocket is anything to go by. Of course, if you own a Nintendo Switch, you can play plenty of N64 games if you have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">Switch Online Expansion Pack</a> membership.</p>
<p>Still, the Analogue 3D uses original cartridges, meaning the whole catalogue of games will be playable beyond the obvious Mario and Zelda favourites.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This year's Fallout Day will be celebrated in style, with a broadcast that will give players a glimpse at the future of Fallout 76, the latest entry in the series.</p>
<p>As confirmed by Bethesda, Jon Rush and Bill Lacoste, Creative Director and Lead Producer of the latest entry in the series, will provide a new look at what the team is working on during the first-ever Fallout Day broadcast, which will air on October 23rd at 9:00 PM CEST/ 3:00 PM EST / 12:00 PM PST. FalloutforHope, a community-run charity initiative, will also be part of the festivities, as confirmed by a video message shared on the official X profile.</p>

<p>While only Fallout 76 has been mentioned to be part of the broadcast, it would definitely make sense for Bethesda to take advantage of the occasion to speak more about what's in store for the future of the popular series, especially now that its popularity is at an all-time high thanks to the successful TV show by Amazon which has registered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-tv-show-has-registered-100-million-viewers-to-date/">100 million viewers</a> to date. Even without Bethesda's involvement, however, fans of the series are still able to experience more Fallout in existing games thanks to high-quality fan-made mods, such as the incredible <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London mod</a>, which finally brings the post-apocalyptic series outside the United States for the first time.</p>

The concert included songs from its Arma series, as well as DayZ, Ylands, and Vigor.</p><p>But the big surprise of the night was a blink and you’ll miss it announcement that <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/arma-iv">Arma 4</a> is due out in 2027. At the end of the final piece of the night, the game’s logo and release window flashed on the big screen that was propped up behind the orchestra for little more than a second, but it was long enough to catch the attention of the live audience as well as the livestream chat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/screenshot-2024-10-17-093220-1729154703401.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Arma is Bohemia’s hugely successful PC military shooter that first launched back in 2006. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/arma-3">Arma 3</a> launched in 2013, with the latest release, the standalone <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/arma-reforger">Arma Reforger</a>, launching in 2022 in early access form before a 1.0 launch last year.</p><p>Reforger was designed as a “bridge” to Arma 4, which is intended for PC and consoles. Reforger was the first game in the Arma series to launch on console (Xbox Series X and S), and has helped Bohemia learn how best to take the PC-focused series multiplatform in a big way with Arma 4.</p><p>2027 is of course three years away, and it’s fair to say Arma fans had hoped to see Arma 4 come out before then. Already the memes about GTA 6 coming out before Arma 4 are flooding in, and we haven’t even suggested Arma 4 might be delayed. The question is, which consoles will Arma 4 launch on when it comes out in 2027?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>At the time of this article’s publication, Bohemia had yet to make an official announcement about Arma 4 coming in 2027, release any notes to press or screenshots or trailers. Using a live concert for such a significant announcement is certainly novel, but hopefully the developer will follow it up with something more tangible sooner rather than later.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>As shared by publisher Konami, the remake, which puts players back into the grief-riddled shoes of James Sunderland, has already sold a total of 1m copies (that's across both physical and digital media) since its global launch on 8th October.</p>
<p>In fact, Konami said the remake reached this sales milestone in less than a week, citing sales figures from 11th October. So, that's actually a whopping 1m copies in just three days.</p>

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's review for Silent Hill 2 remake in video form. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOv1JTfPnuQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by industry insider DuskGolem, this rather zippy timeframe makes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> the fastest-selling entry in the series to date.</p>
<p>What's more, while Bloober hasn't published sales of its previous games, this so far appears to be the company's biggest critical and commercial success to date.</p>
<p>As a slight aside (considering the two series were traditionally in competition on PlayStation), <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1846479698232324198">Capcom</a> also announced today its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake has now welcomed "eight million-plus agents" since its debut.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Silent Hill 2 Remake has surpassed 1 million units sold in less than a week (via Konami's press release, reached 1 million sales on October 11th).</p><p>Makes it the fastest selling Silent Hill game by far, &amp; certainly not bad for a PS5/PC exclusive releasing for a long dormant IP. <a href="https://t.co/OqpYs5kbI5">https://t.co/OqpYs5kbI5</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1846770601027162471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>But, back to Silent Hill 2. It is fair to say today's sales milestone is well deserved for Bloober. The game has been met with widespread acclaim from critics and fans, who have praised the developer for its brillaint remake. </p><p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," our Vikki wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Praise the gods, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> update day, and developers Supergiant are not mucking about. They have bolstered the nippy roguelike with a heap of shiny new things in this "Olympian Update", including a new weapon with homing attacks, a liver-pecking boss fight, two new animal familiars, and the home region of the Gods - mount Olympus. It's probably the biggest update they've made yet in terms of fresh sights. And by "fresh sights", I mean Dionysus sporting a leopard-print thong. Yikes.</p>

<p>Chief among the changes is the new region, Olympus, which looks suitably full of marble statues and ionic columns, if suspiciously gloomy. The new weapon is called the Black Coat, which can launch a bunch of missile-like orbs at enemies or be used to perform damage-blocking counterattacks. Your two new animal familiars will be Raki the raven and Hecuba the hound, who can dig holes for you in place of the usual shovel, it seems. Yes, you can pet the dog. Don't make Frinos the frog jealous, now.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how much this update advances the story, we're told that there are now 2500 new voice lines,  plus "expanded subplots" for certain characters like Arachne the spider gal and Dora the friendly ghost. But the big new development in this regard is probably the appearance of Prometheus, the Titan that made humans from clay and then stole fire from the gods to give to humanity. You'll be fighting him as a boss, and likely learning a bit about his motivations. The eagle who chows on his liver every day also seeks extra protein from your face.</p><p>Like I say, it's an absolutely stacked update. You'll be able to decorate your hub at the Crossroads. Many hexes and keepsakes have been tweaked. There's new portrait art for Charon, Medea, and Hades, among others. And while Olympus is the big new hot spot, existing regions also have some new locales, we're told. I'm not even going to try to summarise the many, many changes to boons and blessings. Just know that there are some new boons, while others have been altered, and a few have been removed. </p>
<p>All the highlights are mentioned in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870232159705">this Steam post</a> but you can get into the nitty gritty of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716">the full patch notes</a> if you like. Supergiant has even recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtih_yy6IA">a 26-minute long "dramatic reading"</a> of the changes, featuring Logan Cunningham, voice actor of Homer and vocal calling card of the studio. This sounds like the most niche bedtime listening.</p>
<p>I found the fast pace and quippy conversatin' of Hades 2 a lot of fun in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access review</a>. But I haven't been back to it much. Maybe this update will convince me to go check on my favourite rival, Nemesis. According to these patch notes, "she is less quick about gruffly running through exits; she is less quick to purchase items from Charon." Aw, I always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-best-girl-is-nemesis-because-she-messes-up-your-run">liked that about her</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden has discussed the state of the games industry, stating there's a "collapse of creativity" and that relying on blockbusters is "a death sentence".</p>
<p>Layden took to the stage at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Asia alongside Raw Fury co-founder and chief publishing officer Gordon Van Dyke (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward">GI.Biz</a>), where the pair discussed the disappearance of AA studios.</p>
<p>In the past, said Layden, studios focused simply on whether a game was fun rather than monetisation schemes, though admitted "risk tolerance was fairly high".</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Today, the entry costs for making a AAA game is in triple digit millions now," he continued. "I think naturally, risk tolerance drops. And you're [looking] at sequels, you're looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, 'Well, if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.' We're seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production."</p>
<p>Further, Layden stated "AA is gone", which he described as "a threat to the ecosystem".</p>
<p>Noting the general standard of games, including indie titles, is much higher thanks to advancements in tools, he continued: "Now if we can just get a bit more interest and excitement and exposure for these lower budget, but super creative and super unusual [type] of games... I'd like to see more of that. Because if we're just going to rely on the blockbusters to get us through, I think that's a death sentence."</p>
<p>AA games can bring "the new thing" and can be developed far quicker than AAA games, said Layden. Most importantly, though, they must seek unique ideas not monetisation.</p>
<p>"If you're going to pitch me your AA game, and in the first two pages of your deck is your monetisation and revenue, subscription scheme, I'm out. Your first page has to be 'This game needs to be made and here's why'," he said.</p>
<p>"I want to see that fire, I don't want to see 'here's the chief accountant on the team that's going to explain to you the [game's monetisation]'."</p>
<p>Layden also commented on current trends around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI in game development</a>, stating it's "not a saviour".</p>
<p>"Artificial intelligence has been in gaming since almost the first or second games ever made," he said. "So all this excitement about gen AI, I find kind of humorous. I do see its applications in certain places for certain things. But it's just a tool, it's not a saviour. It's a tool in the way that Excel is a tool. It just helps speed you along your tasks."</p>
<p>Layden began working for Sony in 1987, eventually serving as chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2014 - 2019. He's worked as a strategic advisor at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> since September 2022.</p>
<p>His comments are perhaps best reflected in games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, a unique and creative concept that was certainly a risk for Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>That studio was closed by Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">subsequently acquired by Krafton</a>. And Krafton boss Changhan 'CH' Kim has made comments that parallel those of Layden - specifically the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">studio acquisition was motivated by the desire to maintain its legacy rather than make money</a>.</p>
<p>"We wanted to maintain their legacy," said Kim. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organisation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Leadership at Don’t Nod yesterday “presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies,” via <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278">financials report</a>, in response to "a balance sheet that highlights the need to secure the company's resources" following the underperformance of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden</a>.</p>
<p>In plain terms, this means that up to 69 workers at the French company are at risk of layoffs due to an 11% year-on-year decline in operating revenue, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-nod-announces-layoffs-that-could-impact-up-to-69-workers">via IGN</a>. The number represents "29% of the Paris studio workforce", say the STJV.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take," said Don’t Nod’s CEO and Chairman Oskar Guilbert. "The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness.</p>
<p>"As a result," the statement continued, "today we presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies, which could set DON'T NOD on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p>
<p>In late September, Don’t Nod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-nod-pause-two-game-projects-and-refocus-others-following-jusant-and-banishers-sales-disappointment">announced that they’d paused development</a> on two upcoming projects, and that development on others had been "refocused to reach a wider audience", again citing the underperformance of Jusant and Banishers.</p>
<p>Back in early September, French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) put out a press release titled <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/">"DON’T NOD: Ascension or free fall?"</a>. "We’re sounding the alarm on the situation of Don’t Nod employees," they wrote, alleging "erratic" and "tumultuous" project management and citing concern over "the psychosocial hazards Don’t Nod’s workers are facing, in view of the significant number of reports of ill-being and sick leaves." The press release also describes a situation in which "Jusant’s developers were left in the dark about their future, many without any work to do, for over 2 months" following that game’s release.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Don’t Nod’s financial report yesterday, the STJV put out <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/at-dont-nod-the-only-plans-for-the-future-are-layoffs/">another statement </a>entitled "At Don’t Nod, the only plans for the future are layoffs", calling the layoff plans "the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions".</p>
<p>"Today’s meeting, after 2 weeks of waiting in anguish, was revealed as the starting point of a layoff plan," write the STJV. "Workers’ representatives were not told in advance about the meeting’s topic, and were not provided with any documents and information before the it, which goes against the law."</p><p>"The Don’t Nod union section, as well the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers," they continue. "We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too aggressive to speak with. With this layoffs plan, they are creating an atmosphere of extreme violece [sic]. We are calling on all workers at Don’t Nod to mobilise to save their jobs and working conditions".</p>
<p>Alice Bell (RPS in peace) awarded both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jusant-review">Jusant</a> a Bestest Best, and Jusant was a personal favourite of mine from last year. Best of luck to the workers who helped make such wonderful games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I punched a cultist in the face in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue-2">Streets Of Rogue 2</a>, just because. He started running away - something I would not allow. When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.</p>
<p>Streets Of Rogue 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/">has a demo</a> out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.</p>

<p>If you missed the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue">Streets Of Rogue</a>, it was a small but mighty indie immersive sim of sorts, with random roguelike elements thrown in to create a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-review">funny, chaotic sandbox of silliness</a>. You're supposed to be climbing floor after floor in an effort to find and dethrone the city mayor. But more often you end up freeing a troop of gorillas and watching as they run amok, or hacking all the ATMs while a co-op friend injects themselves with a syringe of gigantism. </p><p>The sequel is following suit, with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-2-goes-open-world-and-you-can-drive-a-truck-through-a-barn">load of extra stuff thrown in</a>. Even something as simple as gathering chicken to craft a sandwich can take a comic turn for the worse. At first, I figured I'd simply buy some chicken fillets in the shop. But the only store in town was closed. What does that matter? I smashed the window and cut myself on broken glass clambering inside, only to find neither chicken in the freezer nor money in the cash register. </p>
<p>I washed my face in the staff bathroom, again because I can. This normally removes status effects. But my status was merely chickenless. I had to leave town and source my meat from the wilderness on the outskirts, where a gang of live chickens were frolicking happily in a pond. "I'll just kill a hen and watch the others run away in terror," I thought, getting out my trusty chef's pocket knife. But as soon as I stuck one chicken, four others immediately turned on me, pecking my poor body to pieces. </p>
<p>I barely managed to fend them off. And I had to go back to the shop to buy bread from the shopkeeper anyway, who had finally opened for business. I eyed the broken glass innocently. Shopkeepers in Streets Of Rogue 2 carry shotguns, just like the cranky hawkers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky-2">Spelunky 2</a>. </p>
<p>There's a lot missing, this being a demo. But it does grant you a sneak peek at the possibilities. I created a vanilla world during the world generation process. But an encouraging amount of world modifiers are teased in the menu. You'll be able to make every animal invincible, it seems, or adjust a "cop leniency" meter. One modifier turns the game into "Water World", another reads "Zombies Ate My Game Balance", which suggests a means of transforming the game into a zombie apocalypse playground. </p><p>As for personal stats and quirks, these can include being computer illiterate, or being addicted to all drugs. You may need to kill at least once per day, or be unable to speak to people at all. One quirk makes you small enough to flush yourself down a toilet, like the shapeshifter of the previous game. Probably handy in a bind.</p>
<p>As part of the tutorial, I was sent to kill the mayor in a larger neighbouring town, which I did. But only after driving a car at questionable speeds and hitting many pedestrians along the way. The cars (a new addition) handle very nicely, drifting and sliding along with the smooth sensation of an old-school Grand Theft Auto. I parked neatly in the carpark of city hall, denting perhaps only five other vehicles, and got to work sneaking around inside the building, knife at the ready. I was discovered by goons and office workers multiple times. It was perhaps inadvisable to plant so many landmines in the hallways. Many people died. </p>

<p>Including the mayor himself. You're meant to be able to wear the mayor's hat after killing him, and give a speech at the podium to inherit his municipal throne. But at this point the tutorial bugged out and wouldn't detect that I wore the headwear. That's fine, demos gonna demo. It was nice just to kill the head honcho for once. I don't think I ever made it to the mayor in the first game, yet here I have smeared his internal organs all over his dining room in just over an hour. A satisfying result by itself. What? Why are you looking at me like that? It's not like there's going to be a "pacifist" mode in this ga-- oh, there is.</p><p>At this point I could wander out and explore the city streets, take some career quests as a chef, or restart things as a (probably much shootier) soldier or cop. But my "let this simmer" sense is tingling. I was already willing to trust this sequel on the playful strengths of its predecessor (it's one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>). But seeing firsthand that much of the wackiness and freedom of the original Streets Of Rogue remains intact is doubly reassuring. You can play the demo yourself on Steam, should you too wish to bash a bodyguard through the wall and inject yourself with a bunch of syringes marked: "???"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has discussed the upcoming Project 007 game again. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview with IGN</a>, he openly said the goal is to make it a gaming franchise rather than a one-off project.</p>
<p><em>What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story. So, it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies.</em></p>
<p>Abrak also provided an update on development, saying that production at IO Interactive is going 'amazingly well.' That doesn't tell us when we can expect to learn more, but it's been nearly four years since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project 007 announcement</a>, and it might not be much longer until we get a proper trailer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, IO Interactive has just signed an agreement with Build a Rocket Boy to publish <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>, the triple-A single player story-driven action/adventure game created with Everywhere's engine. Abrak said:</p>
<p><em>We are honored to be the global publishing partner working with Build A Rocket Boy’s exceptionally talented team and to bring our community an exciting new IP. IO Interactive and Build A Rocket Boy are like-minded in how we aim to create a bond and a long-term relationship with our communities, which perfectly aligns with our commitment to delivering high-quality, immersive experiences to players worldwide. As our first publishing partnership, this marks a significant milestone for IO Interactive, and we could not be prouder of this collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Leslie Benzies, who produced GTA games from III to V at Rockstar, added:</p>
<p><em>From day one, Build A Rocket Boy Studios has been focused on creating the next generation of compelling gaming and quality entertainment experiences. We can’t wait to share our first AAA premium game and ever-evolving universe, MindsEye, with the world. There is no finer partner than IO Interactive to publish our first title, with their strong understanding of community culture, premium action-adventure games, and a best-in-class publishing team, we really look forward to partnering with them on our new blockbuster journey.</em></p>
<p>In MindsEye, players will become Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a mysterious neural implant who suffers from memory loss and flashbacks. They will embark on a series of dangerous covert missions to unravel the secrets of Jacob's past in a world filled with the constant threat of artificial intelligence, high-tech experimentation, corporate espionage, political corruption, and an unchecked military. According to the developer, they can expect complex narrative, rich environments, groundbreaking combat, futuristic technology, and high-speed chases. There's no release date yet, but you can add it to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> wishlist.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, KONAMI proudly announced that the Silent Hill 2 remake has sold over a million units globally across PC and PlayStation 5 as of October 11, according to the publisher's internal tracking. That's pretty impressive, given that the game only launched on October 8. It's another indicator of the game's great reception from critics and users alike. On Steam, the Silent Hill 2 remake didn't reach a massive peak, stopping at 23.6K concurrent users. However, user reviews are extremely positive, with 92.5% of the players leaving a favorable review. That's similar to the assessment provided by Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>, where he scored the game 9 out of 10.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-pc-is-yet-another-unreal-engine-case-of-stutter-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does have some technical shortcomings on PC</a>, mainly traversal stuttering, as in most recent Unreal Engine games. However, several mods attempt to improve the situation by adding certain lacking features, such as<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-fsr-3-frame-generation-nvidia-dlss-ray-reconstruction-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AMD Frame Generation and NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction</a>. Another mod aims to enhance overall performance while minimizing the visual downgrade. Still, the only real fixes for the PC version's stuttering can come from Bloober Team via patches.</p>
<p>By the way, the Polish team has heavily <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-expect-this-isnt-end-of-adventure-with-konami-bloober-team-silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the Silent Hill 2 remake won't be the end of their collaboration with KONAMI. Franchise fans are already wondering which of the other installments should be remade first. In any case, it will inevitably take several years; it's best to enjoy this remake and then move on until there's something concrete to announce.</p>

Designed to be used anywhere, the Colorsoft's front light will automatically adjust to your surroundings. The high-contrast screen has built-in anti-glare technology to help create the Kindle's signature paper-like reading experience, just with a full color palette this time around. While reading, you can highlight passages in color, which sounds like a nice little benefit for those who regularly like to revisit to share their favorite sentences.</p><p>Amazon has labeled the launch-model Colorsoft a "Signature Edition." This may sound a bit confusing since it's the only model available at launch, but Kindle Signature Editions offer a handful of upgrades versus lower-priced models: support for wireless charging, auto-adjusting front light, no ads, and 32GB of storage. Signature Editions also have metallic chassises. The Metallic Black Colorsoft checks all of the Signature Edition boxes.</p><p>Amazon says it's totally safe to read in the bathtub or the pool, as the Colorsoft has an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=18116670011&amp;ref=ods_me_waterproof&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IPX8 water resistance rating</a>. In lab tests, the Colorsoft still functioned after being immersed in 6.5 feet (2 meters) of fresh water for up to 60 minutes. You probably won't want to bring the Kindle with you in ocean, though, as it's only graded for three minutes of immersion at less than 0.8 feet (0.25 meters) of depth.</p><p>As mentioned, the Colorsoft is especially exciting for fans of comic books, graphic novels, and manga. Being able to read your favorite graphic novels in color on a paper-like display could bring those who have wanted to switch to digital but weren't keen on the idea of looking at black-and-white illustrations into the ereader community.</p><p>At $280, the Colorsoft is cheaper than the Scribe but a good bit pricier than the Paperwhite. Amazon is running one of its generous trade-in promotions for existing Amazon device owners that can save you some serious cash. Trade-in values for your old devices vary, but what doesn't change is the 20% discount on the Colorsoft. You'll automatically save $56 plus however much you get for your old device. Click the "Save 20% with Trade-in" banner below the price to instantly see trade-in values for eligible devices. It doesn't even need to be a Kindle. Other devices, including cheap Fire TV Sticks, can get you the 20%-off deal.</p><p>Amazon is also offering a deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Essentials-Plant-Based-Cover-Black/dp/B0DJ3RRNQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle</a>, which comes with a plant-based leather cover and a wireless charging dock/stand for $328. You're saving $35 by purchasing the bundle compared to buying the Colorsoft and both accessories separately. Cases are available to purchase separately, too. Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Paperwhite-Lightweight-Water-Safe-Protective/dp/B0DGNVSYR5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fabric protective covers</a> in three color options for $37, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Plant-Based-Lightweight-Sustainability/dp/B0DGNSVTFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leatherette covers</a> are $43. That means you'd spend $317 or $323 for the Colorsoft and one of the cases. The Kindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle is probably the way to go here, as you'll only spend $5-$11 more to get the charging stand thrown in, too.</p></div>                      </div><p>Color e-ink has become a trend over the past year. Kobo, Amazon's biggest competitor, released its own full-color e-ink reader in April. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXX465Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kobo Libra Colour</a> has a 7-inch full-color display and 32GB of storage for $220. But switching between brands after years of use is tough, as Amazon and Kobo have unique digital storefronts and file formats. You can't read Kindle ebooks on Kobo devices and vice-versa.</p><p>Most of the color e-ink tablets available now are more comparable to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a> as hybrid readers, note-taking, and productivity devices. For instance, Android e-ink tablet manufacturer Boox has released a few different full-color options, including the 7.8-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Tab-Mini-ePaper/dp/B0CCJCXN25?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Boox Tab Mini C</a> for $400, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air-ePaper/dp/B0CHF423CP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10.3-inch Note Air 3 C</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Ultra-Pro-Digital/dp/B0CHM54YZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10.3-inch Tab Ultra C Pro</a> for productivity for $650.</p><p>And then there's reMarkable, the manufacturer behind the most popular note-taking e-ink tablet not made by Amazon, released its own full-color tablet in September. The $629 <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1856639036910958843%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-ink-color-ereader-comic-books-new-kindle-models-2024%2F1100-6527202%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reMarkable Paper Pro</a> has an 11.8-inch display and is designed to replicate the experience of writing in a notebook.</p><p>Perhaps the next iteration of the Kindle Scribe will join the color e-ink party, too.

<p>Venturing down the road of competitive Fortnite, but not sure exactly how many ranks there are in competitive? The popular game mode is full of some of the best sweats in the game, making it a hefty challenge to move up. Here is a list of all the Fortnite ranks in order from worst to best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ranks">Fortnite Ranks</h2>



<p>The ranking system in Fortnite is similar to many other games as it starts with Bronze and then moves up. However, higher up in the ranking system is where the game differs from others.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all the Fortnite ranks in order:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>After Diamond, each ranking is no longer split up into threes. Elite, Champion and Unreal are all their own ranking.</p>



<h6 id="h-ranked-esports-events-calendar-2024-every-tournament-you-need-to-see">Ranked:<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-events-calendar-2024/"> Esports Events Calendar 2024 | Every Tournament You Need to See</a></h6>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-old-system">Fortnite’s Old System</h2>



<p>Did you know that Fortnite used to have a completely different system for Ranked? In fact, it was not even called Ranked, instead, it was titled “Arena.”</p>



<p>Arena first left the game back in 2023, when Ranked officially replaced it. So, what was Arena? Well, the game mode went off of points and not rankings. </p>



<p>There were three different divisions, Open, Contender and Champion. Players who wanted to compete in FNCS had to be in Champion League. Fortnite often played around with how many points players needed to reach Champion League, but it was usually around 6,500. </p>



<p>In some seasons, once you reached a specific division, you would not fall back below that division even if your points dropped below. This ended up changing later on until Fortnite officially released Ranked.</p>



<p>Would you like to see Arena return?</p>

Not just a mystery adventure, this is a heart-warming tale of character growth.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You are left all alone in the world after losing your last remaining relative, with only the apartment inherited from your late father.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Suddenly, a man appears and gives you—the new landlord—a warning.</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>Your time spent sleuthing out the cleverly disguised Yokai began from that moment.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>In this social deduction adventure game, the player uses the information they gather to find the Yokai who have attempted to blend in with the residents of the apartment building they manage.</p><p>But Yokai aren’t so easy to find. You will need to talk with residents, check the security cameras, and use the detailed information in the residents’ directory to gradually uncover the truth.</p><p>However, the Yokai may set traps in order to conceal their existence, causing the residents to become suspicious of one another. Just like in a Werewolf game, every word and action can sow the seeds of doubt.</p><p>As the landlord, it’s your duty to keep your residents safe, calmly gather information, and root out the true Yokai amongst the chaos.</p><p>And while you do, you’ll also unravel the true intentions behind the mysterious man who warned you about the Yokai…</p><p>Not just a mystery adventure!

Note down anything important that you hear.</p><p><strong>Check the Apartment’s Security Cameras</strong></p><p>Yokai are cunning. Even with security cameras installed, that doesn’t mean they will reveal themselves so easily.</p><p>But you might be able to catch them dong something that’s not quite human-like when they think no one’s looking, or something they normally wouldn’t do when in their human forms.</p><p>Behavior that appears ordinary at first glance could be a hint. Keep no stone unturned, and root out the Yokai.</p><p><strong>Evict the Yokai Upon Discovery</strong></p><p>Evict the resident after you have gathered enough evidence and identified them as a Yokai.</p><p>But be careful, if you mistake a real human for a Yokai and evict them, the remaining residents will become even more suspicious of each other, which is exactly what the Yokai want.</p><p>Stay calm during your investigations and keep the residents safe until the day of the new <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>, when the Yokai will reveal their true forms.</p><p><strong>If You Don’t Evict Them in Time…</strong></p><p>On the night of the new moon, the Yokai will display their true power.</p><p>When that happens, there will be nothing that we powerless humans can do.</p><p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p><p>We will also continue to make the interface compatible with translations.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.
