<p>In a series of changes and improvements being made to Escape from Tarkov in patch 0.14.9.5, Battlestate Games has introduced some interesting updates. One important mechanic will see players compensated for successfully reporting cheaters – but the reward itself hasn’t been clarified yet. This means that when you report someone and you’re notified that they’ve been banned, you’ll get <strong>something </strong>in the way of compensation, be it roubles, random items, or something else.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-for-nothing">Money for Nothing</h2>



<p>Presently, a change like this could make you a Tarkov millionaire overnight. It’s no big secret that the game is still being plagued by cheaters, and no server seems to be safe. At least now you’ll get a little something back in your pocket if you report these malicious operators and they’re kicked off the platform.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Battlestate Games revealed that soon, the newly introduced PvE mode will be available for purchase for owners of all game editions – and several changes are coming to <strong>that </strong>part of the game. First, improvements are on the way for AI PMCs in PvE, and the ability to reset your profile is also inbound. For solo PvE players, Battlestate is introducing local play, allowing users to get access to a game almost immediately, bypassing the need to queue for a server. </p>



<p>Tweaks are also being made to the in-game wishlist mechanic, new outfits are being added to the game (via Ragman), and a fresh questline called ‘Nostalgia’ is being added. Battlestate is bringing in an in-game poll system (but we’re not sure how it’ll work), and the team is pumping in a slew of quality-of-life changes.</p>



<p>This patch was supposed to go live this month, but it has now been pushed back to early July.</p>

<p>TwitchCon Europe 2024 is ongoing in Rotterdam, and to kick off the event, representatives of the platform announced changes coming to the ecosystem – as well as some interesting new features and mechanics that’ll change how the platform works. There’s nothing <strong>groundbreaking</strong>, but a few of these changes should increase collaboration and discovery, which are some of the most important aspects for new streamers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-starts-with-the-app">It Starts With The App</h2>



<p>Since 2019, the Twitch app has remained relatively the same in terms of its overall appearance – but that’s changing. In May, a test group received a new, upgraded look for their Twitch mobile app, and soon, it’ll be rolled out globally. This changes how users interact with the application, covering everything from the menus to new discovery feeds that give users direct access to algorithm-driven collections of clips. </p>



<p>It was <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/06/29/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-rotterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Twitch</a> that clips are one of the most important areas looked at in the recent round of changes. They’re being optimised on the platform for discovery, with Twitch bringing around a better flow for a feed that mimics sites like TikTok. Everything from clip creation to editing and ultimately sharing your clips has been improved – or will be in the near future.</p>



<p>Alongside tidbits like a new Enhanced Broadcasting Beta for NVIDIA-based streamers and the opening of an enrolment pathway for the new DJ program sat another juicy piece of information: Creator Clubs. Twitch is debuting a new ‘program’ that ‘helps streamers find communities around shared interests’. It’s social networking for Twitch, allowing users to join curated clubs, share content and make friends based on their likemindedness. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The reason Dr Disrespect got banned from Twitch is finally out there. Thank goodness. Now we can stop talking about him. We figured, however, that we’d dip one last bucket into that well by spotlighting the good work of Ash Parrish, our former Kotaku colleague turned Verge reporter, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a pivotal role in verifying the allegations</a>. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talked to her about how it all came together.</p><p>We begin by asking Ash what happened in the immediate aftermath (dot site) of an ex-Twitch employee’s decision to suddenly tweet out the reason behind Dr Disrespect’s ban last Friday. Why is that what it took to shake loose new sources, and how did reporters verify that they actually knew what they were talking about? Then we answer one of the major questions the recent torrent of information has produced: Why did it take journalists – some of whom had known the reason for years beforehand – so long to <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally make it public</a>? Why now? We also talk about the process of reporting out sensitive stories involving victims and <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we think will happen next</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, we move on to a discussion of<em> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, an expansion so divisive that it summons Chris Person from The Land of Shadow to share his misgivings. Lastly, we come up with a killer game idea based on the TV show <em>Severance</em> (call us, Apple).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can launch our own edgy streamer persona who [five seconds later] we regret to inform you that the edgy streamer persona <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake_Duck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a terrible person</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What happened on your end, Ash, that allowed you to confirm this after it had been so hard for people to figure out?</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> What happened with me was that this whole thing came out late Friday, and I received a message from someone who said they worked at Twitch on the trust and safety team, and that they had some additional context to share. And after a conversation with this person that was able to confirm some details and essentially prove they were who they said they were, we were able to publish a story that was essentially able to corroborate what Cody Conners – who was the Twitch employee who first tweeted it out – was tweeting.&nbsp;</p><p>And then from there, dominoes started falling. Cecilia D’Anastasio at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/youtuber-dr-disrespect-was-allegedly-kicked-off-twitch-for-messaging-minor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> was also able to publish a piece with a couple more sources from Twitch – firsthand sources that kind of shed light on this. And then after that, we got confirmation from Dr Disrespect himself that basically was like “Yeah, I did the things that they are saying I did.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That confirmation took the form of a <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> on his Twitter account. It wasn’t to any reporters or anything. In case people aren’t caught up on this nightmare we’ve been living in for a week.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Right. And so the reason he got banned is that he was exchanging messages via Twitch’s DM system – their Whisper system, is what it was called – with a minor in 2017, and these were explicit messages. Not the kind of thing that any sane adult should be exchanging with a minor. Basically what happened is, when Twitch caught wind of this in 2020 – as a result of somebody reporting it – Twitch moved extremely rapidly to ban Dr Disrespect.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what made it really hard for a lot of reporters to confirm it. When it first happened back in 2020, I tried to report it out and had a few different sources telling me “Here’s the basics of what happened.” It’s been the same story ever since. But those sources were like “Well, I wasn’t there at the time; I only heard this from somebody who was there. But I can’t give you their information. I can’t tell you who they are.” The reason for that is that the number of people who were there at the time – because Twitch sort of bypassed its own protocols to do this – was very, very small.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know if you heard this, Ash, but the impression I’ve gotten over the years is that it was maybe 10-15 people who were present or helped make the decision, and then most of the rest of Twitch was in the dark.</p><p><strong>Ash: </strong>That’s the key element to all of this, because one of the things that has come out now that this story is out so much is [commentary like] “Well, Twitch should be investigated because they covered up a crime” or “The journalists who are tweeting like they knew about it or heard about it were sitting on a story to profit” or whatever. The thing people don’t understand – that, Riley, you have written about – is we can’t just write about the first thing that comes across our desk.</p><p>Especially for a story like this, involving sensitive material like exploiting minors or big famous people with lots of money, you have to be airtight. You have to make sure that the things you are reporting are airtight from people with firsthand knowledge of the situation. For a long time, we didn’t have that. And now, because this person that I spoke to was on the trust and safety team at the time [Disrespect] was banned and had firsthand information on how all of that went down, we were finally able to report the way that we were.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> The response to me has been so interesting because I took the stance that it does feel weird. I don’t fault normal people for being like “What the hell?” after the tweet came out Friday night. I feel like there was a surge of people corroborating that they heard it. So I understand the reaction of “Wait, did everybody know about this?” But the situation has been useful to me, a journalist who always wants to talk about journalism, for talking about how journalism works. Our colleague Mikhail <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a really good newsletter</a> about why people haven’t reported on it. So it was exciting for me to see you get something out Sunday night. I feel a bit of pride that you and Cecilia [were responsible for corroborating the story]. I’ve been an editor to both of you, and I was like “Aw, my children!”</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Kotaku alumni. Hell yeah. There’s a funny personal story related to how all of that happened, but I don’t think this is the venue for it. But one day, I will share.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You can’t drop a bomb like that and then say “But later!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Here’s something you can maybe talk about: I’ve seen a lot of people say they want to see the proof, and people want to know how you know. I saw a lot of the less savory elements of the internet be like “Oh, that’s anonymous sources. That’s hearsay!” I know from being an editor that everything you report goes through a rigorous legal process, and I’ve done this with Nathan where you tediously go through every quote in a story checking and checking and checking, and I was wondering if you could speak at all to what process you went through on your end with The Verge.</p><p><strong>Ash: </strong>So the number one thing – and the thing that scared me about this initially – was, you always want to feel like the people who are speaking to you confidentially are speaking to you in good faith and that you can believe the things they’re telling you, because they’re taking great personal risk to do so. But you always have to be skeptical. So one of the things that we did to make sure before we reported what we did is [confirm] that this person is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels weird because it’s like “I don’t want you to believe that I think you’re lying, but I have to prove who you are. Are you comfortable with sharing that information with me?” To this person’s credit, they were. We were really grateful for that, because there are gonna be a lot of times when – especially when you get down to brass tacks in reporting a story like this – somebody will approach you and be like “I have insider information about this that I want to talk about, but I want to be anonymous,” and they’ll tell you their story, but then when it’s time to write the story and I need some clarifying information and I need them to prove who they are, they kinda get cold feet. They’re like “Oh shit, if I tell this person who I am – even though they’ve said they’re not gonna share my identity – I’m afraid that the things I have said could potentially reveal who I am.” And so they back out, and that’s how a lot of pieces die.</p><p>So thankfully this person who spoke to me did not get that kind of cold feet. They were able to be like “This is me, and this is what I did. Here’s all my stuff” – their bonafides that made it such that we could report it that way. And to Riley’s point about proof, with this specific case, involving the topics it involves – including potential exploitation of a minor and sexting – you cannot keep that kind of evidence. That’s not something Twitch wants to keep on its servers. That’s not something you want to personally possess.&nbsp;</p><p>So I understand this desire of “Let me see everything with my own two eyes,” but there are a lot of legal entanglements that prevent that kind of thing. So I understand why people want to ask that, but you don’t need to see it because, first of all, it involves a minor, and second of all, your chances of getting it are very low because companies don’t keep that shit on the books. Because they open themselves to a lot of legal liability if they do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’ve seen people like <a href="https://x.com/Tfue/status/1805971554062291272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tfue</a> say, like, “Show the Whispers.” And it’s like, OK well, this involves a victim. Even if someone somehow got their hands on the whispers, the victim may not have consented to those being shown. That could do potential harm to the victim both in terms of exposing their identity and also just in terms of showing something really sensitive from when they were literally a kid. That does emotional damage. That hurts somebody. The victim has not come forward after all these years. There is likely a reason for that. So to just show the Whispers for the sake of proving to people – who, by the way, will never be satisfied no matter how much evidence they see – that this is real, that just harms the victim.</p><p>I think on the internet there’s this desire for lurid detail. But what you need is all out there. Doc said he did it. Companies have dropped him after doing their own investigations. Journalists have looked into it. It’s all out there. The rest is just this desire for people online to be able to gawk at the absolute most heinous shit they can look at. And that, I think, is a really unfortunate instinct.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Newcastle had lost and, to make matters worse, Adams’ journey home was being delayed by snow. That is, it kept covering his windscreen and he had to repeatedly stop and get out of the car to clear it.</p><p>Some kind of innovation was needed. There had to be something that would help people see where they were going.</p><p>As it turned out, there was; a few years later Adams invented his own windscreen wiper. He patented the design and became one of several people from around the beginning of the 1900s credited with conceiving of similar devices, although his version of the windscreen wiper never made it into production.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>3D driving games had quickly become Reflections’ specialty, but the team knew you couldn’t tread water in a genre long famous for being on the cutting edge of video game technology.</p></div><p>Nearly a century down the track, Newcastle upon Tyne developer Reflections had found itself riding high on a purple patch of PlayStation success, propelled by the popular Destruction Derby series it had developed for legendary British publisher Psygnosis. 3D driving games had quickly become Reflections’ specialty, but the team knew you couldn’t tread water in a genre long famous for being on the cutting edge of video game technology. Some kind of innovation was needed. Something that would help people see where the future of driving games was going.</p><p>As it turned out, Reflections founder Martin Edmondson had just such an idea – and, unlike their fellow Novocastrian’s windscreen wipers, Edmondson’s idea <em>did</em> make it into production.</p><p>And it completely redefined what a driving game could be, forever.</p><p>Founded in 1984, Reflections spent the bulk of its first decade building action games for early home computers like the BBC Micro and Amiga, but by the mid ’90s it would become a house of horsepower. Reflections established its panel-punishing prowess on PlayStation very early; indeed, the original Destruction Derby was released in October 1995. At this stage, it had barely been a month since the original PlayStation had officially launched in the West.</p><p>A highly praised sequel arrived just over a year later, with a raft of technical improvements, and in 1997 Reflections released the competent but unremarkable Monster Trucks (otherwise known as Thunder Truck Rally in North America). However, while the Destruction Derby series would continue, the partnership between Reflections and publisher Psygnosis would not.</p><p>Unshackled from its publisher commitments, Reflections pivoted to something else. That something else was Driver, and it was going to be something special. GT Interactive certainly thought so. By December 1998, it was so impressed the publisher literally bought Reflections entirely.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-sf-1719314533004.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It's the original Driver San Francisco.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Driver, which first launched in June 1999, was unlike anything that had come before it. These days it seems less common for a game to come along and establish the foundations of what’s essentially a brand new sub-genre, but wind the clock back a couple of decades and it was happening with steady regularity. In the scheme of driving games, Driver was truly one-of-a-kind.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Driver did more than just take the brash, car chase gameplay from the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games and bring it to life in 3D.</p></div><p>Driver did more than just take the brash, car chase gameplay from the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games and bring it to life in 3D – it distilled the mayhem of some of Hollywood’s greatest ever car chase classics and made them <em>playable</em>.</p><p>Smokey and the Bandit, The Blues Brothers, The Cannonball Run, Bullitt – the team took inspiration from countless car chase classics. Martin Edmondson was particularly passionate about them; Walter Hill’s 1978 film The Driver was one of the first movies he ever saw at a cinema.</p><p>The Driver, a minimalist neo-noir action thriller set in the underbelly of LA, was not particularly successful upon its release – but it has amassed an admirable legacy. It didn’t just inspire Driver, that is; Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2011 film Drive respectfully shares several thematic similarities, it was a core inspiration for Edgar Wright’s 2017 film Baby Driver, and it’s been referenced on multiple occasions by Quentin Tarantino.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/the-driver-1719309397030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"Better get new plates if you plan on taking it out again."</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Driver’s influence on Driver the game goes far beyond the name, too. The infamous garage test at the beginning of Driver’s story mode was directly inspired by a strikingly similar scene in The Driver, where Ryan O’Neal’s unnamed getaway driver meticulously mangles a Mercedes (all while still keeping it drivable) in a calculated display of his precision driving abilities. The twist in Driver is that players are <em>punished</em> for denting the car. Ironically, doing so will trigger the very same car crash sound effect <em>specifically used in this very scene in The Driver</em> (alongside a host of other car chase movies from the ’70s and ’80s, mostly from 20th Century Fox).</p><p>Driver’s garage test is regarded by some as harder than any mission in the game that followed, although I can’t imagine that’s a sentiment that any Driver fan who actually played the game’s finale would share (‘The President’s Run’ is <em>monumentally more difficult</em> than the garage test). <a href="https://x.com/MrLukeReilly/status/1805566497772945505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playing and completing the test for the first time in many, many years</a>, I can’t help but wonder whether its reputation as an uncommonly gruelling challenge is a little overblown. Admittedly, Driver was essentially a religion for me during the last year-or-so of the original PlayStation so I’m not the best gauge – but I’ll note my 15-year-old son needed just four cracks to beat it, playing on original hardware. So I can’t say it stumped him, either.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-garage-1719314484732.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Show us what you can do!</figcaption></figure></output><p>That said, if you did in fact bounce off Driver because of its unfriendly first mission, you missed out on an absolutely amazing and unprecedented driving experience.</p><p>Sliding behind the wheel of a slate of '70s muscle cars as former race driver-turned-undercover cop Tanner, it was your job to lay rubber across four US cities – Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York – all in the name of high-speed justice. Each of these cities are fascinatingly distinct. Sun-drenched Miami features lengthy causeways and addictive bridge leaps, while San Francisco is packed with drastic elevation changes, trams, and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. LA’s missions occur exclusively at night, amplifying the seediness (and again paying homage to The Driver, in which director Hill deliberately shot all the chase sequences for at night). New York is a dense maze of grids and tunnels, framed with high buildings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/driver-ny-1719563982485.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The maps were incredible, but so too was the handling. Driver’s hulking American pony cars and land yachts weren’t exactly rapid or nimble by typical gaming standards for the time, but they were nonetheless outstandingly satisfying to throw into elbows-out powerslides and over huge jumps (where the era-accurate suspension would often see them bouncing a second time as the soggy springs absorbed their All-American bulk).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>From its flying hubcaps to its fabulous funk soundtrack, Driver’s dedication to bringing the spirit of ’70s and ’80s car chases back to life on PlayStation was dazzling. </p></div><p>From its flying hubcaps to its fabulous funk soundtrack, Driver’s dedication to bringing the spirit of ’70s and ’80s car chases back to life on PlayStation was dazzling. Sentimentally speaking, it’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/luke-reillys-top-30-games-of-all-time">one of my favourite games of all time</a>. Depending on what mood you catch me in, it may be my outright favourite, ever.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/driver-la-1719563740027.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Driver was a game I wished existed, and then suddenly it did.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For clarity, Reflections didn’t <em>quite</em> break through alone. Angel Studios’ Midtown Madness did, after all, speed onto PCs in 1999 also (a few weeks before Driver hit PlayStation). An open world racer set in Chicago, Midtown Madness set the tone for taking traditional racing to the streets. Open worlds would become the studio’s area of expertise, and Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) would later flex that strength in the likes of Midnight Club, Smuggler’s Run, and Red Dead Redemption.</p><p>Still, that Ubisoft has let the legacy of Driver languish since the release of 2011’s much-loved Driver: San Francisco is downright depressing. A groundbreaking achievement in every way, Driver deserves so much better.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That Ubisoft has let the legacy of Driver languish since the release of 2011’s much-loved Driver: San Francisco is downright depressing.</p></div><p>Today, Driver is a relic. In 1999, however, Driver was truly ahead of its time. A pioneer. Contemporaneous audiences agreed. Or, at least, the ones that could pass the first mission did. It’s one of the top 30 best-selling games on PlayStation, ever. Wedged roughly somewhere between the acclaimed super sequel Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 and monster hit Resident Evil 3, Driver was certainly no sales slouch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-miami-1719314583493.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It sold faster than a speeding Bullitt.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In other words, it’s more than some curio in the history of open world driving games that some gamers may otherwise believe began with the likes of Grand Theft Auto III.  </p><p>Perhaps you disagree. After all, all Reflections had to do was assemble four, enormous free-roaming city environments (the likes of which had never been built before), craft AI that could respond and effectively pursue players through them (which didn’t exist), compliment it with a class-leading vehicular damage system (that few racing developers of the era seemed capable of matching), and throw in a full replay editor for players to create custom car movies (on a console with 2MB of RAM).</p><p>Easy, right?</p><p>Well, in the words of Driver’s own tricky tutorial: show us what you can do.</p><p><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

		<p>We’ll be halfway through the year at the end of the weekend, which is one of those “Where the fork did all the time go?” moments in life. Still, at least it’s not quite as hot as it was earlier in the week, so you can have this existential crisis without sweating buckets at the same time.</p>

<li>And&nbsp;<strong>Andrewww</strong> has watching his daughter get spooked by Gone Home’s opening, before diving back into his playthrough of Ghost of Tsushima and trying out Dredge (which was just spooky enough for his son!).</li>
