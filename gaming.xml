			<p>At GDC 2025, 10 Chambers Collective invited Wccftech to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a> for the first time. After their debut title, the co-op horror-themed first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>, this is a return to the Swedish developers' true love: heists. Before 10 Chambers was founded, they worked at OVERKILL/Starbreeze to make the first two Payday games.</p>
<p>You can read our Den of Wolves preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-back-on-that-heist-biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. After the hands-on session, we were also able to interview writer and composer Simon Viklund to really dive into this new sci-fi setting they've created for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How do you feel that the reception's been so far?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a pretty pessimistic guy, but I think we're proud of the build. Obviously, otherwise, we wouldn't show it. We know what works in it and what works less well, and we're working on that. We know stealth may be a bit unclear right now, the feedback and stuff, but I feel that this demo, when it was put together, was very focused on combat and gunplay, which I think works well in it. The hit feedback, the sounds and the animations, everything is pretty tight.</p>
<p>We know how to do that stuff. We've been working on shooters for so long. But there are issues. We know it's unpolished in some parts, and some parts are obviously completely missing. I mean, there are animations missing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe your vision for how the game's flow will look, whether in the first early access iteration or when it's fully released?</strong></p>
<p>For early access, we will have one storyline. And for the full release, we will have multiple. We can't say how many at this point. There will be some things not present in early access. It will only be developed in English, with no localization at that point. We'll also use the early access phase to find out where people are enjoying the game and maybe focus on those territories in terms of whether there's voice localization. There are other aspects also that we're gonna hold off&nbsp;until later.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the important thing is the storyline, the ability to play different prep missions, choose which one to take on and avoid or reject others and play a heist at the end and see your choices throughout the prep mission phase sort of manifested, your choices having consequences.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The important thing is the storyline, the ability to play different prep missions, choose which one to take on and avoid or reject others and play a heist at the end and see your choices throughout the prep mission phase sort of manifested, your choices having consequences.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you talk about how dynamic these prep missions may be? Are there different mission types or rewards?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, every prep mission essentially has some sort of a MacGuffin that you're looking for. That's a plot device, really, which will unlock an approach in the heist at the end. You're looking at the heist, essentially. You need to get into the vault. It's a cliché, but let's take that. It's like, we can place an explosive on the weakest part of the wall around the vault, but then we need to play the prep mission where we acquire the explosives and we need to play another prep mission where we acquire the blueprints for the building to find out which wall is actually the weakest one. It's a nice climax to the storyline where you're playing this mission that you've been prepping for a long time and you've invested time and it matters more when you play it.</p>
<p>But then there might be other ways to get into the vault. Maybe you could drill, so you're like, let's find out what vault door they have and then you go into whatever company provided the vault door and find out what its weak points are. Maybe you could find out when the changing of the guard is happening, and then you play different prep missions to unlock the way. That doesn't entail playing all the premises, obviously, which in turn creates replayability because you can play the same storyline again and try a different approach.</p>
<p>The geometry of a heist would be the same every time. It's not a complex mission. The complexity, I would say, comes from your ability to play in several different ways, but it will be the same layout every time, whereas prep missions are more like, we're breaking into this bad warehouse or this laboratory or whatever. Those missions would not be narratively different. There's no different ways to do it. They might have a different layout every time you play them, as we randomize their layouts every time you replay the storyline. It's not procedurally generated, but it's us creating and curating a set of versions of that same map, which are then chosen at random by the game.</p>
<p>They're pretty straightforward in terms of what you do in them, and they're snack-sized in duration, but you have to keep on your toes because of the different layouts. With Den of Wolves, we're trying to really create a game where it's a lot of fun playing the same storyline several times because of player agency.</p>
<p><strong>When you finish all of your prep missions, you get everything ready for the main heist. If you either complete the main heist or if you fail, does that progression you've made through the prep missions stay, or do you have to start from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>When you have invested that much time into finding the different intel and the gear that you need in order to beat the heist, you get to try the heist several times. If it turns out that it's too difficult, you can go back to certain prep missions that might unlock things that aid you. You can maybe bribe someone or threaten some guards to look the other way. If you put more effort into more prep missions, that might alleviate a little bit of the pressure on the heist, so that's a way for you to offset the difficulty a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>With this being such a multiplayer-focused title, with these prep missions in Den of Wolves, when you're playing with a group of friends when you're going into the heist, is it based on the host progression, or is it a combination of the team for what they've done for their prep missions?</strong></p>
<p>Let's say I start a heist or initiate a storyline. I do it with the two of you, so we're three together. We&nbsp;agree on the rules that we need to be all three of us in order to make progress in this instance of the storyline. We play one evening and make some progress. The next evening, Robin can't join, but you and I can't play because we set those rules. Still, we can play either another storyline or start a new instance of that same storyline where we make progress&nbsp;and it's a little bit different.</p>
<p>But the next time all three of us are online, that version of the storyline, that instance where we play together, becomes available again. We can also start a storyline and say anyone can make progress in the storyline, regardless of who's online, or only I can make progress in the storyline, and whenever you guys are online, you can join in. You set the rules for yourselves, and then you can have essentially an infinite number of instances of the same storyline, just with different progress within them and stuff.</p>
<p>You can't collect stuff like resources in one instance of the storyline and bring it over to another version. However, if we're playing together in one storyline and you can't play one evening, I can still play in the same storyline without making progress. There are certain prep missions that are just collecting assets or resources, like consumables and stuff. Or I can be a gun for hire for other people playing their storyline, so I'm joining other people's games as a gun for hire and just protecting them and being sort of a bodyguard, not even completing objectives, just joining mid-game as a random player. That might reward me with stuff that we can use in our storyline.</p>

The next evening, Robin can't join, but you and I can't play because we set those rules. Still, we can play either another storyline or start a new instance of that same storyline where we make progress&nbsp;and it's a little bit different.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>When you say joining midgame, is this like dropping into a mission, or is this joining a party when they're still in their prep phase in the hideout?</strong></p>
<p>No, you can join in the middle of an actual first person shooter mission. When you start an instance of a storyline, you can say other people can join my game and they get to play with me just as if they were heisteri, really. But you can also say other people can join, but I don't wanna be robbed of the experience and the joy of completing the objectives. In that case, if my mission is to complete the heist, other people can't do that. They can't even interact with the vault door, or whatever it might be, so they're only allowed to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of incentives are there for Den of Wolves players to take the role of a gun for hire?</strong></p>
<p>They would get progress towards the next drop, just like you would when completing the heist. They'd be rewarded with gun parts or consumables like explosives and stuff like that that you can use in other missions.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider that to be more like a progression track or a reputation level system? Progression track meaning like a battle pass.</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's like filling out your golf bag with new gear and widening your arsenal with new stuff that you can use. They could be difficulty offset type of things, almost like a card that you would play in a card game. It could be something like calling in a favor from another criminal gang where they can attack another facility that is owned by the same company and that will thin out the security in this heist.</p>
<p>But it could also be something that allows you to find out about another extra vault that is available in this heist that you wouldn't otherwise know about or even be able to access unless you had this drop. Then you can go for that extra vault if you're greedy, but it's also a higher risk because it's more dangerous to stay on the map and try to get the stuff in that vault.</p>
<p>Players who want to play at an easier difficulty level will have to look for these things that help them when they think the game is hard, and people who want more of a challenge have the ability to play permutations of maps that ramp&nbsp;up the difficulty but also give them more reward for that.</p>
<p><strong>The system you're explaining sounds like a modifier system where players use cards before going into the heist to modify the enemy density or increase the rewards, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good way of putting it, but we're roleplaying it as some sort of favor or something from a rival team.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the player expression and customization in Den of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's a big part of it. It's something we like to explore and give the players the ability to do, but it's not necessarily something that exists as we're going into early access, but yes, we want the players to be able to customize the character and choose the voice and the face and the clothing and weapon customization.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There also has to be a point to playing longer heists as well, because what happened in Payday 2 was that players only played the same small bank over and over because it was the one that had the shortest loop and you got drops more easily. In Den of Wolves, we are trying to create a system that will reward you regardless of the duration of the heist that you're playing in relation to the investment in time and effort.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>That actually leads me to my next question, which is about weapon customization in Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>It's something that might not exist as we go into early access, but it might be added during early access. What I think it's important to point out is that you're not, like, stealing $1.5 million and now you have $1.5 million to spend on weapons, because then a pistol would have to cost a million dollars.</p>
<p>It's more like we roleplay it as you collecting money and then fencing those things off to some other criminal gang. After they got enough of that resource, whatever it might be, it's a currency of sorts (like the bags that you collect, the more bags you get, the more of that stuff you have to sell). Every once in a while, you level up or get to a point where you get a drop and a reward. It's not like we played this mission where we stole a shipment of weapons and now we have all these SMGs or AKs or whatever. You wouldn't be able to do that. There needs to be some conversion of your time spent in the game, a conversion between that and the reward that feels like it matters.</p>
<p>There also has to be a point to playing longer heists as well because what happened in Payday 2 was that players only played the same small bank over and over because it was the one that had the shortest loop and you got drops more easily. In Den of Wolves, we are trying to create a system that will reward you regardless of the duration of the heist that you're playing in relation to the investment in time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>Would customized gear drops be something that's permanently part of your arsenal, or would you only get to use them one time?</strong></p>
<p>No, that would be permanent.</p>
<p><strong>In the smaller prep mission, we saw a bit of GTFO's inspiration in the smaller discrete rooms that you would enter, clear out the encounter there, and then scan and go into the next room. So, I was curious how much of GTFO's DNA is present in Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>Well, there's a little bit of your DNA in each one of your children, I guess. I mean, we did the PC version of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and that had co-op. We've been working on and refining the co-op formula for a long time. Every new game is not so much inspired by our previous games, but more like a refinement, and maybe look at whether we are leaning into a certain direction with this thing?</p>
<p>Obviously, with GTFO, that was horror and hardcore difficulty. For this game, it's not that. I think it's somewhere between Payday 2 and GTFO, maybe closer to Payday 2, but still, it's not an entry-level first person shooter, but it is something that's less hardcore.</p>
<p>The sci-fi component, we feel, unlocks a lot of creativity. We're creating a world. It's not an existing IP; we can make the rules ourselves. We don't have to follow the lure or the backstory of some existing franchise, TV show, or movie, which is a huge creative freedom. It allows us a lot of liberty.</p>
<p>We can interject the gameplay with a change of pace and a change of environment, and the fact that you're in these huge megastructures where people live their entire lives within the same building. These are enormous places: you can live your entire life there and be born in the hospital in that building with its own grocery stores, schools, residential areas, slums at the bottom, and penthouses at the top.</p>
<p>That allows us to create really interesting levels where you're moving between different places and they're all segmented and they can be run by different private security firms and stuff and they're not necessarily communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Then we can have that thing that we had in GTFO, which we think was a huge step forward from Payday, where it's like stealth, stealth, stealth, and as soon as you get discovered, it's just action, and you can never go back to stealth again unless you restart. In GTFO you could sort of regain control and go back to stealth again, exactly the way you described, and that'll be possible in Den of Wolves as well. Losing it and then regaining it and coming back to that several times in the same mission is really nice.</p>
<p><strong>I've been sitting on this for a while, but I loved talking with you about music&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we did our first interview</a>. I was curious about what sort of lessons or new ideas you've come up with for the dynamic soundtrack to Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>On a technical level, it's somewhere between GTFO and Payday. Payday's music system is deceptively simple, rudimentary even. GTFO's music system is overly complex. I went on a rabbit hole with that game where it's like I'm making these short loops and they're all pieced together and layered in at one time by the game and the game can react to whatever is happening. The music changes and there are infinite combinations between the drum loops that are chosen randomly with a bass line that's chosen randomly and whatnot.</p>
<p>But it was not a lot of fun making the music because I only made these short snippets that then are arranged and put together by the game engine at runtime, so I never got to write really long songs. This is how the combat music works in GTFO, not so much the atmospheric music, but the combat music.</p>
<p>So I wanted to find a way to make the creation of music more stimulating and inspiring and fun again, so the music system needed to be less complex than GTFO. It goes for everyone involved in game development; I think you need to enjoy the journey as well. You can't just look at the end product and say, if it gets nice reviews, you're happy. You want to enjoy your life while you're making the game as well, and I need to enjoy making the music.</p>
<p>So yeah, the music needs to be larger chunks, like one minute, one minute and a half, two minutes, that I can make a song that has a little bit of changes going on through it. On a technical level, it's finding that balance between simplicity and complexity. On more of a creative level, in terms of the genre, I'm super happy to get back to making music for a power fantasy in Den of Wolves. It was fun making core music for GTFO, but it's not really my wheelhouse. Now I feel I can really utilize what I consider my primary skill within music, which is making music with a lot of attitude that gets the adrenaline pumping,</p>
<p>So, the music is electronic&nbsp;and saturated and distorted and dirty. A lot of it is inspired by hip-hop and trap. Trap music has a lower tempo, so it becomes not as stressful, obviously. It's slower moving and heavier in a way with these bass sounds and whatnot. It has a lot of street vibe and attitude to it, but I think it's really cool. What's nice about that slower tempo is that when you go double tempo, it's a natural transition into a more stressful track, so it's easy to go from 75 BPM to twice that tempo (150 BPM) and get a completely different vibe in the music.</p>
<p>When you're fighting the enemies and things are going well, there's one type of music, but when you're escaping and time is running out, the same track shifts into something else seamlessly. I think I find I've found a style of music that I think is really malleable and I can do at a great level.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any new artists or composers that you're collaborating with for the Den of Wolves soundtrack?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Jamie Christopherson, who I think might be most famous for making the music to Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. He's helping out.</p>
<p><strong>I think we talked about that in the first interview. I didn't know if there were any other announcements you could share.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, no, unfortunately not. I'm looking for rappers or vocalists who can contribute because when you come to the success screen, there's rap. The track from the escape as you were running out seamlessly goes to a rap song, and that felt like a good tone to strike with a lot of attitude as you sort of celebrate on the results screen. But I can't really announce at this point exactly who&nbsp;it will be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have a call to action or recruitment to try and find rappers to contribute?</strong></p>
<p>No, I haven't thought about that. I've looked at the avenues or the channels that I have at my disposal at this point, but that might be something that we use during the access when there's more of a community surrounding the game. It would be cool to find uh talents within the community.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We set the stage for interesting scenarios within this science fiction world with all the corporations and the concept of breaking into people's minds and everything. It's just a juicy concept that I think is going to excite people.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>After this whole preview cycle, when do you anticipate the next time that players can kind of get the next info drop for Den of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>We will be dropping a lot of beats actually this year. We'll be showing more and more, but the next one big like this, it's hard to say. Hopefully, for the beginning of next year we could have a whole storyline or at least more of it so you understand how the prep missions give consequences for the main heist.</p>
<p><strong>Any other parting thoughts you want to leave our readers with for Dead of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>We'd like to think that we know first person shooter co op games pretty well. We have a pedigree with Payday: The Heist and PD2 and GTFO and even Ghost Recon 20 years ago. Anyone who's a fan of that sort of game, and especially if they're into heists, should check it out; we'd like to think it's going to be pretty awesome. We set the stage for interesting scenarios within this science fiction world with all the corporations and the concept of breaking into people's minds and everything. It's just a juicy concept that I think is going to excite people.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game developers&nbsp;<span>who are part of the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union working at&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-runs-pro-union-ad-alongside-the-cwa-to-push-activision-blizzard-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's</a> subsidiary ZeniMax Media overwhelmingly voted in favor of giving their leaders permission to call a strike</span>&nbsp;after failing to reach a deal for the union's first contract after two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA), who helped the ZeniMax employees form their union, announced the news in a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">press release</a> on Tuesday, saying that members of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted <strong>94% in favor</strong> of authorizing strike permissions. Which, to be clear, just means that the leaders negotiating the deal with Microsoft now have the ability to call a strike. It doesn't exactly mean that a strike will happen.</p>
<p>"<em>We’re not afraid to use our union power to ensure that we can keep making great games</em>," said Skylar Hinnat, a quality assurance tester and member of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA.</p>
<p>Hinnat continued, "<em>All of us want to be working. We hope that Microsoft will allow us to do so with dignity and fairness to all by securing a first contract with our union."</em></p>
<p>Some of the key issues the ZWU-CWA is bargaining over are expanding remote work options, better pay, workplace improvements, and mandating that Microsoft inform the union of any intentions it may have to outsource quality assurance work to a third party.</p>
<p>Specifically on issues like return to office mandates, senior quality assurance tester and ZWU-CWA member Zachary Armstrong said, "<em>Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>None of us wishes it had come to</em> <em>this,</em>" he added, "<em>but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.</em>"</p>
<p>When the ZWU-CWA was formed at the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/quality-assurance-workers-microsofts-zenimax-studios-establish-companys-first-union">top of 2023</a>, it was the first union to come from a game studio under Microsoft, and it was also immediately one of the largest unions in the video game industry in the US.</p>
<p>As part of its campaign to push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through, Microsoft signed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a> to demonstrate that it would not prevent its employees from unionizing. Now that Microsoft has what it wants, it has seemingly yet to make good on any of the promises it made regarding its position towards unions and labor organizations.</p>
<p>"<em>Despite being one of the world’s largest corporations, we’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we’re asking for too much,</em>" said quality assurance tester Aubrey Litchfield.</p>
<p>"<em>Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?"</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The story behind the Metal Gear Solid Board Game is nearly as wild as the plot of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-games-in-order">Metal Gear game</a>, featuring a mix of delays and licensing issues, with odds stacked against it ever seeing the light of day before being rescued (much like Solid Snake rescuing Gray Fox) by CMON Games. But at long last, this cardboard adaptation of the Hideo Kojima masterpiece has finally reached the masses. From sneaking around in cardboard boxes to dynamic and exciting boss fights, the game’s tactical stealth gameplay has successfully made the jump from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games to board games</a>. However, the whole package isn’t without its faults, leaving me feeling both satisfied and let down at the same time.</p><div catalogid="f71f0ecf-f449-4d70-ad81-bc7b3b9d5ab7" id="217981"><div id="217981" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign-style board game</a> that retells the story of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid">first Metal Gear Solid game</a>, originally released on the PlayStation in 1998. Designed for one to four players (at least according to the box; more on that below), the game has players move plastic miniature versions of series favorites like Meryl, Otacon, Cyborg Ninja Gray Fox, and Solid Snake himself through 14 scenarios featuring iconic moments from the game, such as the confrontation with Ocelot, changing the PAL Keycard, and, of course, taking out REX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there is one significant omission that didn’t make the cut: the final confrontations between Solid and Liquid are not recreated as playable scenarios. It’s a bummer that neither the barehanded fight on top of REX nor the Jeep escape is included. Perhaps the developers couldn’t find a way to balance or explain a 4v1 battle on REX or figure out how the escape would work with all present characters. Instead, they've opted to end on the high note of a dramatic and memorable team-up against Metal Gear REX. But in the meantime, the fan community around this game has you covered. Over on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/296527/fan-made-scenario-stage-15-liquid-vs-solid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BoardGameGeek, user @Geoff907</u></a> and their wife devised and published their own unique Stage 15 for this game for you to try out, if you just absolutely need to get some of that shirtless fist-fight action into your game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you opt for the more expensive “Integral Edition,” the rest of the story bits that aren't told through gameplay are instead presented in a striking 109-page graphic novel with art by comic artist Kenneth Loh. It's reminiscent of the scenes in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker or the Digital Graphic Novels on PSP. But MGS wouldn’t be MGS without its CODEC calls. These little burst transmissions between Snake and his support team have been faithfully adapted to this new format, with prompts directing players to specific calls in the included Codec Book, as well as pre and post-scenario briefings. I particularly appreciate the care the developers have taken to make them just as campy yet informative as those in the video game. For example, Snake refers to how many actions he can take or offers tips on beating Psycho Mantis involving “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metal-gear-solid/How_to_Beat_Psycho_Mantis">Player 2</a>”-like trickery. Even as a game made of cardboard and dice, this still feels distinctly Metal Gear.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding gameplay, players take up to four actions per turn, chosen from those listed on their character’s unique player boards. As scenarios progress, players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box, which can be used in future scenarios. This equipment expands each character’s skill pool, effectively replicating the video game’s “procure on-site” philosophy. Once players take their actions, it’s time for the enemies to act. Both generic guards and bosses have action cards that dictate their movements and behaviors, which can change depending on whether they’ve spotted the player. Guards also have a separate reaction deck used in various situations, such as spotting a knocked-out guard or investigating a noise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss encounters pose their own unique challenges, forcing you out of your comfort cardboard box and requiring you to think on your feet. Each boss fight feels distinct, from Revolver Ocelot darting around while bouncing bullets off walls to the Hind D having multiple target areas to damage. Thanks to the game’s tile-based nature, each boss fight takes place on a unique, large board with special elements affecting the encounter. For example, in Ocelot’s arena, the injured Kenneth Baker can be hit and killed, adding a new way to trigger a game over. These special tweaks only enhance the excitement and tension of the encounters, as they are rarely designed to favor the players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This element of randomness kept me on my toes, never knowing exactly how far guards would move or which way they’d turn. The added dice rolls for checking if my actions made noise or if enemy shots would hit me resulted in an experience that balanced strategy with luck. There were multiple moments where I held my breath as I pulled a guard movement card, waiting to see if I’d be spotted. I never felt the game was unfair, but I also never expected it to be kind. Metal Gear does a superb job balancing strategy and luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the box suggests the game can be played with up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>, at least for the campaign mode, I wouldn’t recommend going beyond two players. Personally, I found playing it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> offered the best experience. Each scenario specifies which of the four playable characters can be used, with the first two scenarios playable only by Snake. Only five scenarios in the entire campaign allow for four players (with no missions designed for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>), and the first four-player mission doesn’t appear until the ninth scenario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a narrative standpoint, this makes sense. It wouldn’t be logical for Snake to infiltrate Shadow Moses with Gray Fox at his side or for Otacon to tackle Vulcan Raven alone. But from a board game perspective, this limitation significantly impacts the experience, making it hard to convince my MGS-loving friends to play when only one of them could participate in most of the game, while the others had to wait for the last few missions. I would have loved to see optional modifiers allowing additional characters in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> scenarios or “What if?” scenarios offering alternate viewpoints and player counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the game’s credit, the developers addressed this issue by allowing up to four players in the “VR Missions” mode. This additional mode, which includes its own set of special unlockable equipment cards, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">has its own caveat: a lack of content. The included VR Missions book features six mission types – Recon, Escape, and Sabotage, among others – but each type has only one associated map layout. While some tokens and traps may change between sessions, and you can swap in a boss model for extra challenge, the guard layouts and objectives remain the same. With the map never changing, once you know what to do, the mode quickly loses its luster. I hope that CMON or the community releases creative and fun new maps and missions to keep things fresh.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YOmrx?object_uuid=2a3bae9b-fd59-40a6-8568-380ae799f55d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Games Based on Video Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also check out our recent reviews of board games based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-cells-the-rogue-lite-board-game-review">Dead Cells</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review">Elden Ring</a>. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 1, 2025 6:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game successfully distills much of the tactical espionage action from the video game into an engaging and challenging board game adaptation. The gameplay and miniatures are the stars of the show, striking a great balance between creativity and strategy. However, restrictions on character selection and player count for most of the campaign make it difficult to play with a full group of friends. When paired with the limited stage options in VR Missions, what could have been a sturdy and impressive cardboard box ends up feeling like one that’s been tossed onto too many FedEx trucks on its way to delivery—functional but slightly battered.
If you’re a fan of solo play or want to experience the game with one other person, you’ll find plenty to love. But if you’re looking for a game to play with a group of three or more, you may want to think twice before diving in.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Run between them to avoid getting hit. After he sends out several of these, he will start to slam on the ground, raising chunks of ice that need to be jumped over. He will then raise on his hind legs for a second, giving whoever is controlling Zoe enough time to turn into her tree spirit and pull him to the ground. Once this is done, Mio should run over to his face and begin pummeling it. Note that sometimes, after sending out the shockwaves of ice, the Ice King will pause for a moment before resuming his attack. This is a trick to get Zoe to turn into the tree spirit which is unable to jump. Don’t fall for it. Make sure he is fully upright before trying to pull him down.</p><p>After dealing enough damage to him, the Ice King will cause icicles to litter the arena, culminating in a gigantic one in the center. Stand in the small spaces between or where the icicles have already fallen to avoid getting hit. He will then resume the pillars of ice, but this time, icicles will be falling as well. Continue moving to avoid taking damage.

The vortex will then disappear allowing Mio to turn into her axolotl form and jump in. There is a giant ball in the center that she can throw above the surface. Zoe must then use the tree spirit to catch it in midair and throw it at the Ice King to stun him. Have Mio race back to land and turn into her gorilla to throw a few more punches his way.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ice King will freeze the pool and repeat the vortex attack. Dodge as you did previously and he will use a new attack once the tornadoes clear which has him sending out bombs that follow you around. The trick is to dodge these attacks on top of the frozen pool to cause damage to the ice. Do this enough times, and the ice will break, allowing access to the plant ball again. Repeat the process to damage him once more and the Ice King will go down for good.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-recommend-id="image://6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-recommend-id="image://6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ice King can be a little tricky given his high number of AoE (Area of Effect) attacks; but a good way to avoid this is by keeping some distance from you and your partner so you aren’t both taken out by the same attack.

Over 300 quality assurance testers working on Bethesda franchises like <em>Fallout </em>and <em>The Elder Scrolls </em>have voted to authorize a strike following what they say are stalling negotiations with parent company Microsoft. “We’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum,” said Aubrey Litchfield, a tester on <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,194328,196698" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The QA department at ZeniMax, which operates Bethesda and was purchased by Microsoft for $7.5 billion back in 2021, voted 94 percent in favor of authorizing a strike, according to a press release by the Communications Workers of America on Tuesday. While that doesn’t mean a strike is currently in effect, it does mean the 300 members who are part of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA could initiate a strike if progress isn’t made at the bargaining table on their first contract.</p><p> “Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong in a press release. “None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.” </p><p> ZeniMax Workers United-CWA formed back in 2023 after the CWA cut a deal with Microsoft to support its bid to acquire Activision Blizzard in exchange for the tech giant remaining “neutral” on unionization within the company. Instead of fighting the process, Microsoft would voluntarily recognize any union with majority support among its members. Things sound less congenial at the bargaining table. The Bethesda union held a one-day work stoppage last fall and filed an unfair labor practice charge against Microsoft for outsourcing work. The Xbox maker disputes that it’s being unreasonable. </p><p> “Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>Kotaku </em>in an email. “We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair—if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.” </p><p>Quality assurance testers have long been one of the most exploited groups of developers in the game industry, forced to work long hours for low pay as studios crunch to ship massive games with as few delays as possible. But the work is also one of the most valued by players. There’s nothing worse than running into a game-breaking bug or watching your character randomly die while falling through the floor after an hour-long boss fight. Bethesda championed 2022's <em>Starfield </em>as one of its most bug-free releases in years, and it was. </p><p>Microsoft is currently bringing<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to PlayStation 5 this month, followed by the release of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in May. Bethesda’s next big release is expected to be <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, though the open-world RPG is likely still years away from coming out. A strike could potentially slow things down even further if a deal isn’t hashed out at the bargaining table.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-i-continues-to-soar-as-fifth-patch-is-released.1151367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The most sensational indie game of 2025 is one that nobody saw coming. It’s called Schedule I, and as the blurb goes, it sees players go ‘from small-time dope pusher to kingpin’ by making and selling all kinds of drugs. It’s bizarre, and it was pieced together almost entirely by a single developer over three years, and it’s turning heads worldwide.</p>



<p>Schedule I’s fifth patch is here, and it adds a few key improvements and addresses some outstanding bugs. Despite it being a little bit of a work in progress in some ways, Schedule I is one of the most popular games in the world right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-on-the-charts">High on the Charts</h2>



<p>Schedule I isn’t a game to be taken seriously, but many players are. It has picked up a rating of Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam from 38,778 reviews – and it was only released a week ago. It’s one of the boldest success stories we’ve seen from an indie game in a very long time.</p>



<p>It sits in the number one spot on Steam for sales, and it’s the fourth most-played game on the platform as I write this. There are 275,500 people playing it, and the game’s peak count has exceeded many AAA titles on the platform.</p>



<p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest patch notes</a> for Schedule I:</p>



<p><strong>Tweaks/Improvements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added an active display setting to choose which monitor the game displays on.</li>



<li>Botanists will now automatically move product from their supplies to drying racks.</li>



<li>Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app.</li>



<li>Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention).</li>



<li>Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter.</li>



<li>Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed a quest UI bug that was sometimes causing infinite loading screens in multiplayer.</li>



<li>Fixed clipboard selections not reassigning without first manually clearing the existing selection (employee beds, botanist supplies, etc).</li>



<li>Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed the first-person jacket looking janky.</li>



<li>Fixed the ‘Master Chef’ achievement being rewarded prematurely.</li>



<li>Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues.</li>



<li>The drying rack ‘dry’ button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC ‘stay in building’ behaviour sometimes causing errors for non-host players.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC voiceover emitters sometimes throwing a null reference.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s creator and (almost) solo dev, Tyler, also revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started work on the first content update and am planning to release it this weekend. I’ll be posting some sneak peeks soon – stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schedule I is available exclusively on PC at the moment, and if you want to try before you buy, the game has a decent demo on Steam.</p>

This will be a limited-time event that likely will last until the launch of the new expansion of Destiny 2, currently only known as "Project Apollo" from Bungie's 2025-2026 roadmap. But the specific end date is unconfirmed.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these three featured dungeons previously requiring a Dungeon Key from their respective expansions, <strong>Rite of the Nine will be free for all players</strong>. That means anyone with a base copy of Destiny 2 can play the event while it is live.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will be focused solely on dungeons in a similar vein to the Pantheon challenges from Into the Light. Three dungeons will be featured on rotation: <strong>Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher,</strong> and <strong>Ghosts of the Deep</strong>. The Rite of the Nine event adds a slew of new difficulty modes, updated loot, and a revamped farming system to earn loot on repeated runs.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have access to a new social space called <strong>The Third Spire</strong>, which is a revised version of the old victory space from Trials of the Nine when players completed a Flawless run. Here, players can visit an old ally, the <strong>Emissary of the Nine</strong>, for access to all the new rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Each week, one dungeon will be listed as the featured dungeon and players will engage in various challenges in that one dungeon. There will be three difficulty options available, allowing players of all skill levels to earn something. For players willing to take on the highest difficulty, special loot is up for grabs.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will feature 12 revised weapons from past encounters with an all-new selection of perks. Adept versions will be available earned if dungeons are completed on the highest difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">A new Origin trait called <strong>Gravity Well</strong> will be exclusive to these weapons. Along with the initial Origin perk in the fifth column, Gravity Well will also be able to be chosen as an option. Gravity Well's effects are listed as "Reloading this weapon automatically gathers nearby ammo." It's not known exactly how far away this takes effect, but the perk seems to gather any nearby ammo bricks on the ground, Heavy or Special, and pull them to your character on a reload.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also visit the Emissary of the Nine in the Third Spire space to attune their loot drops from dungeon completions. Similar to how the Brave Arsenal worked in Into the Light, only one attunement can be active per run, and this will increase the likelihood of obtaining that weapon as a reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Players who finish a dungeon on the highest difficulty,<strong> Ultimatum</strong>, will be able to earn an Adept weapon. These weapons have a unique shader effect on them making them glow and shimmer. Adept versions of weapons will also have boosted stats over the normal versions, so they will have an upper hand over normal drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the 12 weapons coming with Rite of the Nine:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prosecutor</strong> Auto Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Relentless</strong> Pulse Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Judgment</strong> Hand Cannon</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>A Sudden Death</strong> Shotgun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wilderflight</strong> Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Long Arm</strong> Scout Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Liminal Vigil</strong> Sidearm</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Terminus Horizon</strong> Machine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>New Pacific Epitaph</strong> Breach-loaded Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Survivors</strong> Submachine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greasy Luck</strong> Glaive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cold Comfort</strong> Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Other rewards from Rite of the Nine also include <strong>five new Emblems</strong>, <strong>a new Title/Seal</strong>, and <strong>weapon ornaments.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine's rotating dungeons are broken up into three difficulty tiers, allowing players of any skill level to earn something and experience a challenge. Each mode changes aspects of the dungeon, such as displaying helpful tips to the rather difficult "Notswap" modifier. Here's how each one is broken down.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This mode is essentially "Beginner Mode" with an incredibly forgiving difficulty level and much less harsh punishments for wipes and party deaths. While we don't know the maximum Power level for these dungeons yet, we can assume it will be a low bar to clear. The rules for Explorer Mode are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Darkness Zones.</strong> Normally when players come across a Darkness Zone, if the full time dies with no revives available, the encounter resets back to the start of the last checkpoint. In Explorer Mode, Darkness Zones are completely disabled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Revive timer is only five seconds.</strong> Revive Timers in dungeons typically range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds. In Explorer Mode, they are much more forgiving so players can be revived more quickly.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Tooltips explain mechanics.</strong> Before beginning the encounter, tooltips will be visible that explain how each encounter basically functions. New players will be able to immediately pick up on these tips and execute their mechanics.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Waypoints guide players</strong> during more open sections of dungeons. These will constantly be visible to guide players to the next objective.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Helper platforms</strong> appear when a player reaches a checkpoint, helping those who struggle with jumping puzzles.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">Bungie has not shared the full details on how this mode will work, but it is likely more geared towards casual players seeking a challenge. It's possible most of the standard rules for dungeons will be present here such as Darkness Zones, longer revive timers, and possibly even more strict timers on certain encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be a scoring mechanic live in Eternity Mode that will gauge players' performance based on time spent on an encounter, enemies killed, and revives remaining after an encounter is completed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the highest difficulty level for Rite of the Nine. Basically this is only where the best of the best can thrive. It's likely this will have a lower power cap and feature lots of extra modifiers to make the encounters much more unforgiving and difficult to navigate. The rules that we know of so far are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contest Mode difficulty.</strong> Much like when a raid is live for the first time, players will be at least 20 levels below the Power level of all enemies in the dungeons. Enemies will also be much more aggressive, shooting more often and running towards players whenever possible. Limited revives will prevent players from completing encounters if they run out.</li><li dir="ltr">"<strong>Notswap" Modifier.</strong> Notswap is a new modifier where, if a player swaps an Exotic armor, a weapon, or a class, all of their energy is drained to zero. All cooldowns will be reactivated, the Super gauge will be set to zero, and they will have to regain all energy to use abilities again.</li></ul><p>Scoring will be based on deaths.The fewer deaths accumulated through an entire run, the higher the score will be. If players achieve a <strong>Platinum</strong> score, they will receive an <strong>Adept</strong> weapon at the end.</p>

<p>Rebellion is celebrating the successful launch of Atomfall, a pseudo-apocalyptic survival game set in rural England in the 1950s. It’s a history-bending title with plenty of mysterious meat on some well-built bones, and that’s partly why <strong>one million players </strong>found their way into the game over the launch weekend.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team revealed that Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch <strong>ever</strong>, and the company has been making games for more than thirty years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-is-here">The End is Here</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/">my Atomfall review</a>, I praised the game’s solid foundation, genuinely intriguing story, and sumptuous visuals, topics that have been mirrored by players worldwide. It’s a phenomenal concept for a game that has been delivered very nicely by Rebellion after years of development.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Jason Kingsley CBE, the CEO of Rebellion, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall.</p>



<p>To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p>



<p>We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p>



<p>We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.</p>

<p>The team released some statistics along with the news, revealing that 316,000 people brutally murdered the innocent scientist who helps the player at the very start of the game.</p>



<p>I was one of those 316,000 people.</p>



<p>Also, 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed, which is nothing if not indicative of how <strong>quintessentially British </strong>Atomfall is.</p>



<p>Atomfall is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC – it’s also on the Game Pass subscription service.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Preston ‘Priestahh’ Greiner has split from Los Angeles Guerrillas M8 in the Call of Duty League following a turbulent time for the team. Presently, LAG sits one from the bottom in the CDL standings, sitting on a match record of 4-15, which is fairly woeful. The only team behind LAG is the Vegas Falcons, which has yet to win a single match in the CDL.</p>



<p>Priestahh has been passed from pillar to post since his monumental season in 2023 that saw him secure two chips and a world championship, and it’s hard to tell where he’ll end up next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fall">The Fall</h2>



<p>During the 2023 CDL season, Priestahh saw immense success while playing an integral part in the New York Subliners roster. He was a member of the crew that landed one of the most historic grand finals in COD Champs history – a 5-0 wash over Toronto Ultra that ended in record time.</p>



<p>As a tenured veteran of Call of Duty esports, Priestahh has been around since Advanced Warfare (2014). He has flown the flag of some prestigious organisations, including 100 Thieves, FaZe, Cloud9, and now Gentlemates, represented in the Call of Duty League by the Los Angeles Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>LAG has failed to gain any traction this season, though. The team has been hampered at every post, and it’s looking extremely likely that the squad won’t make it to this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">COD Championship tournament</a>, set to take place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On March 18, LAG M8 started breaking down the roster, bidding farewell to Skyz – who has since wound up starting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/">with OpTic Texas</a> in place of Kenny. On March 27, Lynz was pushed to the sub spot, being benched by LAG M8 after a crushing defeat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-lan-3peat-major-ii-finals/">at Major II</a>. Two days later, Priestahh was benched – and now he has departed the team entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nous disons au revoir à </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> , qui quitte le club aujourd’hui

Merci Preston, nous te souhaitons le meilleur dans tes prochaines aventures 🩷 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Rostermania has been pretty wild so far during the gap between Major II and Major III. This coming Friday, matches will return, but will everyone be too distracted by the resurfacing of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/former-sony-exec-says-its-about-time-for-playstation-to-reconsider-its-focus-on-cutting-edge-graphics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has been sharing quite a few insights on the games industry since his departure from Sony. Among them, he says it might be time for Sony to reconsider its adherence to cutting-edge graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (translated via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said it's time for PlayStation to reconsider its focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken Kutaragi]'s time," Yoshida said. "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best (in terms of graphics quality) to those who want it," Yoshida continued. "But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's little doubt that games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, or other major Sony exclusives have put a lot of focus into graphical fidelity. Yet Yoshida's comments indicate it might be time to reconsider approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's a focus on relatively smaller experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, or a complete pivot to lo-fi or stylized graphics, it's not suggested. But with the price of making a big, AAA game like those in Sony's stable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">seemingly only going up</a>, fresh approaches might be welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only insight Yoshida has shared in his interview rounds. The former PlayStation exec <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-convinced-it-to-stop-chasing-overseas-trend">also discussed NieR: Automata's impact on the games industry</a>, especially in Japan. Whether that's the blueprint for a renewed approach to games or not, I certainly wouldn't complain about more games like NieR: Automata going around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/den-of-wolves-hands-on-preview-payday-meets-inception-in-this-mind-bending-co-op-heist-simulator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Usual Suspects are back up to their old tricks.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It honestly shocks me that there aren’t more heist games, because I can think of few experiences more awesome than carrying out my boyhood lawbreaking fantasies with the lads. Thankfully, after more than a decade away from the glamor and gunpowder of criminal activity, a group of familiar faces behind Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 have taken a break from making the insanely difficult co-op shooter GTFO to go back to what they do best. And that is, make games where you and your friends work together to break the law by pulling off a series of elaborate and high-risk burglaries for no other reason than to satisfy your wanton greed. But where the Payday series was and continues to be a fairly standard game about robbing banks, the upcoming Den of Wolves adds a compelling sci-fi world with a gritty, cyberpunk flair, multi-phase planning and execution of break-ins where you can decide exactly how you want to pull it off, and most importantly: the ability to dive into the minds of others to steal the valuable secrets hidden within their brains. If that doesn’t get your blood pumping, I don’t know what will!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den of Wolves takes place in the extremely dark near future where the world’s technology ecosystem imploded due to hackers, and corporations were given free rein to do whatever they pleased to combat the crisis, including but not limited to human experimentation, and building dangerous and unpredictable technologies (y’know, your basic cyberpunk hellscape stuff) so long as they kept their activities contained to the newly minted libertarian dystopia and Andrew Ryan’s wet dream: Midway City. Naturally this leads to corporations storing their data straight inside totally unhackable human brains, transforming the host to all that delicious data into a wonderful little flesh battery, from the looks of it. But we’re hardened criminals, guys. Are we really gonna let a super creepy meat computer locked away in a bank vault get in the way of us pulling off heists? I think not!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Den of Wolves GDC 2025 Preview Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Den of Wolves has you and three friends planning and carrying out a series of felonies in Midway City, where you’ll overcome those pesky brain-based security systems by mind-melding with victims to rip off their secrets and make off with the loot. My demo focused on a single operation where my crew and I planned and executed a high-stakes assault on a bank currently under new management by a very aggressive street gang with power and tech enough to rival world governments – pretty nasty stuff. In this particular case, our plan of attack was to use a swarm of drones acquired from a previous robbery to ambush a number of these gang members to gain entrance into the reinforced stronghold, then go loud as possible, shooting up the place with reckless abandon until we found what we were looking for. In this instance, the big prize was the data inside someone’s head who was locked safely away inside a vault and scarcely resembled a human anymore; truly just straight nightmare fuel, if I’m being honest.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll mind-meld with victims to rip off their brain's secrets and make off with the loot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this caper went off in a way any Payday fan will immediately recognize: we used a variety of automatic weapons to smash and grab everything in sight while holding off waves of folks who were quite mad about being ripped off, deploying and repairing drills that break every couple seconds even in a sci-fi future, apparently. Naturally, cooperation was critical to our success, as we laid down cover fire for one another, revived downed teammates who got caught in a bad spot, and called out to one another as we heaved bags full of loot across the ruined fortress. There really wasn’t a whole lot new about the foundation of this heist game, aside from maybe the consumable equipment abilities that let my squad do things like throw down a temporary barrier that provided some limited cover in the middle of a fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that changed when the bank vault doors slid open, revealing the prize we were chasing after: a caterpillar-like human lump locked away to contain valuable secrets. After a little bit of hacking, we lept from the physical plane and into the mind of this person to hack open their brain and make off with their secrets. Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on in the mind of this clearly and understandably disturbed individual, but what we found waiting for us inside his dome was an unsettling and surreal series of landscapes that we had to leap between to gain access to their thoughts. And since we were on a timer, we couldn’t afford to take our time or slip up, lest we get booted back out to the real world and have to continue to hold out against enemies before getting another crack at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the only brain I dove into in my limited time with Den of Wolves, but I was told that every mind would present unique challenges to play against, not just the high-stakes platforming of our current mission. And while it remains to be seen just how interesting or how much variety these will have, this section completely shook up an otherwise familiar formula in a seriously cool way. I love shooting at rival criminal gangs and robo cops as much as the next convicted felon, but it was really neat to jump back and forth between reality-based FPS combat and completely bizarre cooperative platforming in a geometrically impossible world of imagination. That really helps to set this one apart from what I worried might just be a Payday sequel with a cyberpunk skin plastered over it. Instead, it seems Den of Wolves plans on taking some real risks and trying stuff that makes it weird and interesting, and I’m absolutely down for that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In between trips into our poor, troubled victim’s mind, we were yanked right back out to where we left off, only milliseconds apparently having elapsed in meat space while we went parading around in someone’s noggin. After jumping back into his skull for a few additional servings of deeply uncomfortable jumping puzzles, we got what we came for and made our exit by blowing up some windows with high explosives and diving out to what I can only hope was some Assassin's Creed-style hay piles waiting conveniently placed just below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Den of Wolves borrows quite a bit from Payday and other crime games, the setting, elaborate planning mechanics, and especially its surreal mind-hacking mechanics all made me feel pretty confident that developer 10 chambers’ return to the wonderful world of heisting has a good chance of being another stunning success. Here’s hoping they can pull off the score of a lifetime when this thing eventually makes its way into early access on PC.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But should contract negotiations break down, the ZeniMax union now has the permission to call a strike.</p><p>This authorization comes as contract negotiations between union members and parent company Microsoft continue into a second year.</p><p>The strike authorization is the latest escalation between the union and management.

When will enough be enough?”</p><p>“Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United is one of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202271/bethesda-game-studios-workers-unionize-cwa">several</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">unions</a> under the Microsoft umbrella.

                <p>Developer Rebellion is perhaps best known for the Sniper Elite series, but the UK's studio latest release, Atomfall, is now the developer's "most successful launch" in its 32-year history. </p><p>Atomfall launched in full on March 27 and reached 1 million players over its first weekend, climbing further to more than 1.5 million so far. The post-apocalyptic survival game was inspired by the real-world <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Windscale-fire" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windscale nuclear incident </a>in the 1950s. The game has been referred to by some as "British Fallout."</p><p>"To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion," the developer's CEO and co-founder, Jason Kingsley, said in a statement. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</p><p>Rebellion also shared some other stats from launch, including:</p><ul><li>316,000 players killed the scientist at the start of the game</li><li>Players have used the cricket bat 3.7 million times to rack up kills.</li><li>More than 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.</li></ul><p>Atomfall no doubt benefitted in terms of player numbers by launching into the Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass game catalogs. Rebellion did not, however, say how many copies of Atomfall have been sold across all platforms, including Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC.</p><p>In fact, there is no indiciation at all as to how Rebellion is measuring success for Atomfall. Also unknown is how much Atomfall cost to develop or market. As always, game development budgets remain mysterious. What we do know is Atomfall is not Rebellion's first Game Pass day-one release, as Sniper Elite: Resistance was a Game Pass launch as well.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomfall-review-bunker-thrill/1900-6418348/" data-ref-id="1900-6418348">Atomfall review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Atomfall is a good game that sometimes gets in its own way, but it's the process of finding your unique path through its story that will stick with you after the dust settles."</p>

If you're a fan of locomotives and fiendish deck-building strategy roguelikes, you've probably long been in the grip of developer Shiny Shoe's massively acclaimed Monster Train. So you'll likely <em>also</em> be thrilled to hear its previously announced sequel finally has a release date - and is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 21st May.
</p>
<p>
Shiny Shoe's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-train-brings-a-new-idea-to-a-genre-i-love">original Monster Train released back in 2020</a>, plopping players onto an infernal locomotive destined for the heart of a frozen Hell. Here, they were tasked with fending off Heaven's forces - and, crucially, protecting the train's burning pyre - through strategic bouts of real-time card battles playing out across multiple floors of the train. And good stuff it was too, still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/">boasting an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' Steam rating</a> four years after its release.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Monster Train 2. This time around, Heaven and Hell's denizens have formed a makeshift alliance to bring down the powerful Titans - in an adventure taking players through Heaven, Hell, and the mysterious Abyss. To aid in their quest, Monster Train 2 introduces five new clans, new units, new upgrade cards, and dangerous new enemies. That's alongside the new Room and Equipment card types - the former providing special boosts to the train itself, and the latter providing bonuses to units when applied.

<p>
On top of that, there's the new Covenant Outpost, which players can visit between runs. Here, they'll experience character interactions as the story plays out, and gain access to different features. There are unlockable Pyre Hearts, for instance, each said to add unique functionality to gameplay, alongside train customisation and an improved Logbook.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Monster Train 2's story is complemented by Dimensional Challenges - promising handcrafted challenges, new Mutators, and cosmetic rewards - as well as Daily Challenges, an Endless mode, plus the Celestial Alcoves where players can experience a "wide variety of random events... and maybe even a few surprises" from beyond the Monster Train universe.
</p>
<p>
Monster Train 2 launches for Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 21st May. And if you're curious to see what's new, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">demo's available now on Steam</a>.

			<p>Today, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new trailer for the highly anticipated game Elden Ring: Nightreign. The video is dedicated to the Ironeye class, one of the classes players will be able to pick while in the game.</p>
<p>According to the official brief, the ethos of the Ironeye is to strike from afar with ranged attacks and deadly precision. They start with a bow and specialize in dexterity-based weapons. The class brings damage and utility to parties brave enough to sojourn into Limveld. Experienced players will also recognize the usefulness of ranged attacks - being able to revive downed party members from a distance during a run can make the difference between surviving the night and not living to see another day. While the Ironeye starts with ranged attacks and has ranged Ultimates, like all Nightfarers, they can use any weapon they discover during a run.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Ironeye Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There will be four more classes (or Nightfarers, as they are described in the game) in Elden Ring: Nightreign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wylder - A balanced all-rounder, effective both in speed and attack power.</li>
<li>Guardian - A tank with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance.</li>
<li>Duchess - A nimble hero with quick attacks and a strong evasive ability.</li>
<li>Recluse - A caster with ranged magical abilities and a healing-based skill</li>
</ul>
<p>These Nightfarers still have to get their dedicated trailers, though. This is likely to happen in short order, given that the game is less than two months away from its planned May 30 launch date.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking out Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> during the recent Closed Beta Test, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo was eager to play more:</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</em></p>
<p>In less than eight weeks, we'll know if FromSoftware can deliver another hit even in a spin-off game dedicated to multiplayer.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-very-likely-to-support-4k-resolution-output-new-findings-suggest.1151247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doom and gloom settled on Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/">yesterday</a> when it was revealed that the system's devkits don't support 4K resolution outputs. However, there's a good indication that this won't be the case, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4194#post-1702829">Famiiboards forums member Serif</a> provided some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jozskd/the_switch_2_dock_uses_a_realtek_rtd2175ncg/">additional details</a> about the dock's Realtek RTD2175N-CG chipset. Information on this precise model cannot be found online, but the closest model, the RTDN2173 chipset, which is likely a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch 2 dock's chipset, supports DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI HDCP 2.2/1.4 and HDR, as well as video resolutions from 720p up to 8K60Hz, so the dock will be able to output 4K resolution, although it remains to be seen if 4K resolution will be supported by games. Still, even if 4K resolution output is only limited to the system's UI, it will still be a massive improvement over the original Switch, whose interface looks terrible on large 4K screens.</p>
<p>Even without the unlikely lack of 4K resolution support, the Nintendo Switch 2 is setting up to be a massive upgrade over the original system. The console's controllers will also receive some significant upgrades, as the new Pro Controller will likely feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a>, suggesting better voice chat support for the new system as well. Thankfully, it won't be long until we finally learn everything there is to know about the Nintendo Switch 2 and how much it will actually be an improvement over its predecessor, as the console will finally be fully unveiled tomorrow, April 2nd.</p>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct almost upon us, details about the upcoming console’s Pro Controller have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrades-nbsp">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Upgrades&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4192#post-1701204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/227778/news/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), FCC Filings for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller have been revealed, providing an idea about the new upgrades for this device. The filing has been listed for ‘BEE-008’, a controller with both Bluetooth and NFC. Interestingly, the filing suggests that Nintendo could finally add a headphone jack to their Pro Controller for Switch 2.&nbsp;Moreover, the controller should feature a new battery, too.</p>



<p>The community has long requested a headphone jack for the Pro Controllers. When the console is docked, wired audio is impossible unless you are glued to the TV. However, with the upcoming console finally introducing voice chat for the platform, a headphone jack for the Pro Controller seems more likely. We will have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event tomorrow to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-last/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last one hour</a> and explain everything we need to know about the upcoming console.

<p>Compulsion Games is ready to bring the world South of Midnight. Its release date comes several years after its announcement, and the developer is preparing everyone for its debut by showcasing start times for its normal and Early Access launches.</p>



<p>If We Happy Few is anything to go by, then we already know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-of-midnight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a> is a can’t-miss adventure. Xbox shares Compulsion Games’ affinity for the weird and wonderful, and this is the first project under the Xbox banner. South of Midnight looks like a mature and realized vision, and its release date can’t come soon enough for some. </p>



<p>If you’re after the earliest possible start time, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-release-date">South of Midnight Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Magical and mysterious. Credit to Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>April 8 is the confirmed South of Midnight release date, and it’s one of the month’s biggest games.</strong></p>



<p>South of Midnight—at the time of writing—hasn’t been subjected to a delay. It’s had little-to-no controversy and got a lot of hype ahead of its launch. It’s available to Xbox Series X|S and PC users, so let’s see if being available on these platforms helps its sales.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight being on Xbox Game Pass</a> is sure to go in its favor.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-start-times">South of Midnight Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Expect South of Midnight to launch and get underway at 9 AM PDT / 11 AM CDT / 12 PM EDT / 5 PM BST.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is for the official launch date. South of Midnight’s release has several editions to consider, so depending on which one you opt for, there’s a chance you’re entitled to Early Access—giving you an earlier start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-early-access-start-times">South of Midnight Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The Premium and Premium Upgrade Editions come with five days of South of Midnight Early Access.</strong></p>
