            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has confirmed work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, is still ongoing, despite pausing development to focus instead on Stardew Valley updates.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/">new blog post</a>, the creator noted it had been "a little sad to see Haunted Chocolatier getting dusty on the shelf", but as he got involved in the Stardew Valley 1.6 update as it grew from technical changes to content additions, it "kind of snowballed" and pulled him away from the next game.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">1.6 update arrived on consoles last month</a>, meaning Barone is now free to continue development of Haunted Chocolatier.</p>

<p>Barone explained his "strong sense of duty and obligation" to Stardew Valley players, but said he has a "strong desire to make more games".</p>
<p>"I like making games, and I have a lot more that I want to share, with Haunted Chocolatier and beyond," he wrote. "And even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree, in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas."</p>
<p>Before the release of 1.6, Barone had a "vertical slice" of Haunted Chocolatier, with the skeleton and most of its bones in place.</p>
<p>"My next task will be to tweak the existing bones until I'm happy with them, add all the rest of the bones, and then flesh it all out with all the content that will need to be in the game," he wrote. "Yes, it's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."</p>
<p>The release of Haunted Chocolatier is still quite a way away, then, but Barone won't be doing any early access, crowdfunding, or pre-orders ahead of its full launch.</p>
<p>"I will not release a game unless it is complete and I am very happy with it, and I think that's what most people would want, anyway," he surmised, though he will still be releasing development updates on occasion.</p>
<p>Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">first revealed Haunted Chocolatier in October 2021</a>, with Stardew Valley fans eager to find out more on his next project.</p>
<p>While similar to Stardew Valley in aesthetic, the game will see players running a haunted chocolate shop, along with monster hunting and life sim elements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/project-mugen-is-now-ananta-see-the-new-trailer-for-the-anime-urban-open-world-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ananta has been revealed as the new name for Project Mugen by Naked Rain and NetEase, their upcoming ‘urban open world’ game that looks to take on the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> with a wild mishmash of gaming inspirations and ideas.</p>
<p>Ananta is in development for PC, mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>. Pre-registration is now available with the first tests coming in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="ANANTA | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KeN9CeJQi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s see, I can spot plenty of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 announce trailer</a> through the first half of the video, but it quickly becomes clear that this isn’t just an anime GTA-like when someone breathes an ice cream into existence, and a chainsaw car monster goes rampaging down a motorway. Also the bipedal toilet race…</p>
<p>Later in the trailer we get glimpses of gameplay inspired by Insomniac’s Spider-Man games, with grapple swinging through the city and stealthy superhero game action with environmental takedowns. That’s alongside the more standard action RPG combat with some over the top cutscene abilities. But there’s also plenty more of the open world GTA-like stuff with politely asking drivers to get out of their car for you and driving round the city, gun battles in a car chase, more standard car races, shooting hoops, weight lifting, darts, and more.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty wild mash of ideas, at times. So long as you can live with free-to-play gacha monetisation as seen in Genshin and ZZZ, this could be right up your street.</p>
<p>As for what’s actually going on in the world? Here’s some blurb from <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">Naked Rain</a>:</p>
<p>Welcome to Nova, the sun-soaked coastal hub that’s perfect for ditching winter!</p>
<p>This city is electric—whether you’re street surfing in Paradox Plaza or pulling marathon gaming sessions at Glimmergold, there’s never a dull moment. And with humans and Chaos living side by side, you never know what crazy twists your adventure might take!</p>
<p>Nova Tourism Board Pro Tip: Run into Chaos gone wild? Report it first, snap selfies later! Have a blast, but stay safe!</p>

            <p>Friday The 13th: The Game and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> developers Illfonic have announced that they've laid off an unspecified number of staff as they "re-align" to "a refined strategy". No reasons for the layoffs are given in the statement, beyond a cursory gesture towards "the state of the industry".</p><!--more-->
<p>"Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic," writes CEO and co-founder Charles Brunghardt <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/illfonic_an-update-from-illfonic-activity-7270138603437989888-6BkN/">on LinkedIn</a>. "It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy. There is a lot of talent in this group and if you or your team is hiring, please reach out so people can be connected to open roles."</p>
<p>The announcement doesn't confirm which teams have been affected, but Illfonic have offices in Colorado, Washington and Texas, USA. The company employed 78 people as of 2019, though this was before the founding of the Texas office.</p>
<p>As Matt Wales <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-studio-illfonic-lays-off-staff-as-it-realigns-to-a-refined-strategy">comments</a> over at Eurogamer, it's possible the layoffs have something to do with the expiration of the license rights for Friday the 13th, which obliged IllFonic and publisher Gun Media to pull the video game adaptation from sale last December. The studio's subsequent asymmetrical horror games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a> and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game don't seem to have found a following, going by the latest Steam activity charts.</p><p>IllFonic had high hopes for Killer Klowns, despite the relative obscurity of the license, viewing it as more of an everyperson game than Friday The 13th. "We've found that asymmetrical horror games aren't always for the hardcore gamer, so we've really tried to balance this out to make it fun and interactive for any type of playstyle," CCO Jared Gerritzen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-multiplayer-horror-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-does-away-with-downtime">told Nic in May</a>. "We've found with [our previous games], fans that don't play videogames but love the IP will come in. With Klowns, this is that opportunity to bring that 'evade and escape' vs having that hardcore shooter mentality. I think we've got a really good balance."</p>
<p>I don't know the ratio of new hires to layoffs in 2024, but it's certainly been a "harsh" year for job losses. According to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">unofficial tracker</a>, around 14,000 people have lost their jobs this year, up from 10,500 in 2023. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">said goodbye to roughly 277 people in the course of "sunsetting" XDefiant</a>, their live service shooter. Brendy has been keeping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">an unofficial list</a> of the dire euphemisms companies use to sweeten the layoff pill in their official statements. For my money, the most baleful is surely Take-Two's "rationalizing" away the livelihoods of hundreds of staff. But "refining" your workforce is pretty obnoxious too, with its suggestion of purging the impurities during the smelting process.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all IllFonic devs who are now looking for work.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/</link>

			<p>It's been a while since Arkane has shelved the Dishonored IP. Granted, that part of the story was successfully concluded with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death of the Outsider</a> in 2017, but there are so many parts of that unique steampunk/dieselpunk world that would deserve to have their own games. Sure, it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-and-dishonored-are-set-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Deathloop takes place in the same setting (albeit in the far future), but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>A proper Dishonored 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> alongside other unannounced Bethesda games (The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3 remasters, a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel) during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial in 2023, but none of those projects ever materialized, suggesting they were set aside after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax.</p>
<p>While the actual franchise may be lying dormant and there's no telling when it might return with Arkane Austin <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead</a> and Arkane Lyon busy with Marvel's Blade, Arkane founder and series creator Raphaël Colantonio promised fans they will enjoy the next project in development at WolfEye Studios, which will marry the likes of Dishonored and Prey with an additional RPG layer. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-raphael-colantonios-next-game-is-and-isnt-like-dishonored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>People who loved Dishonored and Prey are going to feel very at home. It's uncompromised… We are just going full on into that kind of game in the way we create worlds, the way we let choices to the player. And I think there are going to be even more choices this time because of the RPG layer. We'll have a lot of different ways to do things.</em></p>
<p>The game will be played in first-person like Dishonored. Colantonio also confirmed it will feature shooter-like gameplay.</p>
<p><em>There is something about real-time decision making, as opposed to everything being stats, that makes us feel more in the moment, more immersed. I'm surprised the intersection between RPG and first-person shooter has not been more of a thing.</em></p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, except that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/weird-west-developer-gets-investment-for-its-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more ambitious</a> than the studio's debut (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>) thanks to a generous investment received by WolfEye early on. We do know it is set in a steampunk world and a Limited Alpha will take place next year, with sign-ups open <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review.1052343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Holidays are supposed to be relaxing, but that definitely hasn’t been the case for Alex, the protagonist of Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. Between being caught in a storm, shipwrecked and washed up on a mysterious island, she’s also found herself in the company of some distinctly idiosyncratic people. Not only are they named after the Grecian gods, they’re all suffering from an unhelpful bout of amnesia, which, for someone who just wants to go home, is downright infuriating.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01kdNoJKfgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still, Alex has the kind of can-do attitude that many game protagonists have, and instead of sitting about in the doldrums, she sets about exploring the island, discovering what makes the inhabitants tick, and hopefully figuring out a way to get herself back home.</p>


<p>The interesting thing is, the inhabitants of Ambrosia Island actually are the Greek gods of myth, they’re just not quite as you’d remember them. Polygon Treehouse present to us their take on the gods, which is to say, they’ve been modernised and reimagined, opening up questions about the nature of godhood, of the passage of time, and of character through the lens of modernity. That sounds overtly serious, and Mythwrecked isn’t a ‘serious’ game, but it is one with charm, gentleness and compassion – a perfect antidote to this season’s crop of calamitous blockbusters.</p>


<p>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island is the epitome of a chilled, cosy experience, and it’s easy to fall into the routine of searching the island, discovering new residents and helping them with their missing memories. Unlocking a memory has to be one of the game’s highlights, combining some joyous animation with further information and introspection from that character. Your first companion is Hermes, the messenger of the gods, but he’s lost his sandals and his satchel, relying on you to return them to him.</p>
<p>This is where you get to utilise the height of Grecian technology: the Ambrosidex. While there’s no Pokémon here, you are attempting to catch all the gods’ memories, and there’s a map, an inventory, and further lore for you to dig into within your device. Crammed in alongside, it also functions as a radar, bleeping away when you’re coming closer to a god’s lost items. With Alex’s quest to get home, and her commitment to helping the island’s residents, it is basically essential and helps to keep everything organised while you explore.</p>
<p>Hermes isn’t just good for spilling a few memories out of his winged mouth, he also helps you to fast travel around the island via Portal Doors, which you can unlock by swapping Ambrosia fruit for the corresponding key. Given that you’ll be collecting these fruit without even thinking, it’s a fair trade. He’s not the only one who’s after some fruit though, so you might want to balance out who you’re giving them to, at least to begin with.</p>
<p>Every one of the gods here is suffering from amnesia, and to build their trust in you, they each set you a task. These tasks in turn bring life back to the island, resurrecting the landscape and returning it to its former glory, while strengthening the corresponding god, and your relationship with them. Gods are always after offerings, and it just so happens that Alex is a kind and helpful soul who’s willing to do the legwork for them.</p>

<p>You soon settle into the rhythm of discovery and exploration, and though there are few actual puzzles, the island itself is one huge conundrum. There are myriad interlocking parts that you have to put together in a certain order to progress, and it’s a gentle gameplay loop that easily whisks away the hours.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that Ambrosia Island isn’t without its mild frustrations. Just like a real-life visit to a foreign place, you often have little idea where you’re going, and you’ll meander back and forth across the increasingly expansive island in search of various landmarks that you just know you’ve seen fifteen minutes before.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a map, and hopping in and out of it will point you in the right direction, though it won’t provide you with all the answers as to how to get there, and where precisely the thing is you’re looking for.</p>
<p>The soundtrack reflects the laid-back vibes, with your exploration set to plaintive acoustic guitar and the constant sound of waves crashing against the beach. There’s much more to experience here as well, with unlockable cassettes lying around the place, each with their own ditties, and there’s a ridiculous number of opportunities to sit and listen wherever there’s a tape deck and some comfortable cushions. In many ways, this is the heart of Mythwrecked, ensuring that you take your time, ease into it, and consider exactly why you’re here.</p>
<p>While Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island runs smoothly throughout, the audio levels are occasionally off-kilter – seriously, these are some <em>LOUD</em> sound effects, and the transitions between different areas can result in a less than enjoyable audio hiccup. There’s the option to turn different elements of the audio down though, which solves many of the issues, and hopefully these rough edges can be rounded off with a patch or two.</p>

<p>The Holiday season is all about giving, and gamers absolutely love gifts themed around their favorite franchises. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> had one of its most successful launches ever with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, as millions have been enjoying the title ever since its launch on October 25.</p>



<p>As with every Christmas, plenty more players will join the pool after being gifted the game, but if they already have it, what sort of presents would a Call of Duty fan love?</p>



<p>Here’s our Holiday Gift Guide for a Call of Duty fan, so you know exactly what to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $70 / £70</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 full game</a></li>
</ul>



<p>While it may seem obvious, the best gift you can get a Call of Duty fan this Christmas is the new title, Black Ops 6. While most will likely already have the game, this should certainly be the first consideration when gifting a CoD fan. </p>



<p>If you know what platform they play on, great, and if you know whether they’d prefer a digital or physical copy, even better. If they usually get games digitally, and especially if they have a PlayStation Digital Edition or Xbox Series S, you’ll want to gift them with a voucher for the platform so they can purchase it with ease.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that the price will vary depending on what edition you purchase, as you may find it cheaper at certain outlets. There are always some great deals around Christmas too, so keep an eye on Black Ops 6 as you may be able to get it on sale.</p>

<h2 id="h-steelseries-headset">SteelSeries Headset</h2>

<li><strong>Price: </strong>Wide range</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://steelseries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteelSeries website</a></li>
</ul>



<p>An amazing gift for any gamer is a SteelSeries Headset, and that’s even more so for a Call of Duty player since it’s an extremely competitive game. Having top-notch audio is essential for detecting footsteps and other audio cues, and SteelSeries are widely regarded as the best.</p>



<p>As an owner of a SteelSeries Headset myself, I can vouch for the quality. No matter what range you go for you’re guaranteed comfort and high-quality audio, but if you have a bigger budget I’d recommend the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, which is compatible with all platforms. </p>



<p>You should find some great deals on SteelSeries Headsets around the Holiday period too, so keep an eye out on places like Amazon and the official SteelSeries website.</p>

<h2 id="h-dualsense-edge-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">DualSense Edge / Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>
<ul>
<li>DualSense Edge – $199.99 / £189.99</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>If the person you’re gifting for doesn’t have the premium controller offering for their platform of choice, the DualSense Edge for PlayStation and Elite Wireless Controller for Xbox are both excellent options if you have a high budget. Even if they’re on PC, these controllers can be hooked up to their rig and used, so it’s a great option for all platforms. </p>



<p>Call of Duty is all about having smooth aim and movement, and the controller is the main instrument for that. So, having a premium controller with extra buttons and customization options can increase performance and that’s something a CoD addict will value greatly.</p>

<h2 id="h-kontrolfreeks">KontrolFreeks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $/£10-20</li>

</ul>



<p>KontrolFreeks are thumb grips that you attach to your controller’s thumbsticks for better accuracy and control. It provides extra height for the thumbsticks, which makes it easier to make more precise movements by increasing the arc distance. They have been proven to help accuracy and grip, something that’s ever-important in a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent accessory for any Call of Duty player, and they’re very popular. You can purchase Call of Duty-themed KontrolFreeks, making it the perfect gift for players grinding Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>

</ul>



<p>If they’re a fan of Call of Duty, they’re most likely a fan of the Zombies mode too. For Black Ops 6, Call of Duty have produced a Zombies key art Poster, featuring the full crew – Weaver, Carver, Auguinaldo, and Grey. </p>



<p>These characters are the latest Zombies crew, and since BO6 has brought back the classic round-based format, they’ll no doubt become iconic. If the first few maps are anything to go by, Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode will be a favorite that Call of Duty fans will look back on, and the poster’s vibrant colors make it the perfect addition to any gaming setup.</p>

</ul>



<p>Another great stocking filler for any Call of Duty fan is this Black Ops 6 magnet.

<p>The magnet features the iconic Black Ops sitting bull pose and if you’re wondering about its size and material, it’s an acrylic 3.5 x 5.5 in magnet.</p>

<p>Lastly, another small gift perfect for a Call of Duty fan’s stocking is this Metallic Logo Decal. Just like in-game, where players can customize their favorite weapons with colorful decals, this allows fans to customize a belonging of theirs with the iconic Call of Duty logo. </p>



<p>This vinyl sticker is acceptable for both indoor and outdoor applications, whether they choose to stick it on their console or car. It’s fairly large too, so it will stand out wherever they decide to use it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/my-first-gran-turismo-gt7-free-trial-is-out-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital have revealed that My First Gran Turismo, the free trial for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Turismo 7</a>, will go live on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 tomorrow. Game creator and legendary designer Kazunori Yamauchi explained the purpose of My First Gran Turismo in a post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p><em>My First Gran Turismo is a special free-to-play invitation to dive into the exhilarating world of motorsports. This experience holds a special place in my heart, as it pays tribute to the origins of the first Gran Turismo, where players of all generations discovered the joys of driving. Whether it’s introducing kids to the joy of racing for the first time or reigniting a forgotten passion for driving, My First Gran Turismo was designed to be both approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level.</em></p>
<p><em>This isn’t just about playing a game; it’s about embarking on a personal driving journey. We’ve made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges that’ll steadily refine their driving skills.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXOQLqjBWb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The My First Gran Turismo trial will feature three Race Events, three Time Trials, three Music Rally stages, a full suite of License Tests, eighteen unique cars, and these three tracks: Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit. Owners of PS VR2 can also look forward to checking out the trial in virtual reality mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's still no news about a PC version. Two years ago, Yamauchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a statement that ignited the hopes of PC gamers; however, he quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-pc-isnt-actually-in-development-confirms-yamauchi-series-has-sold-90-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recanted</a>, clarifying that while they were open to the possibility, nothing was being worked on at the time.</p>
<p>It's strange because Sony is slowly but surely porting all of its exclusives to PC. At this point, Gran Turismo 7 might be the biggest missing one, and it's all the weirder because adding such a big platform could definitely help fill out the online races.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-mandalorian-adventures-review-is-this-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever wanted to run and gun your way across the <em>Star Wars</em> universe? Did you watch the adventures of Mando and Grogu during the Mandalorian TV show and think, that's some of me right there? Well, the board game <em>Star Wars&nbsp;the Mandalorian Adventures</em> takes you right into the first season of the stellar TV show, featuring art, characters, and scenarios from it. In this review, we'll have a look at how it plays, who you can play, and will try to keep it as spolier free as possible.</p>

<p>We've covered a whole host of <em>Star Wars</em>-themed games on the site, from the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Unlnimted</a> to the miniature wargames <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow">X-Wing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-core-set-review-pick-dark-or-light-and-go-to-war" rel="nofollow">Legion</a>, and also <em>Star Wars</em> video games like the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-2.jpg?itok=Ep5aY8o_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-2.jpg?itok=AoTktyCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> take place on a scenario map in pages of the game book.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars</em> <em>the Mandalorian Adventures</em> features an incredibly easy core set of mechanics, and also one of the best onboarding systems I've seen. The game takes place using a book as the playmat, a system we've seen used to great success in other tabletop games. The map pages also feature the rules for that scenario, keeping everything handily in front of you. As you progress through the game's scenarios, you'll add components until you've unlocked the whole game. This system adds in elements as you play, none of which are particularly complicated, but this feels aimed at non-gamers, rather than veteran tabletop players. I felt like I could have gone all in during the first scenario, but adding elements as you go does have a nice flow to it.</p>

<p>During the game, players take turns, acting cooperatively to complete the mission. Games can be played solo, with a player controlling more characters if that's your preferred style of play. Each character has a deck of 12 cards, and each card has a power, between 1 and 4. All characters start with 3 of each power, and you randomly draw 4 of those cards into your hand. Each turn you get to take 2 actions, which you do by placing a card in the action slot on the board. There are 4 types of action:</p>

<ul><li>Move - Which lets your character move around the map</li>
	<li>Attack - Which lets you try to take out the enemies on the map</li>
	<li>Intel - Which lets you view unknown threats, or move threats</li>
	<li>Plan - Which lets you draw cards from the planning deck that might help you later on</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-3.jpg?itok=Uhn_WVG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-3.jpg?itok=vk7mR8gJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After every game of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures,</em> you unlock new rules and cards from the Guide deck.</figcaption></figure><p>The power of the card you place in the action slot is how effective that action is. You can move further, attack harder, view threats further away, and draw more cards to find a good one. You can also only do each action once per turn, which adds a great tactical element to which 2 actions you pick, and which cards you place. If you can't quite reach to attack an enemy this turn, do you save your high power card for the attack, or use it to move this turn and attack with a lower powered card?</p>

<p>Once you've had your turn, the cards stay on the board, and after any player's turn, if the combined score of any cards in a slot is 5 or more, then an event happens, if the combined total is 6, then a crisis and then an event happens. This adds another great dynamic to the game as events/crises can never be avoided in total, but they can be worked around until you're in a better position to deal with them. It noticeability adds a risk element early game, as everyone wants to move, but if everyone does, you'll quickly have an event, so working out between you who should move and who should plan and intel the threats can work in your favor until you're ready to activate an event.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-4.jpg?itok=BIlCh7ZN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-4.jpg?itok=j5WJn-Y_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures</em> includes 8 playable characters from the first season of the TV show.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Can You Play In Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> has 8 playable characters, each with their own themed action deck. The characters you can play are:</p>

<ul><li>The Mandalorian</li>
	<li>IG-11</li>
	<li>Paz Vizsla</li>
	<li>Burg</li>
	<li>Migs Mayfield</li>
	<li>Xi'an</li>
	<li>Cara Dune</li>
	<li>Greef Karga</li>
</ul><p>Even though the power spread across all the decks are the same, each character also has bonus actions on their cards, which can be used if played for that specific action type. For example, Mando has the Beskar Armor Plan card, which instead of planning, if played in the plan spot, he can search the plan deck for a defend card, and Paz has the Heavy Blaster Cannon attack action, which instead of attacking, can be used to deal 2 damage to up to 3 different threats at 1 range.</p>

<p>Each of the characters feels unique, which I was extremely pleased to see. Getting theme into board games is challenging, and <em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> manages to do it well, capturing each character uniquely and making the play experience with each, and with different combinations rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-5.jpg?itok=742xQ-Ut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-5.jpg?itok=Tmwwze1d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In each of the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> decks, each character has a few unique power cards with thematic abilities.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Many Missions Does Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures Have?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> has 4 scenarios to play through in the map book, and each should be played in order as you work through the guide deck. Once you've played through and unlocked all the content, all of the scenarios can be played through again with different missions, and with different characters. I was actually surprised at the replayability of the game. It initially looked like it would be a quick and unrewarding experience, but there's a lot of replayability out of the box. It does also say that these are missions inspired by Season 1 of the TV show, so we might see another 2 games/expansions (and a bonus one for the Book of Boba Fett?).</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p>I was very surprised by <em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em>. I'm a huge fan of the TV show, but at first, on reading through the rules, and seeing that it only had 4 scenarios, it looked very basic. But it actually has a lot of depth behind the simple mechanics. It's not hyper-tactical, but is it fun, and the onboarding is extremely well done. It would be very easy to get a non-gamer <em>Star Wars</em> fan to play this and enjoy it, without having to spend ages explaining the rules, or having to manage them while they play through the first game</p>



<p>If you're a Mandalorian or <em>Star Wars</em> fan, then you will almost certainly enjoy this. It's a great experience, with a lot more depth than I initially thought. If you're not a <em>Star Wars </em>fan, then this might lose a lot of its drive. The mechanics are solid, but there are other adventure-style games out there that you might enjoy more. If you've never seen <em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;or the Mandalorian, then I would recommend watching the TV show first, as there are some spoilers in here about the characters and different situations.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch doesn't have an officially licensed guitar controller for Fortnite Festival, but it is getting a spiritual successor to a controller that was once bundled with Guitar Hero: On Tour for.... Nintendo DS. Yes, controller manufacturer CRKD is releasing a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNKGYHP4?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Festival Edition</a> of its impressive Neo S Controller with a 5-fret attachment.

Playing Guitar Hero with cartridge slot attachment was actually pretty fun, so the Fortnite Festival Edition Neo S for Switch and PC sounds cool.

CRKD's Neo S is a pro-style controller in a compact form factor. It has Hall Effect analog sticks, which combat pesky stick drift, and has swappable thumbstick caps. Additional stick tops are sold separately in bundles of eight. Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Stick-Tops-Nitro-Deck/dp/B0CMV7N9XH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 stick top bundles in gray,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Stick-Tops-Nitro-Midnight/dp/B0CMV7PCDS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a>, and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Stick-Tops-Nitro-Retro/dp/B0CMV8D8VP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">orange and black combo pack</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Neo S also also has Hall Effect triggers with customizable sensitivity via the CRKD mobile app. The easy-to-use app is where you go to map inputs, including the pair of remappable back buttons. The Neo S has adjustable rumble and motion controls, though motion controls will only work on Nintendo Switch. Within the app, you can turn on optional preloaded configurations, including a turbo mode.</p><hr><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Other CRKD Neo S models</h2><p dir="ltr"><b>$50</b></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408925-neo-s-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408925" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408925-neo-s-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408925"></a><figcaption>CKRD Neo S controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408925-neo-s-controller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">CRKD's Neo S first released in April. Like the manufacturer's Nitro Deck handheld controller (more on that below), the Neo S aims to be a useful controller <em>and </em>a collectible.

        <p><strong>Vice</strong> (voiced by Mayumi Saco)</p><p>Like Mature, Vice was once one of the Hakkesshu—loyal followers who sought to revive the dreaded Orochi.

            <p>
With the season of giving now officially upon us, Jingle Jam has unveiled its latest PC charity bundle - this year featuring the stellar likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, Shadows of Doubt, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, which can all be snapped up in support of a bunch of good causes.
</p>
<p>
In total, the Jingle Jam 2024 Games Collection feature 18 titles (all supplied as Steam codes), and there's a lot of good stuff to be found. For the most part we're in the realm of indies, although Sega and Two Point Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">enormously enjoyable Two Point Campus</a> sneaks in too.
</p>
<p>
Also up for grabs are ColePowered Games' wildly ambitious procedurally generated detective noir Shadows of Doubt (which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-doubt-review-an-unmatched-detective-similation-when-it-works">gave three stars</a> back in October), superb sci-fi narrative adventure Citizen Sleeper (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">Recommended</a>), survival city builder Frostpunk (also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-review-a-thrilling-but-thin-frozen-city-building-game">Recommended</a>), and minimalist puzzler Patrick's Parabox (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patricks-parabox-review-a-simple-minimalist-puzzler-with-recursive-depths">four stars</a>!).

<p>
But there's more: roguelike card battler Widlfrost is in there (this one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-personal-top-five-games-of-2023">made Bertie's Games of 2023 list</a>), as is wonderfully engaging sci-fi construction sim Mars First Logistics, sticker store management game Sticky Business, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-crabs-treasure-feels-a-natural-evolution-for-an-underwater-soulslike">crustacean-themed Souls-like Another Crab's Treasure</a>, and the sequel to acclaimed 2018 tabletop-style RPG adventure, For the King 2.
</p><p>
Also included is the well-received blackjack roguelike adventure Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scorn-review-beautifully-grotesque-puzzle-horror-that-doesnt-quite-congeal">Geiger-esque horror Scorn</a>, action-tower defense game Orcs Must Die 3, dystopian racer Death Sprint 66, dating sim action-RPG Eternights, card-battling rogue-like Hadean Tactics, hand-drawn puzzle adventure Submachine: Legacy, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fights-in-tight-spaces-review-a-strategical-secret-agent-beat-em-up-thats-almost-there">Fight in Tight Spaces</a> - a "stylish blend of deck-building, turn-based tactics, and thrilling animated fight sequences in classic action-movie settings". And if you prefer you lists in bullet point form:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</li>
<li>Wildfrost</li>
<li>Two Point Camps</li>
<li>Shadows of Doubt</li>

<li>Death Sprint 66</li>

<li>Frostpunk</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Jingle Jam 2024 Games Collection is a bit of corker, then, and if you're sufficiently swayed, all the above can be acquired for a very reasonable donation of £35. Or rather, for a minimum donation of £35 - with more appreciated if you're able, seeing as organisers are hoping to raise as much money as possible for this year's eight selected charities.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, money accrued though Jingle Jam 2024's charity bundle will go to Autistica, Campaign Against Living Miserably, Cool Earth, Sarcoma UK, The Trevor Project, Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Appeal, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, and War Child. You can read more about each charity - and purchase this year's games bundle - over on the <a href="https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/">Jingle Jam website</a>. At the time of writing, it's successfully raised £1,277,979.

However, as you get stuck into the game's dice-rolling collectathon grind, you'll likely start wondering if there are any redeemable codes to give you a leg up in building your aura arsenal. We've put together this page to give you all the details on the game's status regarding redeemable codes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/03/roblox-sols-rng-header-1733263408082.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Are There Any Active Sol's RNG Codes?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there are currently <strong>no codes for Sol's RNG</strong>. There's no word on whether redeemable codes are a feature the team behind the game intends to eventually add, but if and when they are added, we'll update this page with all the details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Check For Sol's RNG Codes?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to check for updates on whether codes have been added to Sol's RNG, your best bet is to join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/solsrng" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game's official Discord server</a>. As we mentioned earlier, there are currently no codes or even a method to input them, but if that changes, the developers are likely to make an official announcement in the server's <strong>announcements channel</strong>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Sol's RNG in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sol's RNG is one of the most popular RNG games currently on Roblox. After dropping in, you're able to roll a dice, with each roll adding new auras to your collection. Your goal is to collect as many rare auras as possible, with players able to equip their acquired auras to see their character transform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

Activision has announced it'll be giving those few remaining Call of Duty fans who haven't already bought this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> or played it through Game Pass the chance to get stuck in for free next week, as part of a seven-day trial.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Free Trial starts next Friday, 13th December, on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It'll continue into the following week, wrapping up on Friday, 20th December.
</p>
<p>
Going by the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1863976795113918904">infographic shared as part of Activision's announcement</a>, participating players can get stuck into Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, Kill Confirmed, Kill Order, and Prop Hunt modes as part of the the Free Trial - with Black Ops 6's Racket, Hacienda, Extraction, Hideout, Heirloom, and Nuketown Holiday maps all included.

<p>
There's good news for anyone craving some undead slaughter too; Black Ops 6's Free Trial is set to offer a taste of Zombies mode, with Standard and Directed versions of Liberty Falls and Terminus all present according to that infographic. What's not clear, however, is if XP progress will be carried over to the full game, should players be sufficiently enthralled to make a purchase - but hopefully Activision will share more details before next Friday comes around.

Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was, admittedly, lukewarm on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">reviewed it in October</a>. "I had an alright time, and then left it much earlier than expected," he wrote, "with few real reasons to come back". Hence his three star score.
</p><p>
Still, Microsoft seemed pleased with the commercial response to the Black Ops 6's launch. The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">called its arrival</a> the "biggest Call of Duty release ever", saying it had set a record for "Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Can you believe <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> only came out three months ago? For all the anguish, criticism and hand-wringing it inspired it feels more like 17 years. </p><p>Surveying this discourse, you'd be forgiven for thinking (if you hadn't played it yourself) that this was one of the worst games of the year! Such is the nature of video game discussion today, fuelled by the decline of the website, the rise of the thumbnail reaction face and the obliteration of traditional social media channels. This game cost money, came from a big publisher and had an even bigger license attached to it. It was set in a universe with a toxic waste dump for a fandom, while starring a woman in the lead role. There's no room for nuance when the stakes are that high. No room to explore what the game is and what it’s trying to do. The Emperor's thumb, as driven by algorithms as it is, can only point up or down.</p><figure></figure><p>I didn't play <em>Outlaws</em> in August for two reasons: One, I couldn't afford to buy it at the time. And two, I'd been cursed by that discourse. When<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a big review scores the game 2/5 and makes very convincing arguments</a>, I'm affected. When normal people make seemingly valid complaints about Ubisoft's tired open world formula,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-mirage-was-juuusssttt-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as someone bored with some recent <em>Assassin's Creed </em>games, that hit home</a>. And as someone who has all but fallen out of love with <em>Star Wars</em> following Disney's decade and change of neglect, even the license held little appeal.</p><p>But I played it across November and December, after a number of patches and updates to the game have done everything from solve some technical issues to making stealth sections easier. And let me tell you: I think it's fuckin' great.</p><p>I'm not here to diminish people's very understandable concerns with so much of this game's design. A lot of the negative reviews were right, from a certain point of view: <em>Outlaws </em>has problems. Whole sections are broken or pointless (the criminal influence system especially), there are dumb restrictions on stuff like weapon use (you only carry one gun permanently), space combat is underbaked, the speeder is a nightmare to control, I could go on forever. And would, if others hadn't done so already.</p><p>I am here, though, to point out that a lot of those issues (though not all!) were clearly caused by a major publisher, desperate for an injection of cash, rushing a licensed AAA game onto the market before it was ready. And that the three months since launch have seen the game markedly improved. It's still weird that you can pick up other people's guns only sometimes, but at least now you don't drop them every time you climb a ladder. It's still annoying that you can't hide bodies you knock out silently during stealth sections, but now if you're discovered there are no more instafails, so you can at least blast your way out.</p><p>Basically, whatever game it was that people played and reviewed and posted and talked about in August, that game was from August. The one you'll be playing in December is slightly different and, if any of the affected stuff matters to you, better.</p><figure></figure><p>A lot of the criticism of <em>Outlaws </em>upon release seemed based on what it wasn't--it wasn't as sneaky as <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, wasn't as blasty as <em>The Division</em>, etc--so let's spend a little time talking about what it <em>is</em>. It's a game where you play as Kay Vess, a young criminal making her way through the galaxy on her first big score. Well, second...the first got a bounty put on her head, so you're also making your way through the galaxy trying to clear that. You've got your own ship, your own crew, you have a little rodent sidekick. You visit a number of <em>Star Wars</em> planets--some of them with large open worlds to explore--and there's a combination of main storyline quests, contracts and card games to keep you busy.</p><p>Sometimes you get to ride a skittish speederbike, which can be frustrating (you crash a lot!) or amazing (sunsets over Tatooine!). Other times you fly a spaceship and shoot at TIE Fighters in a way that feels like a mobile port of <em>Star Wars Squadrons</em>. And sometimes you get to play cards. The first two are lowpoints. The latter is, depending on how much you enjoy games-within-games, one of the finest examples of the genre.</p><p>You spend the vast majority of your time in <em>Outlaws </em>just walking around. A lot. Exploring towns, talking to people; you do a bunch of missions, most of which involve sneaking around somewhere (hence the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> comparisons), and some of which are closer to something like <em>Tomb Raider</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>, where you just explore a wreck/ruin and do some basic platforming.</p><p>That sneaking has been one of the discourse's main bones of contention, because for such a cornerstone of the experience, it's not great. Combat isn't much better; aside from a neat trick where you can use different types of blast for different enemies, it's plagued by poor AI and a disastrously poor cover system (in that there kinda isn't one).</p><p>It's not an unplayable <em>disaster</em>; you can have fun on these missions. There are some problems to solve and some bank vaults to rob, and it never gets old sneaking up on space fascists and punching them in the face. I'm also going to take this opportunity to express my love for Nix, your little space cat sidekick who is there primarily as a quality-of-life tool, able to fetch distant items and distract enemies with the push of a button. This game would not have been what it is without him.</p><p>If the missions are just fine, and other parts are not great, and some other parts are even <em>terrible</em>, then isn't <em>Outlaws</em>--despite the updates and patches and supposed improvements--still the same thing everyone was shitting on earlier in the year? How can a stealth game with busted stealth and a shooting game with no cover and an open world game with an uncontrollable speeder bike be "fuckin’ great"?</p><p>Because I don't care about any of that. This is not <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. It's not <em>Uncharted</em>, it's not <em>Tomb Raider,</em> it's not <em>Gears of War</em>. It's not <em>Pod Racer</em>, it's not <em>Squadrons</em>, it's not anything else it's been compared to and found wanting against. This is <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and it doesn't exist to challenge your expectations of the stealth genre, nor to redefine the open world experience for the 21st century. It's a <em>Star Wars </em>game that wants to be maybe the most <em>Star Wars</em> game ever made, and I think it comes pretty close.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Outlaws </em>is, before anything else, an adaptation. That's what Ubisoft spent the money on. The company already has multiple open world AAA franchises, it didn't pay Disney to compete with itself. It paid for <em>Star Wars</em>, for Darth Vader and Rodians and Stormtroopers, and that's what <em>Outlaws </em>does best. It's a game that shines when you're doing some of the (quite literally) most pedestrian acts like walking around, talking to people and soaking up the sights. And it knows this; the game is full of locations and moments where you're specifically prompted to press a button that just leans you on a railing, or sits you down at a cafe, and lets you watch the world--full of very <em>Star Wars</em> characters chatting and going about their lives--pass you by.</p><p>It does this so well that even its dalliances into cliche end up being highlights. You will once again visit Tatooine during this game, but it's not the tiresome recap you might have expected, yet another superficial representation of George Lucas' late-90s reinvention of the place. <em>Outlaws </em>has such a love for the universe's traditions, and such a meticulous eye for detail, that this Tatooine feels more like Ralph McQuarrie's version of the planet: a desolate frontier place, a spaghetti Western with laser guns. It was a pleasure to explore every inch of its Mos Eisley and poke my head into corners only previously glimpsed.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking down the stairs into<em> New Hope's</em> famous cantina was a distinct highlight. That cantina is part of my memories of what used to be my favourite movie; the power of walking into a perfect recreation of it set in an open world video game can't be understated. This is the burden, but also the power, of a thoughtful adaptation. People loved the wizard game despite its flaws, and <em>Alien Isolation</em> is still spoken of in hushed tones over a decade later. <em>Outlaws </em>is in the same category, its love for the source material (specifically, the late-70s source of the source material) shining through everywhere from costume design to sound effects.</p><p>It's not <em>Outlaws</em>' fault that it arrived at a time when public conversations about <em>Star Wars</em> has become a minefield,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> for reasons both easy and difficult to explain</a>. This game doesn't care about Skywalkers, or cancelled movies, or terrible TV shows, or online <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture wars</a>, or pretty much anything that has contributed to the dire state of things in 2024. All it wanted to do was bring the original trilogy's vibe to life in a lavish, immersive video game space. For all its other missteps, it absolutely nails that.</p><p>There's so much irony in the fact so many chuds, so many middle-aged lifelong <em>Star Wars</em> fans, were so hostile to this game, because <em>Outlaws </em>is exactly the kind of thing people have wanted from a <em>Star Wars </em>game for so long. <em>Andor </em>is the closest comparison here, an exploration of the universe free from the burden of its lore, that doesn't try to weave itself into an existing story and whose lone encounter with the Force is to treat it as a mind-blowing party trick, not a sacred code. <em>Outlaws </em>is just a game about a single, likeable kid caught up in the events of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, which, like in <em>Andor</em>,<em> </em>looms enormously when the camera is free to zoom out from the Skywalker family and Jedi Council.</p><p>I loved every weird <em>Star Wars</em> guy I met playing <em>Outlaws</em>. I loved every shitty little bar and every sterile Imperial base. I loved riding around Tatooine (when I could go in a long straight line) and flying a spaceship through a debris field (when nobody was shooting at me). I loved the way my little gun sounds just like a <em>Star Wars</em> gun should, and that my spaceship's cockpit looks just like a <em>Star Wars</em> ship's cockpit should.</p><p>I loved all that shit because, in spite of the discourse, in spite of the missteps and crimes committed by Disney over the past decade, I still have love in my heart for <em>Star Wars</em>. Not <em>all </em>of it, of course, but I was born in the 1980s, and that's the <em>Star Wars</em> this game doubles down on. It's a cultural security blanket, an old friend, a cherished photograph on the shelf. The team at Massive (and everyone else who worked on it, it's a big Ubisoft collab) deserve a ton of praise for the lengths the art and sound and writing and design have gone to here to make everything look and feel like it came straight out of the original film trilogy.</p><p>The beauty of a good adaptation--and this is what people miss when they lament the lack of movie tie-in games, not the rushed development and rudimentary gameplay--is that it's something beyond a video game. As a video game, <em>Outlaws </em>had, and still has, issues! The stealth still needs more visual feedback and options, the gunplay is maddening without cover and space combat probably shouldn't have been in the game at all. Some of those frustrations will be addressed in updates; others we're likely stuck with forever.</p><p>As a <em>Star Wars</em> game, though? One that lets you spend 20-30 hours really living inside the universe, warts and all? This is one hell of a game.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyway, Emmrich, the older gentleman of the group is on the very bottom, which isn’t surprising given some cowards would likely view him as “too old” for protagonist Rook.

While Outie Mark (Adam Scott) was under the impression that his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) was dead, Innie Mark knows she’s alive after seeing her photo because Gemma is the silently tortured Ms. Casey, the Wellness Counselor from the Severed building, who appeared in previous episodes. The only problem is, Innie Mark had already begun an office romance with Innie Helly (Britt Lower). Stiller says the second season will unravel the tangled web of this interdimensional love affair.</p><p>“Is Outie Mark going to find out that Innie Mark knows? And how is Outie Mark going to deal with that? At the same time, I think we’ve sort of developed a relationship with Innie Mark and Helly on the inside that feels like it’s going somewhere. So there’s a natural tension that’s growing there between Outie Mark’s interests and Innie Mark’s interests.”</p><p>In the world of <em>Severance, </em>hugs have to pre-approved by higher ups and communicating with yourself (well, your Innie sending messages to your Outie) can be met with strict punishments. So, an Innie uncovering a insidious connection between the outside and inside worlds will undoubtedly have some unsavory consequences in a season where series creator Dan Erickson says “things get darker.” The Innies gained enlightenment of their existence. But, at what cost?</p><p>“The information that has come out into the world that Mark’s wife is alive—if that is actually something that people believe and follow up on, it would have ramifications, obviously, for Lumon going forward,” Stiller explains. “And if Lumon somehow gets exposed, what would happen to the lives of all these Innies who, basically, only exist in Lumon?”</p><p>Stiller will probably propose more questions for us to consider on his and Scott’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-podcast-ben-stiller-adam-scott-1851710455?_gl=1*12ckg9k*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzMzNDQ1Ny44Ni4xLjE3MzMzNDc3NTcuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-podcast-ben-stiller-adam-scott-1851710455?_gl=1*12ckg9k*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzMzNDQ1Ny44Ni4xLjE3MzMzNDc3NTcuMTQuMC4w"><em>Severance</em> podcast</a></span> when it premieres on January 7, ten days before the show itself returns on the 17th. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been anywhere on the internet in the last few months, the chances are you’ll have seen a guy dressed as Miles Morales pretending to be an NPC on stream. He’s one of the few still holding up the gimmick – or at least he was, until now.</p>



<p>The ‘NPC trend’ went wild on sites like TikTok a while back, and ‘NPC Miles Morales’ was by far the most prolific creator to do it. He’d go on stream for hours on end, performing Miles Morales’s (Spider-Man) voice lines and ‘animations’ in exchange for gifts and donations.</p>



<p>He’s announced that he’s giving it up after all these months and pursuing a traditional streaming career.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>



<p>NPC Miles Morales – whose real name is Malik Ambersley – has performed his role since midway through 2023, and over time, he has become increasingly popular and controversial. While streaming, he has been robbed, accosted by police, and gotten into fights, all the while performing a character that he rarely breaks from.</p>



<p>The bit has earned him a substantial amount of money, but to be honest, he has put in the work. What he does is physically demanding and requires a great deal of confidence – and his escapades eventually earned him an iconic spot in Kai Cenat’s recent Mafia 2 subathon.</p>



<p>Now that Ambersley has paired up with Cenat, he has become bigger than ever, and in a recent stream, he revealed that he’s hanging up the Miles Morales costume to pursue traditional activities, such as the ‘IRL streams’ that Kai Cenat is famous for.</p>



<p>He said he’d ‘rather be known for being himself’.</p>



<p>Have you ever caught NPC Miles Morales on stream? Let us know what you think about the character on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Traveller's Tales released Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures in 2008 and followed it up with a sequel in 2010.

The Original Adventures has story beats from the first three Indiana Jones films. The sequel was inspired by The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Both games include over 60 playable characters.</p><p>There's a nice variety of genres represented in this batch of Star Wars games, including two of the most beloved games in franchise history: the 2003 role-playing game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and its 2004 sequel, The Sith Lords. While these games are rough around the edges these days, all fans of BioWare games and Star Wars should give them a shot, as they are still satisfying 30-plus-hour adventures with fun, round-based combat systems and engrossing narratives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4409868-humbleclassicsblackfriday.png" data-ref-id="1300-4409868" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4409868-humbleclassicsblackfriday.png" data-ref-id="1300-4409868"></a><figcaption>Disney Classics: Black Friday Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4409868-humbleclassicsblackfriday.png"></figure><p>Another highlight here is Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, a strategy game that is essentially Age of Empires 2 with Star Wars units and locations. The core gameplay of gathering resources, researching new technologies, and progressing through the ages remains the same, but instead of Scottish or Byzantine civilizations, you get to take control of Trade Federation, Galactic Empire, and Gungan forces. There are several more civilizations here, but if you're looking for classic real-time strategy that explores major conflicts across the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies, this is a fun game.</p><p>For something more action-packed, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is still a blast of fun. Released in the late 2000s, The Force Unleashed told the story of Darth Vader's secret apprentice and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This was a hidden history of Star Wars that had never been explored before--and was rendered non-canon following Disney's purchase of Star Wars in the 2010s--allowing for a cinematic adventure that lived up to its name. This is the Ultimate Sith Edition as well, so in addition to the main campaign, there's some very cool DLC here that pits two of the strongest Force-wielders of their time against each other.</p><p>The other Star Wars games available in this bundle include Jedi Academy--a sequel to Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast--more strategy games in the form of Star Wars: Rebellion and Empire at War, the fun first-person shooter Republic Commando, and two Lego Star Wars games: The Clone Wars and The Complete Saga.</p><p>A few more bundle deals are also available right now from Humble, including a collection of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fscifi-shooters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cool sci-fi shooters</a>, a selection of indie game publisher's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Frawcember-to-remember&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raw Fury's greatest hits</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-telltale-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several story-driven adventures from Telltale Games</a>. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">You can also sign up for Humble Choice this month</a> and grab eight new games, including Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, The Invincible, and several others.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice: December 2024</a> -- 8 games for $12</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fscifi-shooters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sci-Fi Shooters Bundle</a> -- 8 items for $19</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-telltale-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Telltale Collection</a> -- 8 items for $12</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Frawcember-to-remember&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-disney-classics-star-wars-indiana-jones-lego-games%2F1100-6528213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raw Fury: Rawcember to Remember Bundle</a> -- 14 items for $15</li></ul><p>If you still need to preorder a copy of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preorder-guide/1100-6524003/" data-ref-id="1100-6524003">GameSpot's preorder guide</a> for details on the three different editions, preorder bonuses, and more.
