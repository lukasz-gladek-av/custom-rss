			<p>An Alien: Isolation sequel is currently in early development, the original game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of one of the best games inspired by the long-running franchise, Alien: Isolation Creative Director Al Hope shared a new message on <a href="https://x.com/alienisolation/status/1843305291322200488">social media</a>, talking about Creative Assembly's desire to create a new story that would capture the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie while thanking players for their continued support since the game's release back in 2014. At the end of the message, which can be read in full below, Hope confirmed that a sequel is in early development and that more information on this game will be revealed when the team is ready to talk more about it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alien-Isolation-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>Following its original release in 2014, Alien: Isolation was ported first to Nintendo Switch in 2019 and to mobile devices in <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-is-coming-to-mobile-on-december-16/">2021</a>. Despite the technical limitations of the Nintendo console, the port turned out great, giving more players the chance to experience one of the best games based on the franchise ever made, as we highlighted in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alien-isolation-switch-authentic-alien-adventure/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Alien Isolation is an essential horror game, and the Nintendo Switch version might even be the very best place to play it, as long as you can ignore the caveats mentioned above. With excellent picture and audio quality, thick atmosphere, and a beautiful aesthetic, it is one of the most interesting licensed games ever released, and a great stealth horror title to enjoy.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alien-isolation-sequel-announced-to-mark-tenth-anniversary.1002729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alien-isolation-sequel-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and developer Creative Assembly have announced that an<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>sequel is in the works, just as the survival horror game hits its tenth anniversary.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>creative director Al Hope says that witnessing players' "passion" for&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>has been "nothing short of incredible" over the past ten years.</p>
<p>He says he and his team are filled with "deep gratitude" for the way players have appreciated the game over the years, and that <i>Isolation&nbsp;</i>is a "dream project brought to life by a brilliant team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alien-isolation-sequel-android.jpg?itok=7-2Soe6W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alien-isolation-sequel-android.jpg?itok=YYEjO23K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a followup.</figcaption></figure><p>Hope closes his message of thanks by announcing that fans' "distress calls" have been heard, and that an&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>sequel is currently in development at Creative Assembly.</p>
<p>Right now, the project is in its early stages, so it's unlikely we'll hear more about it for a while. Hope says he and his team will share more details with players "when we're ready", so don't expect news imminently.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that a followup to&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is on the way at all should be cause for celebration; it's been a long ten years since the original, and once again getting to hide in lockers in terror of the Xenomorph discovering us is an exciting prospect.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation</em>, it's a survival horror game set aboard a space station called Sevastopol, and it serves as a direct sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>The game follows the story of Amanda Ripley, daughter of iconic space mechanic Ellen, as she attempts to discover the truth behind the disappearance of her mother.</p>
<p>Many&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>games, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/aliens-fireteam-elite"><em>Fireteam Elite</em></a>, focus on action, but&nbsp;<em>Isolation&nbsp;</em>asks you to evade and outrun the Xenomorph, distract it so you can solve puzzles, and generally avoid confronting it if you can help it.</p>
<p>We still don't know much about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>sequel, but we'll bring you more on it as soon as we get it. In the meantime, you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/alien-isolation-review">review of the original</a> from way back in the mists of 2014 to refresh your memory!</p>

Instead of choosing a player class, by equipping two different types of weapons you earn both the active and passive skills of each, letting you create hybrid builds that can be a hell of a lot of fun to experiment with.<br></p><p>The best build is always going to be the one you have the most fun with, of course, and any combination of weapons is <em>viable</em> for clearing content if built and played well. But some combinations are better than others, leading to the inevitable metas—to give you an idea of what’s working best for many players at the moment, here are some of the most commonly used builds known for being top-tier.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-recommend-id="image://46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sword and shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sword and shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-recommend-id="image://46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sword and shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You might imagine sword plus sword is a bit of a redundant pick, but by combining the Sword &amp; Shield with the Greatsword, you can become the ultimate ass-kicking tank. This build allows you to not only mitigate damage exceptionally well with various defensive skills, but you also dish out the hurt using the Greatsword’s hard-hitting abilities. With the right setup, this can also be one of the best farming builds, letting you gather tons of enemies and DPS them down rapidly.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> A combination of the Sword &amp; Shield + Wand &amp; Tome turns you into a traditional paladin archetype, granting you substantial sustain via healing spells, while offering up some damage-over-time abilities. If raw survivability is your goal, this build is calling your name.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-recommend-id="image://924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wandy goodness." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wandy goodness." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-recommend-id="image://924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wandy goodness." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s essentially impossible to beat the type of healing you can achieve by using a Wand &amp; Tome with a Staff. You’ll bring some decent damage alongside being able to spam single-target and AOE healing spells to keep your party alive through just about anything. Even better, this combo is also incredible for farming due to a mixture of both weapons’ AOE spells, making it one of the most versatile builds in the game.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> The Wand &amp; Tome with the Longbow turns you into a utility class. Though you may be missing a bit of the synergy found in the Wand &amp; Tome + Staff build, you’ll nevertheless be a useful addition to your party with high damage, passive and active buffs, and off-healing capabilities.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-recommend-id="image://cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eye-demon stares at players." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An eye-demon stares at players." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-recommend-id="image://cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eye-demon stares at players." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If dishing out consistently high damage with an enjoyable rotation is your cup of tea, you won’t want to sleep on the Greatsword and Dagger combo. Because you cannot sleep on a cup of tea. The high damage from your Greatsword abilities mix beautifully with the critical hit increases offered from the Daggers, and their passive skills complement each other perfectly. Whether you’re looking to melt bosses or be a pest in PVP encounters, you won’t find a better all-arounder in the melee space.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> Using the Greatsword with the Wand &amp; Tome—this can also be a viable option if you enjoy AOE farming using crowd control, though it’s not always ideal for single-target engagements. Even so, it can be a lot of fun to round up tons of enemies and burn them down while keeping your health topped off with ease.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-recommend-id="image://de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Big ol lion-face getting shot at by a puny crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Big ol lion-face getting shot at by a puny crossbow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-recommend-id="image://de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Big ol lion-face getting shot at by a puny crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’d like the best single-target damage available in the game, look no further than the overwhelming power of the Crossbow and Dagger combo. Using a near-constant stream of attacks against your foes lets you rack up DPS at rates unseen on other classes, and the mixture of melee and ranged skills results in a thrilling rotation that often feels like a deadly dance.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> The Longbow and Staff combo ranks as one of the most deadly builds in the game as well, letting you utterly nuke enemies with fireballs, lightning, and flurries of arrows. This is the definition of a class cannon build, and it’s definitely the way to go if you’d prefer to avoid any melee attack requirements showing up in your rotation.</p><hr><p>With all of that out of the way, make sure you also check out our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-mmo-ncsoft-how-to-get-started-1851665601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-mmo-ncsoft-how-to-get-started-1851665601">tips for getting started in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></a></span>.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero hits early access today, and players are wondering what’s new with the successor to the Budokai Tenkaichi series. Today’s guide will dive into Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Special Maneuvers that can be used to get an upper edge in the battle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are five types of Special Maneuvers that players can perform during battle. These include Transformations, Fusions, Switching, Sparking! Mode, and Emotes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-special-maneuvers">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Special Maneuvers</h2>



<h3 id="h-transformation">Transformation</h3>



<p>Characters from the DBZ series are known for their transformations, and players can relive these transformations during intense battles in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. Players must press ‘Up’ to transform on the D-Pad and select the desired transformation with Square/X, Triangle/Y, X/A or ⭘/B. The transformation will cost one Skill Count but will also improve your character’s stats.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-fusion">Fusion</h3>



<p>Fusion is a phenomenon in the Dragon Ball verse where two fighters merge into one to make a powerful fighter. Fusion in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero can only be performed when two characters that can fuse are on the team. To perform Fusion, press ‘Up’ on the D-Pad to open the Transformation menu and switch to the Fusion panel with L1/LB or R1/RB. Once fused, the two characters will be replaced by a single fused character that can’t be split again.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-switch-nbsp">Switch&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The Switch is a great system to ensure a more prolonged survival of your party in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, as it allows players to swap weaker characters with stronger teammates. During the battle, players can access the Switch Panel by pressing ‘Left’ on the D-Pad and choosing their desired character with Square/X, Triangle/Y, X/A or ⭘/B. The Switch mechanic can also be used for features like Chase Change or continuing your assault during Team Battles.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sparking-mode">Sparking! Mode</h3>



<p>Sparking! Mode is the newest Special Maneuver with Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. This ability can be activated by charging your Ki Gauge to its max and further and then spending one Skill Counter to enter Sparking! Mode. While in this mode, your abilities will be enhanced, and players can take advantage of other benefits, such as shooting blasts using Ki.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, moves such as Violent Rush or Hyper Smash during Sparking! Mode can be used to perform a flurry of rush attacks or break the opponent’s guard. It can also be used for Super Movement to improve evasiveness.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-emote-nbsp">Emote&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Special Maneuver doesn’t enhance the character’s ability but is a great addition to online play.

<p>In a thoughtful thread posted to X/Twitter, Masashi Tsuboyama said he's "very happy" that the Remake exists, diplomatically adding, "whether it's good or bad doesn't affect the original."</p>

<p>"Games and technology are constantly evolving, resulting in significant differences in constraints and levels of expression," Tsuboyama said. "This is a common issue with media arts in general, but it is not easy to maintain and appreciate the environment of the time.</p><p>"I think the value of the remake is that a new generation can play it. As a creator, I'm very happy about it. It's been 23 years! Even if you don't know the original, you can just enjoy the remake as it is. Whether it's good or bad doesn't affect the original."</p>
<p>Whilst he said "the differences between the original and the remake, 4K, Photorealism, the bonus headgear, etc. are all mediocre [in terms of the impact on the gameplay]", he took time to discuss how the controversial decision to move away from fixed camera angles to the over-the-shoulder POV more prevalent in contemporary games brings "a big change to the playfeel of the game".</p>
<p>"The thing to note is the change in camera (perspective). The change in playable camera has a significant impact on many aspects, combat, level design, art creation, etc. While the impact on the story may be relatively small, it brings a big change to the playfeel of the game," he wrote.</p> <div>

<p>"To be honest, I'm not satisfied with the playable camera from 23 years ago. Depth and angle were limited by the processing load. It was a continuous process of hard work that was not rewarded. But that was the limit.</p>
<p>"The over-the-shoulder view definitely adds to the sense of realism.</p>
<p>"In other words, it makes me want to try playing the even more immersive remake of Silent Hill 2!!!"</p>
<p>Responding to a reply from Masahiro Ito, who led creature design on both Silent Hill 2 and the Remake, Tsuboyama added: "I'm glad that it's a legitimate evolution of Silent Hill 2. I know it was hard work, but thank you for your hard work. I think it means a lot!"</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked-after-salty-fans-try-to-rewrite-its-critically-acclaimed-reception">Wikipedia had to lock down the Silent Hill 2 Remake page after repeated vandalism</a> from a small but vocal minority who are unhappy that the remake has scored so well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Boxing games and the sport itself were once a big part of my life. Fight Night Round 3, Round 4, and Champion, and even Ready to Rumble Boxing were games that I spent hours playing. I even joined a local boxing gym for a time too, training every week and managed to win a trophy. However, much as it has in my personal life, boxing has all but disappeared in the gaming scene, with boxers being special characters in other fighting games instead. Stepping into this empty ring is Steel City Interactive, whose mission is to bring boxing games back with Undisputed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Undisputed Gameplay and Features Video (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxWfICfgzXM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Undisputed has a number of different modes including career, quick fights, and prize fights. There is also online which has quick fights and ranked fights, though the single player was the main focus for this review as I was not able to find any matches online before launch.</p>


<p>What’s most important throughout is that Undisputed’s gameplay has a lot of depth to it and that it captures the fundamentals of what boxing is. This is not a sport where you just keeping throwing punches hoping for the best and Undisputed teaches you the need to strategise, work to your strengths, expose your opponent’s weaknesses, have patience, and keep your guard up because a single punch can turn the tide. Every fighter has a lot of attributes and fighting styles, such as Slugger and Swarmers. There’s attributes for every aspect of a boxer including the power of jabs, hooks, uppercuts, straights, and power punches. Then you have stats for movement speed, stamina, endurance, block strength, head health, body health, and a whole lot more. Every single one of these measurements is noticeable in each boxer, with lower rated boxers feeling sluggish compared to higher rated boxers.</p>


<p>This will be most obvious when you start career mode, where you can choose to create your own fighter or pick a fighter from the roster. The roster itself features a number of big name boxers from across the ages, along with other real life boxers. There are some notable absences, but it is still an impressive lineup. Whatever you decide you will start low rated and at the bottom of the ranks of the various divisions with a poor rating, and your job is to climb up those ladders to eventually win the six belts available.</p>
<p>Outside of fights, career mode is about navigating different menus which includes managing your team, your fight negotiations, and training. The first thing is putting your team together which includes your coach, cutman, and manager. All three are rated from E to A, and you will start with E rated teams. The coach influences your training, granting bonuses for training and traits. Traits are coach specific and are essentially attribute bonuses, with more traits unlocking the longer you stick with a coach. You can also update your coach’s ratings using coach XP or skip that and hire better coaches as your progress. The cutman is responsible for your health in and out of the ring, dealing with injuries that may be sustained during fight camps and dealing with cuts and swelling between rounds in a bout. The manager is responsible for setting up your fights, negotiating the percentage of money you’ll take home, the amount of weeks training allowed before a fight, and how many media things to do.</p>
<p>All of this will affect your income, ranking, fame. The higher each of these goes the bigger fights you can get, and the better the gyms you can train at. If you do not like the fights your manager has offered, you can manually go check the rankings and see who else is available to fight and negotiate your own contracts. You may not always be successful negotiating the fight contracts though, and that fight will then not be negotiable again for a time.</p>

<p>Once everything is in place it is time to make your way to the ring, and start trading punches. You can use either the face buttons or right analog stick to throw different punches, with the basics being jab, straight, hooks, cross, and uppercuts. You will also need to keep an eye on your stamina, which depletes as you throw punches, and take shots to the body, along with your health. As punches land, your head and body health will deteriorate, and once it reaches a critical point the boxer will get rocked. At this point, an opponent can deal extra health damage which will cause a fighter to go down. Land a significant punch and you may even knock down an opponent without having to throw additional punches, though this is hard to do.</p>
<p>If you do get knocked down, there is a minigame where you have to move indicators for the left and right analog sticks into bars and keep then within the range to get up. To be honest, I hated this minigame as it is not that intuitive or fun. Thankfully, you can turn it off in the settings. If you do this your fighter will get up automatically, though how quickly depends on their stats. What Undisputed does lack is proper flash knockouts. Even if you knock down an opponent you will have to wait for a count, and the same animation will play for every one of those. Having a proper KO, like in other boxing games, where it is obvious that the fighter is not getting up would add some extra drama to proceedings.</p>

<p>Fights can also be stopped if a cut or swelling gets too much, which is like real life, though it is amusing to hear the ref ask a fighter if they are okay with blood running down their face and their eye basically shut, but being allowed to continue. If a fighter becomes too injured to continue, they also have the same animation of disbelief played out too.</p>
<p>One big disappointment comes with the sub-par commentary. The same lines are repeated over and over again, and sometimes it does not make sense or match up to what is happening.</p>
<p>Generally the boxing is fine, though all boxers seem to be a bit sluggish despite their speed rating, and sometimes punches will be thrown in what appears to be the direction of your opponent, and yet miss. There can be a noticeable delay between inputs and what is happening on screen, which can be frustrating as you try to pull off a combo, only to be thrown off by the timing. There has also been issues of slowdown and stuttering in some fights, which needs to be addressed as early as possible. It is not always like this and when things run smoothly Undisputed is really fun.</p>
<p>It is best to follow the game’s advice and start on Intermediate difficulty, and you will discover why especially when trying out the prize fight mode. These are three fights, which will change weekly, that are set at the three difficulty modes in the Undisputed; Intermediate, Pro, and Undisputed. Intermediate will be tough enough when you first start. Pro is very tough as the AI is much more intelligent when guarding and putting together combos. On Undisputed difficulty you cannot see any of your opponent’s health and stamina bars, meaning you have to rely on visual cues to figure out the best approach.</p>

			<p>The new locations introduced in the Starfield Shattered Space expansion look really good, but they can be made to look much better with some choice mods, as showcased by a new video shared online today.</p>
<p>The video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows how stunning the new locations of the first expansion released for Bethesda's latest role-playing game can look with ReShade ray tracing and over 300 mods, including some Star Wars mods that are quite apt, given the game's space exploration mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] Starfield: Shattered Space - A Photorealistic Journey with Ray Tracing and 300+ Star Wars Mods!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0zCOvijrUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, visuals are the only remarkable feature of the Starfield Shattered Space expansion, as the expansion doesn't bring anything substantial to the table. On the contrary, it takes away some of the features that define the base game's experience, resulting in an experience that becomes a slog very quickly, even with its short length, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion, alongside the base game, is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

At its core, the game requires you to traverse its 2D environment while fighting off enemies, slowly collecting new abilities that open up new areas of the map. It’s a tried and true formula and <em>Dead Cells</em> doesn’t mess with it too much, but where it does add its own ingredients, it succeeds wonderfully. The big hook of <em>Dead Cells</em> is that in addition to being a Metroidvania, it is also a roguelike. This means that every time you die, you start back from square one without any of the hard-won upgrades and weapons you found in your previous run.</p><figure id="" data-id="caf697d137efe2d1ce944b38cfa24d52" data-recommend-id="image://caf697d137efe2d1ce944b38cfa24d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure stands on the top level of a sewer map with enemies below them" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure stands on the top level of a sewer map with enemies below them" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Motion Twin</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="caf697d137efe2d1ce944b38cfa24d52" data-recommend-id="image://caf697d137efe2d1ce944b38cfa24d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure stands on the top level of a sewer map with enemies below them" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This may sound like a relatively simple tweak but, in practice, it turns <em>Dead Cells</em> into a completely different beast. The twisting hallways of Metroidvanias are designed to make you form your own mental map and develop your own sense of direction. Play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-castlevania-game-that-changed-everything-1821969215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-castlevania-game-that-changed-everything-1821969215"><em>Symphony of the Night</em></a></span> enough, for instance, and you’ll be able to navigate it with your eyes closed and find every power-up in no time. In <em>Dead Cells</em>, however,<em> </em>each death means that the specific structure of the world shifts. The overarching structure of the map remains the same but procedurally generated areas fill out the connections between set locations, as if each run is coloring inside the lines of the same drawing with a different palette. Every run is familiar but still unique. While you’ll eventually gather skills that carry over from run to run but you are still challenged by the game itself to learn the fundamental rules of movement, enemy patterns, and how the map can fit together. Knowledge in <em>Dead Cells </em>is a skill in its own right, just as important as any weapon or upgrade for your hero.<br></p><p>The roguelike nature of <em>Dead Cells </em>means that replaying and mastering its dangerous world never gets old.

<p>October promises to be a massive month for competitive first-person shooter fans, with the rise of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 dominating so many communities and gaming scenes. Seriously, eSports is about to change drastically. That’s not to mention the amateur and casual scene, where every household will likely be playing the latest Call of Duty release on day one, all thanks to the franchise’s long-standing hype and Xbox Game Pass accessibility. But there are also many new players joining the fray. To help them, we’ve gathered a bunch of useful Black Ops 6 multiplayer tips from past experience and our community on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/your-black-ops-6-tips-for-new-players.147/#post-4159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official forums</a>!</p>



<h2 id="h-up-your-game-with-our-black-ops-6-multiplayer-tips">Up Your Game With Our Black Ops 6 Multiplayer Tips</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following countless years of playing the Call of Duty franchise, since the days of Call of Duty 2 and Big Red One on PlayStation 2, I feel I’m capable of providing a few tips and tricks to new players diving into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer on day one. Maybe I’m wrong (probably!), but I like to think I’m okay at the game and can hold my own in Team Deathmatch or Domination. </p>



<ol>
<li>Don’t be afraid to jump into a low-stakes Team Deathmatch round to practice Omnimovement. It’s a brand-new mechanic that will take some time to grasp fully, and you’ll find that sweat-lords have you beat on day one. Alternatively, for even lower stakes, load into the Training Course to practice diving, flipping 180 degrees, sprinting backward, and keeping up the momentum to take down foes. Personally, I found I need to work on sliding.</li>



<li>If you want to take full advantage of the Omnimovement system, invest in a few worthwhile perks such as <strong>Double Time</strong>, which increases Tac Sprint duration; <strong>Dexterity</strong>, which reduces weapon motion while jumping, sliding, or diving; and <strong>Gung-Ho</strong>, which allows you to reload while Tac Sprinting.</li>



<li>Most first-person shooters teach you to aim for center mass, but they provide a satisfying critical hit when you strike the head. As such, most players tend to aim high, but in Black Ops 6, damage multipliers mean hitting the limbs and torso repeatedly deal more damage faster than if you land a lucky headshot.</li>



<li>I’m not generally one to follow the meta in any game, especially in Call of Duty. I’m here to have fun. As such, I recommend you ignore what everyone else is playing with and test out weapons and builds of your own. There’s nothing wrong with experimenting with a new weapon type, like a marksman rifle, instead of opting for the fast-firing SMG the entire lobby uses repeatedly!</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a sizable number of useful Black Ops 6 tips straight from our community on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming forums</a>. As we receive additional tips from players, we’ll update this piece!</p>

<p>It’s important to always be ready to look/aim anywhere at anytime reaction time is important within any FPS game especially for COD, not to mention being able to accurately predict players movements which comes with practice and advanced map knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/members/rogerinhoimpera.113/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Rogerinholmpera</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Try to pay attention to the minimap as much as possible, which makes it easier to find out where the enemies are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Audio matters, arguably more than sight. Being able to pre-aim at a door or around a corner can make a huge difference when you know to listen for weapon shots or footsteps. It’s also good for avoiding an ambush from behind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/members/iamsammich.391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@IAMSAMMICH</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Get to know your keybinds! Especially with this new movement!</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/members/captain_fuzz.240/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Captain_Fuzz</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Centering! Make sure your crosshairs are always “centred” on where you expect enemies to come from, this way you will have to aim less drastically before you can start shooting. There’s no need to run towards a door aiming 5 feet above it, an enemy isn’t going to appear from there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-have-quick-time-events/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi series of games is known for its epic clashes, resolved with snappy quick-time events. That is why many players wonder whether the successor, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will also have Quick-Time Events. The answer to that question is yes. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will have dynamic quick-time events; check out this guide to learn how they work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quick-time events in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be activated during clashes between the opponent and you. These could be melee clashes or beam clashes, which have been classified into four impacts: speed impact, power impact, crash impact, and blast impact.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-quick-time-events">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Quick-Time Events</h2>



<h3 id="h-speed-impact">Speed Impact</h3>



<p>Starting with the Speed Impact, players can enter this dynamic, quick-time event when both fighters are trading blows. To enter Speed Impact, players must clash with their opponents using a Dragon Dash (R2/RT + X/A) or when a rush-type blast collides with a Dragon Dash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two phases to this Impact in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero: Single Strike and Rapid Strike. The winner of Single Strike decides which opponent wins the quick-time event, and the number of inputs performed during Rapid Strike determines the amount of damage inflicted on the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-power-impact">Power Impact</h3>



<p>Power Impact in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is another dynamic, quick-time event players can enter when they perform a Throw simultaneously with their opponent. The Impact event will have players holding down several buttons directly proportionate to the strength the character will use in this encounter. Players that get closest to the tip in this Impact event will win the encounter.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-crash-impact">Crash Impact</h3>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Crash Impact takes place when both players use the new movement mechanic, Step, at the same time. When they enter this Impact event, players will be assigned the roles of attacker or defender, and they again need to use a series of inputs to win. If the attacker wins this battle, the defending player will take damage. However, if the defender wins the exchange, they will protect themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-blast-impact">Blast Impact</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the most iconic quick-time event in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, also known as beam clashes. A Blast Impact is activated when both players simultaneously use two ranged Blast attacks at each other. Players must use single button presses while rapidly tapping other buttons to win this encounter. The winner of this exchange deals tremendous damage to opponents.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-review.1002663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>What kinds of lessons do we learn from our favorite pieces of fiction? Are they simply a means for escapism and enjoyment, or can they also have a tangible impact on our lives? Having played nearly every RPG from developer Atlus, my answer to that last question is a resounding, “Yes.” Metaphor: ReFantazio ponders these questions in both concrete and abstract ways through the lens of a politically charged fantasy RPG, further proving that there’s real power in the stories games can tell. As familiar as it may feel at times, it also treads new territory with a sense of clarity in its message and an empathy that ripples throughout its harsh world. From its more intimate moments to the grand gestures in its main story, Metaphor makes a loud and clear statement – one that is both relevant to our world today and a timeless examination of the best and worst parts of humanity.</p><p>Without much pretense, you’re put into the shoes of a young man in the cold-hearted Kingdom of Euchronia. With the reigning king freshly murdered and his only son (whom you have an unexplained connection with) in a curse-bound coma, a magically-driven election soon kicks off as candidates compete for the open seat on the throne, yourself included. The inner workings of the election process and your role within it changes and evolves as the roughly 80-hour story unfolds, but this setup serves as the compelling drama that propels you through a land plagued with racism, inequality, poverty, religious extremism, and exploitation. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metaphor: ReFantazio Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>These themes are at the forefront of Metaphor, and they aren’t just set-dressing – even a quick glance at its writing will tell you how it expresses its inherently progressive politics without pulling any punches. As you gain allies, interact with the people who embody these struggles, and travel across the land to earn the support of seemingly disparate societies, the story consistently demonstrates an understanding of the dynamics that give rise to such an ugly world. For a game called Metaphor, it’s not exactly interested in subtext, and in some respects, that’s to its advantage as it makes Atlus’ stance unmistakable.</p><p>Metaphor is so very clearly built on the RPG foundations of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">Shin Megami Tensei</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona</a> that to think otherwise is to simply deny facts. The Persona framework, in particular, is incredibly effective for exploring its themes and letting you build meaningful connections with the events and people on the ground level. You live life through a daily calendar system – as time marches on and the age of a new king draws nearer, choosing how to spend your segmented afternoons and nights are as vital as making sure you take care of the main objectives that drive the story’s major events. Thus, you find a balance between building bonds, progressing through monster-ridden dungeons, hitting the main quest’s deadlines, and fitting all of that into a tight timeline. Compared to other Atlus joints, it’s done with noticeably less filler, which keeps up a sense of momentum that makes sense in the context of the story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s both a comfort in familiar systems and an excitement in how they are shaken up.</p></div><p>Take the Bond/Follower and the Royal Virtue systems, for example – they are adaptations of Persona’s social links and social stats, but refined. There’s less mystery to how and when you rank up since the conditions for leveling up bonds are made clearer and progress in virtue stats are explicitly shown. It’s one way in which Metaphor delivers already compelling systems more effectively and efficiently. That incentivizes you to see its full message too, as you’ll connect with people from all walks of life who are all victims of an unjust society in some form. And for a story about gaining the trust and support of people across the world, there’s a thematic coherence to taking the time to help uplift those who’ve been left to rot in their misfortune.</p><p>Sidequests also fill out the in-between moments nicely, taking you to various optional dungeons across the kingdom either through the guise of hunting for bounties or doing a favor for an NPC. These offer more meat when it comes to combat where tough enemies litter these curated dungeons. You eventually see through the formula of dungeon layouts, which can get a little repetitive, but it gives you enough challenge to chew on and balances out the social aspects of Metaphor well. You’ll also be treated to rewarding incentives, whether it be money, stronger gear, tons of XP to level up, or ranking your social status.</p><p>Because you’re running on limited time in the calendar system, taking days out of your schedule to venture off to sidequests and dungeons is more deliberate than a casual trip into Persona 5’s Momentos. It also feeds into that feeling of a globe-trotting adventure perpetuated by the main story, so you’re constantly on the move. The fact that your homebase is a Gauntlet Runner, a stylish steampunk-inspired ship with mechanical legs you use to venture from place to place, is such a smart idea for bringing your traveling band together. It also works as a hub to improve certain bonds, virtues, or combat stats in the time that it takes to get from one location to the next. Metaphor is good about not wasting a moment and constantly giving you something worth working toward, helping all its gameplay systems sensibly feed into each other.</p><p>Metaphor wouldn’t be complete without hard-nosed turn-based combat, however. It largely uses the principles of the SMT press-turn system, where both your party and enemies are given turn icons and exploiting elemental weaknesses awards extra actions. There’s both a comfort in these familiar systems and an excitement in the way Metaphor changes things up. That is due in large part to Archetypes, which is effectively a class-based Job system that provides fun tools to fill different roles in your party of four. It offers a level of flexibility not seen in other Atlus RPGs because any party member can specialize in any of the Archetypes while also carrying skills over from others they’ve leveled up – and how you compose your party leads to wild possibilities in combat. As you get into the late-game, you’ll unlock advanced Archetypes that have some truly creative mechanics, especially when you factor in the Synthesis attacks; Not only does each Archetype have its own moveset, various combinations of Archetypes in the party let you access Synthesis attacks that consume multiple turn icons at once to unleash powerful spells for multi-hit moves or provide a major strategic advantage through unique buffs, and these can be the key to defeating the toughest bosses.</p><p>Archetypes, Synthesis attacks, and the dynamic of elemental affinities are layered with tried-and-true mechanics that have been either elevated or revised to create something fresh. While many of Metaphor’s hardest battles play out like turn-based puzzles, it’s quite the thrill when you’re able to devise a plan to overcome enemies who have specific quirks or are just flat-out powerful. There’s a satisfaction in “figuring out” the system in that it doesn’t feel like you’re exploiting it, but rather understanding how to take advantage of the tools within its flexible RPG progression.</p><p>Several other refinements mitigate the tedious grind that sometimes comes with turn-based RPGs. Weaving in a simple real-time action element mixes things up, letting you smack around an enemy early to then gain the advantage when initiating combat. It also works wonders for mitigating the tedium of churning through fodder since you can hack-and-slash low-level enemies without having to engage in a turn-based battle at all. Metaphor is also generous with the items it gives you to level up Archetypes outside of combat, even rewarding you with said items for using max-level Archetypes so you can bolster your other options. From all aspects of gameplay, whether it be in its combat systems or social sim mechanics, Metaphor is a smart evolution that streamlines the best parts of Atlus’ RPGs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even far-fetched fantasy stories can serve as inspiration to make our world a better place.</p></div><p>Also like those that came before it, Metaphor has a striking sense of style. You can see it clearly in the bombastic gothic-inspired menus and UI elements, but that ethos extends to its world and character designs too. Sure, Atlus is playing into the fantasy genre this time, but it is so distinctly of the studio’s aesthetic – one you just don’t see in other games. It’s like taking the famous Garden of Earthly Delights painting by Bosch and putting it in motion while also making it disgustingly deranged. Some of the boss designs are even inspired directly by that work, emblematic of Metaphor’s inventive grotesque style, but that’s also juxtaposed with the beautiful landscapes you visit on your journey and the anime cutscenes that bring critical story moments to life. It may not be the most technically impressive game when you look closely at its individual environments, but it makes a strong case for art direction being more important than raw graphical fidelity.</p><p>That unique, fantastical vibe is supported by excellent music from long-time Persona composer Shoji Meguro. It’s a heavily orchestral soundtrack with some wild opera-style vocals that create a sort of gravitas whether you’re stepping into a new city or ambushing an enemy mob for the 100th time. Unlike his previous works, Metaphor is more of a classical score than it is a soundtrack comprised of individual songs on an album. It’s different for sure, and it took some time for it to grow on me, but before I knew it, I’d wake up with the melodies of the battle and town themes stuck in my head, humming along to them as I got deeper into my playthrough. It’s not necessarily the emotional experience I’ve gotten from Meguro’s other soundtracks, but it is a strong and crucial part of Metaphor’s identity.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Michael Higham's Top 10 Favorite RPGs of All Time</h3></p></div><p>Metaphor has the message, the gameplay, the style, and the music, but it also has the heart to make all of those core tenets truly sing together. I appreciate that it says all the right things about defying our circumstances and that collective action is what’s going to uplift those who’ve fallen through the cracks. But it has the teeth to show that ideal it is not clean or easy, too. For example, it has an empathetic view of belief systems in general, arguing that while religion as an institution can be exploited by unequivocally bad people, it shouldn’t be conflated with faith itself being the problem – while <em>also </em>understanding that faith alone won’t sustain a just society. There’s a consistent throughline about how those in power prey on the fears and anxieties of the people as well, and it’s electoral storyline explores how manipulative tyrannical figures can be in no uncertain terms.</p><p>I was taken aback by the contrast Metaphor creates compared to other RPGs right from its opening moment, where you name yourself – the player – before doing anything else, with the tale of a banned book about a utopia driving the protagonist from there. I was constantly curious about the ways it would break the fourth wall after that, vaguely referring to this utopia as an idealized reflection of our real modern world. But for the characters in Metaphor, that’s their fantasy to strive for.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor's party reflects the ever-present theme of diversity being one of humanity’s greatest strengths.</p></div><p>Admittedly, sometimes Metaphor’s writing likes to go in circles, and its penchant for speaking plainly can manifest in repeating itself or relying on cliches. Tucked within that, however, are sharp, poetic lines that show the story knows the material it's working with. In some respects, Metaphor can be idealistic – but it’s aware of idealism’s limitations, and earns its hopeful moments by building a crew of characters who put in the work to fight the injustices within their kingdom.</p><p>For as grand as its story gets, it’s impressive that it still takes the time for camaraderie to blossom among one of the best RPG casts in recent memory. It’s an eclectic party, each of whom have a clear purpose driven by tragedy, hope, and a strong sense of what they must do. Metaphor's party reflects the ever-present theme of diversity being one of humanity’s greatest strengths. And in the year of our lord 2024, it’s nice to have a powerful story say it outright and demonstrate that belief unapologetically.</p><p>In a year that’s been full of personally affecting stories in games – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-dlc-review">its DLC</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review">1000xResist</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</a>, all of which I reviewed – Metaphor still manages to secure a special place in my heart. It doesn’t just resonate in specific moments, it also serves as a reminder that there’s still a bigger world out there, and it’s one that we can change for the better no matter how small our efforts may seem. If its main thesis is to express what fiction can do for our reality, my hope is that it resonates with others who take its message to heart, too.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>There’s a certain familiarity in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but Atlus takes the principles of its already excellent RPGs and refines them in a way that effortlessly ushers you through its brutal, and sometimes beautiful, new fantasy world. The Archetype system and all the new wrinkles it added to the turn-based battles build upon a strong foundation, and the social elements are streamlined to better deliver the most important aspects of the stories they tell. The sense of adventure you get from traveling across the kingdom and the powerful sense of purpose you have to do so drive its memorable journey, distinguishing itself from those that came before it. When I finally closed the book on Metaphor after 80 hours, I felt a unique warmth in its message, because it’s driven by the ideals of a just society smartly contextualized in a unique metanarrative. Metaphor: ReFantazio is poetic, and at times, idealistic, but it also understands its complexities and that change requires action, and that even far-fetched fantasy stories can serve as inspiration to make our world a better place.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review-in-progress.1002660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A lot has changed about both video games and the way we play them since the last mainline entry in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series. As the first direct sequel since the PlayStation 2 generation, that means there’s something charming about Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero’s old school design and presentation compared to other fighting games on the market today. It’s tougher than Vegeta’s chest plate, and imbalanced in ways that are both annoying and lore accurate. Menus are labyrinthine, training tips are sparse and sometimes not very useful. But every battle is crafted with the sole purpose of putting the Dragon Ball fighting fantasy as it appears in the anime into our hands. The fast paced ki slinging, teleport kicking, and magical hair dying is great fun (when it’s not marred by responsiveness issues). The few areas Sparking! Zero does truly try to innovate, primarily with its branching story mode and create-your-own battles toolkit, are promising too. But while I've still got a bit more to see before my final review, so far playing this brawler feels just as much like a labor of love as the effort to resurrect the series in the first place.</p><p>Arena fighters don’t have a lot in common with their traditional cousins like Tekken or Street Fighter. Instead of the fight taking place on a horizontal plane, they pair full 3D movement in largely open spaces with slimmed down movelists, trading technical complexity for spatial tactics. Tenkaichi further distanced itself from other games in its genre like Power Stone by turning up the speed, replacing throwable objects with big environmental features that can be blown up, and creating huge empty skies for wide open air combat. Other Dragon Ball games like the Xenoverse series have picked up the mantle of this particular form of arena brawling, but while both it and Tenkaichi capture the energy of Dragon Ball media – from how quickly characters can move the fight from air to ground, melee to ranged, and back again in these big beautiful spaces – the latter was always the more all-out experience without stamina bars and with tons of flair. Sparking! Zero certainly carries on that tradition.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>At least in still frames, it’s undeniable how great Sparking! Zero’s characters and environments look. Every character, no matter what era of Dragon Ball they’re from, looks better than I remembered. In motion, things are a bit more dicey, with some cutscene animations in particular being awkwardly stiff. On the whole, the sound hits the mark as well. The raucous blasts of ki explosions and booming whooshes of Z Fighters flying at high speeds are ripped straight off of the screens of old TV episodes. Most of the iconic voices of the various series are recreated pitch perfectly by their original voice actors, which is an important detail to get right. (Although, in limited cases like Perfect Cell, even a returning cast member can make a change in line delivery that had me frantically googling to confirm that my memory hadn’t been punched into a cliffside by old age.)</p><p>Another win for my inner child was the truly immense roster. 180 fighters pulled from every nook and cranny of the series are playable, many needing to be unlocked first via the shop or story modes. There are so many folks on this roster from shows or movies I haven’t watched in ages (or in some cases, at all) that I had to wonder why the very few that didn’t make the cut got snubbed. Many of these characters are repeated in some fashion – there are 19 versions of Goku, for example – but they aren’t all simply reskins. They can have different special techniques and transformation trees, meaning base level Goku from the Saiyan invasion days has a different set of moves and much lower upside than Buu Saga or Super-era Goku, who can transform into various technicolor versions of Super Saiyan. These abilities can’t be changed, but I could modify each warrior with ability items that boost things like attack power and health, though I barely noticed any benefit at all when doing so. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's been an unresponsiveness from the controls so far.</p></div><p>The controls are universal for all characters, but some on the roster interact with the standard systems slightly differently than others, which is an appreciated layer of nuance. For example, both attack buttons can be held down to unleash stronger attacks, which vary in range and application between fighters. Android characters can’t actively regain their ki in order to launch blast attacks, while gigantic characters like Janemba can’t be grabbed. Sparking! Zero makes no attempt to balance these differences, either; every time I was forced to fight a character that was canonically stronger than mine in the manga or anime, they were just as oppressive in-game as I’d expect.</p><p>Mix that with a general unresponsiveness from the controls and the tougher battles, mostly in the story mode, were extremely frustrating. Inputs are simple over all, but I've often felt lost so far when combat picks up the pace. Part of that is down to my own age and skill level (I played the last entry of this series with fervor, but that was right after Barack Obama was elected), and partly because Sparking! Zero is an overall faster game than Tenkaichi 3 was – much of the defensive suite of options requires lots of split-second precision, and I can acknowledge that 17 years later my reaction speed isn’t what it used to be. But there were also many moments where I needed to press a button in conjunction with another to do a thing, like holding guard while pressing the basic attack button to execute a grab, that led to me neither guarding nor grabbing and instead getting punched in the face, and those moments didn’t just feel like a skill issue. </p><p>I've spent a lot of time traveling back and forth between regular fights and the training mode to check and double check my understanding of when and how to use these techniques, but it hasn't really helped me execute them consistently in battle yet. Also, compared to modern day fighting games, Sparking! Zero’s training options are rudimentary at best. There’s no expectation to layout frame data and hitboxes in a less competitively-focused game like this, but targeted drills or a more nuanced customization of CPU behaviors would go a long way to help beginners and returning players fly up to the high skill floor.</p><p>The new skill points system is at least a welcome addition to your combat options. As you do damage and gain energy, a meter will charge that grants a skill point every time it fills. There’s a handful of ways to spend these points, the most common being on the unique skills each brawler has – that could be an ability that fully charges the ki meter for Vegito or Yajirobe's health restoring senzu beans. But points also need to be spent carefully on transformations and the new revenge counter system, which let me satisfyingly counterpunch foes while in the middle of a combo against me. An enhanced version of the perception counter from older games, called “super perception” here, allows you to block just about every kind of attack so long as you time it well and have a skill point to spend, too. Inconsistent responsiveness aside, these can be life saving options and like ki, which is also used for a variety of offensive and defensive maneuvers, the resource management decisions you have to make on a moment-to-moment basis really add a welcome bit of strategy to an otherwise frantic fighter.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The important story moments are prioritized instead of making you play every single skirmish.</p></div><p>There is definitely an old school approach to a lot of the progression systems and menus of Sparking! Zero. There's a long list of achievements that can be checked off organically just by playing, which usually grant in-game currency called Zeni, items, or other light cosmetics. Just about everything can be bought with Zeni – from new characters to costumes to soundtracks and even CPU attack behaviors – and you get this cash at a healthy rate that never felt like I was being pressured to spend real money for any of it. In fact, I didn’t even see any microtransaction options at all, a rarity in 2024. On the flip side, so many of the menus are a hassle to navigate, often taking you all the way back to the top layer instead of letting you go back one screen at a time. You can customize characters' abilities and costumes to be used in all modes, but those modes don’t have paths to the customize screen within them, so you have to exit one completely and go the long way to make adjustments. This was barely acceptable in 2005, and we certainly don’t have to live like this anymore.</p><p>The flagship single player mode is called Episode Battles, which is a truncated retelling of the biggest Dragon Ball stories from various characters' perspectives. Just about every Dragon Ball game has done this in some form or fashion, but this rather exhaustive version does a good job at keeping time between battles short, and prioritizing the important moments versus making you play every single skirmish (as Tenkaichi 3 did). </p><p>The standout feature this time around, though, is that certain events can actually be cleverly changed for sometimes dramatic new outcomes. That could involve making a choice during a cutscene, like I did when I decided to have Goku help Piccolo against Cell instead of waiting for Vegeta and Trunks to complete their training, which is the opposite of what went down in the TV show years ago. That lets you prevent the Cell Games from ever occurring, providing a cool glimpse at a “what if?” future where the androids live in peace with Goku and his allies. </p><p>This clear choice is way easier to execute than the other, more frequent method you are given an opportunity to alter events, which usually involves winning battles in specific ways to change their outcomes. Besides the fact that, and I must reiterate, these fights can be <em>very</em> difficult since powerful characters can become all but immune to your normal attacks and will always have the perfect defense to match your offense, it's unclear upfront what conditions must be met to unlock these alternative stories. You can lower the difficulty on a fight-by-fight basis in order to progress if you really need to, but these special tasks <em>must</em> be completed on the standard difficulty, making finding them very much an endgame activity, but I did really appreciate the effort to spice up stories that have been rehashed ad nauseam.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s still a big question mark hovering over the online multiplayer.</p></div><p>There are also custom battles, which exist somewhere between Mario Maker and the Universe Mode in a WWE game. Using a tool box full of special modifiers that limit what characters can and can’t do in a given scenario, as well as some triggers that help program particular outcomes after conditions are met, these battles can potentially resemble more of a puzzle than just mashing digital action figures together in dream situations. There’s a shoddy system for putting together dialogue so that some sort of narrative can be added to them, but the best it can do is loosely set up the make-believe stakes. I had no plans to write my own entire Dragon Ball arc, but I'm not sure the tool is up to the task even if I wanted to. </p><p>There are a couple of custom battles made by developer Spike Chunsoft baked in that follow brief exploits of Gohan’s superhero alter ego, The Great Saiyaman, but the writing only does the bare minimum to explain the context of those fights. I've gotten to try a handful of the few dozen of these battles available so far, and they don’t really stretch the imagination that much. A few of them present interesting scenarios and specific parameters for victory, like what if Nappa and Raditz weren’t killed on Earth and went to Namek, or seeing Kid Goku spar with a Master Roshi who can only be beaten by the kamehameha. But I haven't come across an “a-ha!” creation yet that really shows me the potential for this mode yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While I’ve seen a majority of the single-player offerings already, I haven’t been able to play much of the online multiplayer as of this review. Servers were on for a brief period ahead of launch, but the rounds I played were plagued with lots of lag. They closed soon after for maintenance, and aren’t supposed to reopen until release day,  so there’s still a big question mark hovering over the multiplayer in Sparking! Zero. There is a local split-screen option for people with friends in real life who want to duke it out in person, but it’s disappointingly limited to one stage: the white void of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Things like network stability and lobby features would need to be pretty solid for this game to really hang in the modern fighting game landscape, but I worry about how the responsiveness issues I experienced in offline modes will play out on the web. Besides that, this series has a history of dropping the ball when it comes to online play, so hopefully they learned some valuable lessons in the last two decades. </p><p>But from what I’ve seen of the single-player so far, the feeling of time traveling back to a simpler time when games didn’t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is a good one. Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding (mostly) as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further. But it's hard to know if the custom battles will find a community that can push its limits, let alone make decent fights worth coming back to. Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero’s Episode Battles can be very tough already, more than once crossing the line between challenging and frustrating. It often had me looking at my controller wondering if it’s broken as the disconnect between what I wanted to do versus what was happening on screen caused me to get caught in yet another 20-hit combo. It’s also old school, sometimes to a fault, as demonstrated by its archaic menus and remedial training tools. And in the absence of fully featured local play (or flesh and blood Dragon Ball enthusiast friends), a lot is riding on the strength of its online options to make this the casual hangout and brawl game for today’s Toriyama stans.</p><p>I'll be playing more this week, and once I have a chance to spend some quality time with the online options, I'll be back with my final, scored review.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-guides-hub/1100-6526875/" data-ref-id="1100-6526875">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> actually lets players try to turn back, and it's even one of the first Trophies in the game.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/tips/silent-hill-2-remake-has-a-no-turning-back-now-achievement-for-taking-the-easy-way-out/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, players can get the Trophy at the start of the game when they assume control of James. While there isn't an option for James to get back in his car and drive away, he can simply start walking in the opposite direction of the town. Unfortunately, this illusion of free will only lasts as long as it takes for James to run into an invisible wall that blocks him from going any further.

            <p>Can you believe <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> is now 10?! Doesn't time fly when you are cowering for your life underneath a table, as a hulking great big Xenomorph stalks you around a space station. Ahh, good times.</p>
<p>And, if you too are feeling a tad misty-eyed remembering all the terror and resulting screams, wishing you could have another slice of Alien goodness to add to your video game plate, well, I have something to tell you that will be right up your street.</p>
<p>Today, Alien: Isolation director Al Hope teased some exciting news with the game's community, as part of its 10th anniversary. That news? An Alien: Isolation sequel is in the works, and Hope will be back at the helm for the upcoming release. They are going to Ripley a new one, if you will.</p>

<p>Word of the sequel was casually shared along with a <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488">note</a> from Hope, which thanked all Alien: Isolation fans for their love and support over the last 10 years. Then, at the end of this post to the community, Hope simply wrote: </p>
<p>"Today, I'm delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to Alien: Isolation is in early development. We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready."</p><p>And, that is all there is to it for now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Persona</em> is one of the rare video game series where people actually talk about the menus. They’re functional, sure, but they’re also so incredibly stylish that you almost don’t mind constantly pausing to equip gear or heal your party. So when I had the chance to talk to longtime<em> Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino about his new game, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, which continues this tradition of beautiful menus, I had to ask how they do it.</p><p>The answer, as Hashino explains it, is simply a lot of work:</p><div><blockquote><p>In general, the way most game developers make UI is very simple. That’s what we try to do as well — we try to keep things simple, practical, and usable. But maybe the reason that we’ve achieved both [functionality and beauty] is that we have unique designs that we make for each and every menu. This is actually really annoying to do. We have separate programs running for each of them as well. Whether it’s the shop menu or the main menu, when you open them up there’s a whole separate program running and a separate design that goes into making it. It takes a lot of time.</p></blockquote></div><p>There are elements of craft and experience to it as well. While games like <em>Persona 3</em> had stylish menus, there was a clear evolution in later games as the designs became more elaborate and animated. You can even see a difference between <em>Persona 5</em> and <em>Metaphor</em> (see above).</p><p>Hashino says this is simply a matter of building off of previous work. “How we achieve both of them together is by the know-how that we built up over years,” he says. As an example, <em>Persona 5</em>’s menus feature a lot of angular elements, which initially created issues with legibility. “It was impossible to read at first,” Hashino says, “so we did lots of tweaking and adjusting so it became legible.”</p><p>You can explore <em>Metaphor</em>’s menus — along with the rest of the game — yourself when it launches on October 11th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Could the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) buy a larger stake of Nintendo? The fund is certainly considering the possibilities.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/71fd22ea510c-saudi-wealth-fund-eyes-raising-stakes-in-nintendo-other-game-firms.html?phrase=Nintendo&amp;words=Nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyodo News</a>, Savvy Games Group vice chairman Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al-Saud was asked about increasing the PIF’s investment in Japanese games companies, including Nintendo and others. While he said there’s “always a possibility” of it happening, the PIF wouldn’t do it without approval of their partners.</p>



<p>“It’s important to keep the communication going so you get there in the right way,” he told the outlet. “We don’t want to rush into anything.”</p>



<p>The PIF currently owns just under 9% of Nintendo, 8.58% to be exact. The fund also has ownership stake in Nexon, Koei Tecmo, and Capcom. The PIF is currently transferring its ownership shares to Savvy Games Group to “create greater synergies”, per Kyodo News. That group is led by the country’s Prime Minister.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment on a possible increase in PIF ownership. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Recently, Saudi Arabia funded the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-olympic-esports-games-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olympic Esports Games</a> in partnership with the International Olympic Committee. The first of those games will take place in 2025, and is the beginning of a 12-year deal. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Boxing fans have gone far too long without a serious contender stepping forward in video gaming. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/02/25/fight-night-champion-review">Fight Night Champion</a> is the last true heavyweight in the genre that Punch-Out started, setting the bar high with its weighty focus on realism over a decade ago in 2010. Developer Steel City Interactive's presumptively named Undisputed comes in as the plucky underdog looking to knock the king off its throne, but while it is a split decision in some areas, it is clear the newcomer still needs to put in a bit more time on the speed bag before it can end this particular dispute. </p><p>To its credit, Undisputed does an excellent job of capturing a convincing simulation of what it’s like to rise through the ranks of the boxing world via its Career Mode. As soon as I started, I was impressed by the character customization options. There are dozens of hairstyles, tattoos, and wardrobe options, giving free rein to make an imposing, serious character or try and recreate real-life fighters thanks to its in-depth character model system. You can even make a wacky monstrosity, similar to the WWE 2K series, as the creation center lets you stretch out faces, give big dumbo ears, or rock a green afro akin to a chia pet. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Undisputed - September 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Alongside that visual creativity, Undisputed also features various fighting styles, both from a cosmetic animation and functional gameplay standpoint. Emulate Mike Tyson by creating an offensive-mind bruiser with a Swarmer who focuses on inside power punches, or float like Muhammed Ali by using reach as an Outside Fighter who wears an opponent's health down with speedy jabs while draining their stamina by dodging instead of blocking. </p><p>I created my character centering around defense, using The Wall archetype. While I may have sacrificed stamina and power, the benefit of an improved guard to reduce the damage of incoming blows and a boost to accuracy for landing punches was worth the trade-off. I found this worked out in the long run, but my lack of power and speed, combined with how slow Undisputed fights feel at the start of Career Mode when stats are lower, took some patience. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fights feel slow at the start of Career Mode when stats are lower.</p></div><p>For my first four fights, my character's stamina was drained after just a few punches, leading to many matches ending by decision. This is the one area in Undisputed where realism can drain my gaming stamina just as fast as my character’s. After two or three matches, I was on the ropes and wishing for a more arcade approach to fights – I really just wanted to knock a fool out for a change. </p><p>Thankfully, Undisputed's approach to setting up each fight was enough to keep me entertained even when the fights themselves didn’t. It follows an RPG approach to negotiating and training for opponents, mirroring how the process occurs in real life. I had control over almost everything, including the challenger I selected (within reason of rankings), how much of the fight's earnings I received, and even the amount of time I was required to spend on social media promoting the bout. </p><p>Successfully negotiating before each contest results in buffs to important features like fame, attribute improvements, and the time you have to spend training. Improving fame means you fight better opponents; Fighting better opponents results in an increase in money you receive and improved stats. You'll need to improve your attributes before getting into these fights, so allocating resources and time is a delicate balance. </p><p>On top of that you have to juggle tasks during the weeks leading up to an event. They can be spent training to get into fight-ready shape, resting to improve stamina and ensure you’re injury-free, or going on social media to reach the required level of promotion needed to fight in the first place. Weight also plays a significant role: Spend too much time on training and resting and you can end up overweight, which would mean the fight won't count – not only will you get less fame and money, but also risk injury for no gain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Finding the right combo of jabs and power punches was very satisfying. </p></div><p>Finally, managing the contracts of your Coach, Cutman, and Manager is also vital in Undisputed. Each staff member comes with abilities and perks that improve your fighter's attributes, and they grow alongside you with each win. At first, I set out to keep the same manager my whole career in the hopes of forming a bond similar to Rocky and Mickey. However, the further on into my career I got, the pros of sticking with the same team started to fall too far behind the cons. Yes, I lost a few buffs when I had to start with a new coach, but with the extra ability slots – combined with the similar base stats that came alongside the better staff members – I could recruit with my higher notoriety, and that made it easy to replace the original team as Career Mode went on. Being offered increasingly meaningful benefits to kick my loyal crew to the curb made that decision more of a chin-scratcher.</p><p>Back in the ring with those improved stats allowing me to be more active, it didn't take too many fights for me to appreciate the flow and rhythm of Undisputed's combat. Figuring out the right combination of quick jabs and power punches and the chess match of attacking the body or the head depending on the opponent's weaknesses and guard was very satisfying. Just like in real life, damage adds up and plays a vital role in fights. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Consistently aim for one side of the head with a solid combination of jabs or powerful hook shots, and nasty cuts or swollen eyes will appear. Not only do these affect stats like accuracy, but they can also lead to technical knockouts (TKOs), where the referee stops the fight. However, the more I played Undisputed, the more I found these mechanics lacking when directly compared to the 14-year-old Fight Night Champions. </p><p>In that game there are a handful of different types of cuts, bruises, and swelling. Between each round, there is also a cutman minigame that, when done successfully, gives an extra stat boost to the fighter's health and wear-and-tear. Comparatively, Undisputed's wear-down features are limited to the same three swelling, cuts, and bruises in every fight, which gets repetitive quickly. There's also no cutman minigame or interaction between each round to break up the routine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The lack of minigames leading up to fights is a missed opportunity.</p></div><p>The lack of minigames in the lead-up to fights is also a missed opportunity. Instead of automating every training boost, adding an option to hit the speed bag or work on defensive skills manually that can be applied to in-ring action would have been a helpful way to prepare. That is a standard tutorial method in sports games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-review">EA Sports FC 25</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review">NBA 2K25</a>, so I was disappointed this wasn't in Undisputed. </p><p>In fact, the only minigame that Undisputed does include is ridiculously hard – though to be fair, it shouldn’t be too easy to get up when someone has knocked you on your back. When your fighter is down you have to press and focus the right and left triggers to line up with green bars to make the count. The issue is the bars are located in different spots, so it’s a little like trying to rub your head and belly simultaneously to make your fingers do different things with precision. Improving stats like Heart doesn’t do anything to make this minigame any easier, either. It’s mostly a problem on higher difficulties, especially after I struggled to get up after going down twice while my opponent got to his feet after being knocked down seven times. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Andrew's Favorite Boxing/Fighting Games</h3></p></div><p>While the gameplay is fast and fun when fighting with better boxers, it’s not all that pretty to watch in motion, and in these ways it’s still considerably behind where the Fight Night series left off. Knockdowns and rising animations are identical each time, featuring about as much personality and variation as its commentary team. While I appreciate that Steel City Interactive got pros like Todd Grisham and Johnny Nelson to comment on fights, their descriptions of the action rarely matched what was occurring in the ring. They also had terrible memories: One moment they’d call it an even-sided round, only to make a polar-opposite statement about how my character was dominating a few seconds later as the bell rang. It sounds like they’ve taken a few too many blows to the head. </p><p>Dizzying camera angles and cornermen standing at ringside popping into the frame and blocking the fight also made for some pretty frustrating moments. While those are minor, I certainly felt my immersion slipping away when I'd get near the ropes and end up feeling like I was stuck behind a tall guy in the movie theaters mid-match.</p><p>Multiplayer is enjoyable, but be ready to run into the usual players who won’t choose anyone but the most powerful characters, Muhammad Ali and Canelo Alvarez. With nothing to balance them out online, those fights don’t have the variety they should. Your best bet is to play with friends or hope to find an opponent that wants to fight with evenly matched fighters. Otherwise, you’ll end up frustrated facing The Great One every time – which feels like the modern-day equivalent of fighting OddJob in GoldenEye.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Imagine a world where their vision of a perfect society is actually what we have today. What kind of culture and history would such a society have? Taking a step further than that, what if we were playing out a fantasy that fantasises about our ‘utopia’? That is the self-eating serpent at the centre of Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Story Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5IWiqGKcQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Kingdom of Euchronia is a world of kings and magic, curses and dragons, all put together by a supergroup team of extremely talented designers and artists at Studio Zero. Having spun out from Atlus’ P-Studio with long-time Persona director Katsura Hashino at the helm, and bringing fresh influences like Koda Kazuma (NieR Automata) and Ikuto Yamashita (Neon Genesis Evangelion) into the fold, you know you’re in for a treat.</p>


<p>In terms of atmosphere, the team’s design pedigree absolutely shines. Euchronian society is split into eight main tribes plus your persecuted ninth tribe. The eight tribes have distinct features, from big ears or shiny eyes, to basically being a bat- or dog-person. The less ‘human’ tribes are at the bottom of a fierce hierarchy, put in place by a corrupt (and frankly evil) state church, and used for inhumane experiments for magical devices that prop up the kingdom’s economy. You are part of an exiled ninth tribe, persecuted by the church and such a rarity that most people thought you just a myth.</p>
<p>The king on the board is merely a puppet of the church until he is murdered in the intro by the game’s antagonist, Count Louis. That’s when all hell breaks loose.</p>


<p>The villain of the piece is exactly as evil as he sounds, and is hell-bent on releasing Humans into society to wreak havoc in his quest for the throne. In Metaphor, Humans are tremendously powerful beasts, lifted straight out of Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights. Any semblance of humanity is long since gone, and they are now city-wrecking monsters. With Louis trying to burn down society with the help of the Humans, your mission is to create a utopia is one where all are born equal, there is no religious persecution and the church holds no sway over life and politics.</p>
<p>It’s never that simple though, is it? The game is incredibly nuanced in its themes, and explores the darker themes very well. It doesn’t hold back from bloodshed, gore or swearing for that matter — which makes sense considering that the vast majority of its population is seemingly British. God help anyone who doesn’t speak Scouse…</p>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio builds on the classic systems that you’d expect from a Persona-like, with some notable improvements. The friendship-simulator side of the game, where you need to become besties with all of your followers to unlock their ultimate powers, no longer relies on perfect answers and stalls progress if you get it wrong. Instead, a perfect answer simply nets you bonus magical currency.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have all the Virtue system, cooking, side quests, dungeon crawls and turn-based combat that you would expect from a game with the name Atlus slapped on the side of it. If anything, combat is tighter and more tactical than any of the Persona games, and Metaphor really shines for this.</p>
<p>A huge part of this brilliance is the Archetype system. Once each character awakens to their natural archetype (their Persona, basically), they can teach it to the rest of the team. This means that rather than swapping to Inari to use ice-based Magic as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/01/persona-5-tactica-preview-phantom-thieving-the-strategy-rpg-genre/">Persona 5</a>, you can simply make anyone and everyone be a mage with ice-based attacks. On top of this, once a character learns an ability, each other archetype they have unlocked can ‘inherit’ this skill for a fee.</p>

<p>All of this costs resources, of course, but the versatility this brings to combat is exceptional. The Synthesis system, where multiple party members attack together, based on the archetypes they currently wield, makes this combat system all the deeper. This is genuinely a 10/10 game if gameplay were the only metric.</p>
<p>This brings us to the sound design, which is eerily Uematsu-y. Indeed, you could easily be forgiven for thinking the famed Final Fantasy composer worked on this game, with familiar sounding motifs cropping up throughout. Music that gives you existential dread? Very similar. Dungeon stuff? Very similar. Boss fights? Very similar. It’s not quite fair to say that homework has been borrowed, but they clearly sat in the same proverbial classroom, possibly right next to each other, when doing their assignment.</p>
<p>While Persona is praised for its sound design, Metaphor went in exact opposite thematic direction, but to equal success. It is an absolute treat to listen to and you will quickly find yourself humming the music long after you’ve turned the game off.</p>

<p>For all this praise, Metaphor is less than perfect, falling down in a couple of areas.</p>
<p>The main offender lies in explaining the game’s more complex systems. The aforementioned inheritance mechanic is poorly explained, and it’s not until you’re a dozen hours in that you start to actually make use of it. Similarly, by the third city I had maxed out one of my friendships, with a message saying Strohl (the character) is ready for a new Heroic Embodiment. I had to reach the endgame — another 30 or so hours — before I learned what that actually meant, an explainer seemingly failing to pop up for me.</p>
<p>There are also graphics and optimisation issues. The game looks stunning from afar, thanks in no small part to the character and world design, but if you look closely there are myriad issues, including textures and — in one case — a character’s teeth being outside their mouth. We’ve also experienced a couple of issues with the game slowing down and a single crash on PS5. While these parts of the game feel particularly rushed, they’re at least things that are fixable in a future patch.</p>

		Metaphor ReFantazio is sublime. Persona fans will have an absolute blast playing this, and hunting out the subtle (and not-so-subtle) nods to its franchise cousin. A couple of minor annoyances make it feel a little rough around the edges hold it back from an otherwise perfect score.	</p></div>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p><span>For most casual players of recent years, invoking the name Atlus has typically been synonymous with the Persona series. One of Director Katsura Hashino’s breakout series, this offshoot of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise has grown to be one of the most stylish and compelling Japanese RPGs of recent years. Has the team at Atlus finally broken out of their mold, or is Metaphor: ReFantazio just the same game with a new mask?</span></p>
<p><span>Metaphor: ReFantazio opens with a tease of modern-day life and settings before whisking the player away into an isekai, or alternative world, within a book written about conflict and subterfuge. None the wiser of the greater story, players assume the role of a blue-haired young chap whose end goal is to subvert the election process to install a new king and instead bring a young, cursed prince to power whom most assume to be dead. Along this journey, the prince’s proxy competes to determine the rightful heir to the throne through a popular vote. How might one determine their standing in a world without ballot boxes or broad communication? By way of a floating moon in the sky adorned with the king’s visage. One empty eye socket reveals a number of faces representing the twenty or so most qualified candidates; the larger their faces appear, the wider the margin of the vote they’ve captured. Monolithic statues also appear across the various cities in Metaphor: ReFantazio allowing those on the distant reaches of the continent to still be aware of who their next ruler may be.</span></p>
<p><span>While the latter Persona titles dealt more with the psyche of human nature and Jung’s theory, Metaphor: ReFantazio presents the problems in the world in a much more overt nature, with racism running rampant in a world filled with various races and castes. The player hero has the unfortunate curse of being born as an Elda, a subrace that’s ostracized for the powerful magic and heretical views they hold. Because of this, the player and main character alike suffer an uphill battle against the inherent racism of nearly every other race and character in the Kingdom of Euchronia. The word human itself is taboo, with those humans being presented as grotesque monsters that draw direct inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch’s paintings. Inspired by may be too light of a phrasing, as many of the bosses and larger foes are one-for-one copies of one fresco of the Garden of Earthly Delights. Shin Megami Tensei has largely revolved around the various mythologies and religions of the world, so it’s intriguing to see a monster designer draw upon works not often cited in gaming. If you long for the likes of Mothman and other common Shin Megami Tensei beasts, players can research the Summoner class, which can invoke them as combat spells.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Metaphor_Screen_Mage_Fire-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The combat to Metaphor: ReFantazio should be instantly familiar to those who have dipped their toes into at least one Shin Megami Tensei title in the past decade. Turns are taking one side at a time, with characters ranked by their Speed stat to determine order. Typically, one character on either side will provide the entire team with a Press Turn icon when it’s their turn to take action, so it’s important to dispatch weaker peons before tackling the main boss. As with Shin Megami Tensei V, the effectiveness of an attack determines how many Press Turn icons are used for a given attack. A basic attack consumes one turn, while striking an enemy’s weakness or inflicting a critical hit will consume half the amount of icons. Likewise, dodging, blocking, or repelling an attack will consume twice as many icons and this goes both ways. If you can predict what an enemy’s main element will be, players can change their given Archetype or equip an accessory that might nullify that particular element. Towards the end of Elda’s journey, players can find a unique hat for the protagonist that yields an additional Press Turn icon or purchase accessories that allow a player to dodge an attack and deplete all of the enemy’s icons at once, but these won’t be in players hands until approaching the finish line.</span></p>
<p><span>Social Links have been a core component of the modern Persona series, presenting a physical manifestation of the trust between the main character and a chosen ally, whether they’re actively in the combat party or merely an outside observer. These systems play out identically to their Persona counterparts, with spending time with a given supporter yielding an additional rank and typically some form of passive boon for the Archetype that they provide the player. The system at play here has been largely simplified, with no time spent with a Follower yielding anything less than a rank-up. Gone are the days of having to take someone out for a burger two or three times before their Social Link increases. Instead, players will routinely have to pass a passive skill check based on their Royal Virtues before they can spend time with a given supporter. There is a handy menu that players can bring up at any time to quickly see which supporters are ready to take things to the next level and selecting them will instantly teleport the player into speaking distance. Many of these events will require additional criteria, such as speaking to a party member while traveling to another city or speaking to them in the evening versus the day. At each passing phase of the day, Gallica, the fairy that follows the player around during their journey, will offer a hint and let players telepathically communicate and hear the wishes of one who wishes to confide in the player.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To my chagrin, Metaphor: ReFantazio still features a limited window to proceed with the adventure through another calendar system. Players only have a limited number of days to seek the crown, and every action they do, whether it’s spending time with a confidant, reading a book, hitting the battle coliseum for fame and glory, and so on, consumes one-half of a given day. Suppose Morgana’s persistent nagging to go to sleep after exploring a Palace in Persona 5 annoyed you. In that case, you’ll have no quarter from Gallica doing the same thing after venturing into a dungeon in the daytime. Because of this, dungeons in Metaphor: ReFantazio are better suited to be tackled in a single day without taking return trips. MP is still a finite resource with very few ways to recover it outside of consumable items or leaving the dungeon to catch some shut-eye, but there are a few ways to exploit the system to the player’s benefit. The easiest is to convert the player back into a Mage Archetype and attack enemies on the open field or pass turns in combat, both provide a minimal (3-8 MP) recovery but enough to push forward if the player spends enough time grinding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I touched upon this briefly before, but the Archetype system sets Metaphor: ReFantazio apart from the Shin Megami Tensei counterparts despite both sharing similar DNA. Rather than being locked to a single arcana or Persona, each party member in Metaphor: ReFantazio draws from the same pool of Archetypes and can be equipped with a given class. These Archetypes change everything from the character’s weapon, elemental strengths/weaknesses, and even bonuses to core stats, both positive and negative. If you want to run a team of four Mages or Gunners in the back row, that’s entirely up to you. Each character levels up a given Archetype independently, and it’s almost always worth it to pick up as many levels as possible, as nearly every skill acquired in a given Archetype can be carried forward into another. This feeds into the Follower system, with advanced ranks of each Archetype being unlockable and increasing the number of skills that can be carried forward into a given class.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Metaphor_Screen_Boss_Homo_Fulquilo.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>If there’s one negative aspect to the Archetype system, it’s that it feels largely in line with the same trappings of characters in Final Fantasy VII. By giving every party member the same tools, it homogenizes the party with the only real difference between characters being their innate stats and growth. Given Archetypes dictate what type of weapon a given character can wield, that further reduces how much agency players have in creating distinctly different characters. As such, it comes down to the individual’s proclivity for role-playing and pushing characters into certain roles. If you want to turn the elven knight Hulkenberg into a glass cannon mage or give the main character a massive two-handed axe, that’s entirely your own story to write in Metaphor: ReFantazio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No matter how much I engaged with the core fundamentals of Metaphor: ReFantazio, I couldn’t escape the feeling that this was largely Persona 6 by another name rather than some new IP that could stand on its own merits. That isn’t to say that Hashino’s team hasn’t created another stylish JRPG with broad appeal, but the premise that Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy is dead. If the Persona series left you wanting more, Metaphor: ReFantazio certainly is a tale worth experiencing for yourself.</span></p>

While <em>Metaphor </em>does share a lot of gameplay elements with titles like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="83c1dc81-53b4-48e1-a653-843f76d41389" href="https://techraptor.net/games/shin-megami-tensei-v"><em>SMT </em></a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449301ab-37d8-4de3-90e4-ee04edbde40f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/persona-5-review-stylish-substance"><em>Persona </em></a>it's in the added scope of story and quality-of-life improvements that might make this the best of them all.</p>
<h2>The Tournament Of The Throne</h2>
<p>The story of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> explodes out the gate. Within the first few hours, the protagonist finds himself in the capital city and enlisted into the army, has fought a demonic-looking 'Human' in a training fort, and has returned with plans to interrupt the funeral of the recently deceased king in a hope to flush out his murderer and bring the king killer to justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This plan is immediately thrown into chaos as the magic of the deceased King appears to inform the people of the country that the next king will be decided through what is essentially a popularity contest. With his magic protecting all major candidates from assassination for the integrity of the Tournament of the Throne the protagonist is forced to put his name into the ring and journey the world to compete.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-injustice-of-the-world.jpg?itok=oTL97-AW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-injustice-of-the-world.jpg?itok=cUzo2O_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From the first moment you reach the capital you're made immediately aware of how grim many aspects of this world is</figcaption></figure><p>Starting off so strong <em>Metaphor </em>will immediately pull the players into the story, which is very important when they'll likely know they're staring down the barrel of an 80+ hour game. Once you're past that intro the Tournament continues to be an entertaining overarching story while the in-between moments are filled with location-specific plot lines and spending time with your Followers.</p>
<h2>Explore The World In Search Of Purpose</h2>
<p>Even while the deadline of the overarching plot was looming I was getting drawn into each of the different side-quests and stories. Whether that be something as simple as visiting a hot spring or needing to enter a nearby dungeon to stop the threat of an undead entity, you don't just get to learn how unique each location is, but also how unjust the world is.</p>
<p>The story structure of the Tournament, mixed with the day-to-day plot of the game, reminds me a lot of the story of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad74aac8-414b-4cf7-96b2-7e8a8f9cb11e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5-strikers"><em>Persona 5 Strikers</em></a>. Following the protagonist and his every growing party is a lot like the Phantom Thieves road trip. Where <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> perfects this process is through the incredible world-building of each stop along the journey.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-world-map.jpg?itok=CUrNNn8T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-world-map.jpg?itok=fRDVOyO4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of being based in a single city you'll find yourself travelling all across the world as part of the Tournament of the Throne</figcaption></figure><p>Each new town will offer insights into how the people live, the extremely complicated relationships that each of the races have with one another, and opportunities to learn about the history of the land. Even the little gameplay moments like ranking up your Tolerance stat would come in the form of a masked Mustari person teaching you their history and making the world feel more real.</p>
<p>New followers and party members being added as you visit these new regions also help to create interesting and grounded stories. Every person has their own tragedy that you get to work with as you grow closer to them, not only fleshing them out further as three-dimensional characters but also providing gameplay benefits in the form of new abilities.</p>
<h2>You Have Four Months, The Clock Is Ticking</h2>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> uses a day system where each major event in the story will happen on a certain day. Each of these events will work as a deadline that you'll be constantly reminded of, but all of the time up to that point you have to spend doing what you want.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-calendar.jpg?itok=yEDzwrB_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-calendar.jpg?itok=4J87IdW- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The five-day week calendar might be strange, but keeps you on pace for the four-month clock until the end of the game</figcaption></figure><p>Each day you can take two actions, in the afternoon or evening, or dive into any of the dungeons that are present in the world. On a day when you visit a dungeon or engage in combat, you won't be able to do something in the evening, but there's plenty to do while traveling on your Gauntlet Runner so you can still make progress.</p>
<p>Outside of spending time with your companions you can also go shopping, visit the other cities of the world, and pick up a variety of quests. There are also a variety of date-based shops to investigate including weekly deals and items that are exchanged daily.</p>
<h2>Overworld Dungeon Combat Adds Efficiency</h2>
<p>The meat of the gameplay is in dungeon exploration and combat. The world of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is filled with unique dungeons, each normally filled with two separate objectives tied to progressing your relationships with your Followers, or just completing a quest or hunt.</p>
<p>Combat can take place in two different scenarios. The first of which takes place in the overworld, approaching enemies you can slash at them with quick attacks. If you're a high enough level this can lead to you finishing combat before it even begins, if not though it's your chance to stun your opponents and enter turn-based combat with an advantage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-dungeon-exploration.jpg?itok=prnPrVCi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-dungeon-exploration.jpg?itok=7agNn5qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rush through dungeons and when you're strong enough smacking enemies is enough</figcaption></figure><p>Turn-based combat is as you'd expect. Taking it in turns you'll move through your party dealing out special attacks and elemental abilities. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> uses the same turn counter system from Shin Megami Tensei, starting each round you'll have as many turns as you have characters. Dealing critical hits or exploiting weaknesses will add an additional turn counter while having an enemy dodge or repel your attack will lead you to lose additional turns.</p>
<p>This style of turn-based combat is still my favorite, pushing you to really exploit weaknesses and alter your setup as you enter new areas. It also means for any of the incredibly tough boss fights if you do fail you have nearly limitless potential to respec your team and reapproach the fight.</p>
<p>For a title as long as it is I thoroughly appreciated the ability to essentially 'skip' combat when you were powerful enough, I did feel like the threshold for when combat would occur on the overworld only was a bit tough to reach. I would appreciate when I could get through combat quickly and understand when combat was against a tough enemy, but there was a strange limbo period in the middle that would mean I'd get pulled into turn-based combat, but it would only take a round or so of combat to complete it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-turn-system.jpg?itok=_dH8PMC6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-turn-system.jpg?itok=QLC9OJWL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plan your attacks wisely to be able to capitalize no only on damage, but earn more turns</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> Archetypes Allow Limitless Possibilities</h2>
<p>Each character's prowess in battle is based upon their stats along with what Archetype they have equipped to them. The Archetypes are this game's equivalent of the Demons or the Persona. Each Archetype has a different theme, such as Knight, Warrior, or Brawler, and with that comes access to a variety of different active and passive abilities.</p>
<p>With each battle won you'll not only be leveling up the party members, but also their Archetype. Leveling up Archetypes can then give you access to more powerful Archetypes, this can be in the form of a linear evolution or into a completely different Archetype Tree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-archetype-map.jpg?itok=G7JUMTKk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-archetype-map.jpg?itok=nU3B8DmC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of relationships to make and Archetypes to unlock</figcaption></figure><p>There is incredible freedom in the Archetype system because of two factors. The first of which is that each party member can use any Archetype as long as they have enough points in it, the second factor is that with each Archetype you have active you can also equip skills from any of the other Archetypes that the character has previously unlocked.</p>
<p>In a single character, you can choose between over thirty different Archetypes, with a core set of abilities, and abilities from other Archetypes giving you unique combinations, powerful damaging attacks, or passive buffs. Even while leveling up one Archetype path I was constantly considering the different ways that their abilities could synergize with another.</p>
<h2>Improving The Formula</h2>
<p>As you already know from my review if you're a long-time player of <em>SMT </em>or <em>Persona </em>titles there's a lot here that's going to be immediately understood by you. Spending time with Followers to improve their rankings, familiar combat system, leveling up stand-like abilities to unlock further powers, etc</p>
<p>What <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does that's so amazing is add a wave of quality of life improvements to all of them to allow them to pack as much into this game as possible, but for it to never feel tedious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-follower-level-up.jpg?itok=XMlrSW9P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-follower-level-up.jpg?itok=m3GbDHFb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From this screen you can not only see what abilities your Followers will gain but leap to them immediately</figcaption></figure><p>Followers rank up based on your Protagonist's social stats and the timeline of the game and when they're ready to rank up there is a clear indication of it. If your Follower is ready to rank up but you don't have a skill the game will even let you know which one to work on. Once you're ready that same menu will take you right to the Follower.</p>
<p>This ease of movement also extends to the different quests you'll take on, getting to move from city to city with ease, and even navigating within the cities itself.</p>
<p>Overleveled combat occurring on the overworld is a reward to those who like to over-prepare, not punishing you for being powerful but instead giving you the fun sensation of showing off that power.</p>
<p>Each Archetype being unlockable to each party member also adds an insane variety of customization in a different way to unlock and fuse demons that you might be familiar with. Letting you tailor every last aspect of your team and their loadout allows for spectacular possibilities.</p>
<h2>The Look And Feel Of <em>Metaphor</em></h2>
<p>Stylistically, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> sits somewhere between high fantasy merged with modern sensibilities. With the merge of fantasy and futuristic-looking technology, such as swords you can surfboard around on or the Gauntlet Runner literally running instead of driving, it creates an extremely distinct setting that's immediately recognizable as well as memorable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-homan-combat.jpg?itok=APUeuWv4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor_-refantazio-homan-combat.jpg?itok=0kzsL5Sh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No one makes a horrific creature like Atlus does...</figcaption></figure><p>While in-game <em>Metaphor</em> looks on par with the majority of other Atlus titles, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. The animated cutscenes however did seem to have some very strange stuttering to them, whether that's just that they were at a lower framerate to the in-game moments or something more was happening under the hood I'm not too sure though. I did keep thinking while playing "I can't wait for a <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> anime to be released".</p>
<p>One core aspect that contributes to the look of this game is its incredibly flashy UI elements. While it was a treat to navigate the various menus and equipment screens there were some moments that the UI came across as a bit too flashy. Scene transitions into battles offering a wipe of color, fast effects, and bright lights did wear when near the end of my longer gameplay sessions.</p>
<p>The audio design was nailed perfectly from the vocal direction of the strong cast of main characters (I was impressed with just how much of the game was fully voiced), as well as the incredible background and combat music. Even fast-paced combat felt epic and important with the monastic chanting reverberating in the background.</p>
<h2><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>feels like an evolution of the <em>Persona </em>formula in every single way. The way it addresses the core themes of the story are better explored through the story from start to finish, the relationships with your Followers are grander in scale and really address relatable topics like shame and loss, and navigating this complicated world is the easiest it's ever been.</p>
<p>Somehow Metaphoe Re Fantazio manages to add so much more gameplay into the formula while covering far less 'in-universe' time providing more substance without taking away from the narrative weight of what's going on in the story.</p>
<p>Gamers who have been waiting to find a good entry point into titles like <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> or <em>Persona </em>should know that this is the best place to climb aboard, and for the long-standing fans who are already aware of the high-quality work that Atlus puts out be excited because you're not ready for how great the adventure you're about to take is going to be.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review-kamehameha-x100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review-%E2%80%93-kamehameha-x100.1002576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review-kamehameha-x100<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited sequel to the <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> series has a lot of nostalgia to live up to. <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em> has more material to work with than ever, and making it a cohesive package is no easy feat.</p>
<p>For Shenron's sake, among the 182 characters, there are seven Gokus and six Vegetas, each with their own set of transformations and fusions (that doesn't even include Goku Black or Baby Vegeta!). There's a bunch of new material from <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> to cover, too.</p>
<p>For the most part, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em> handles all of that and more with care and heart, all while lovingly bringing your favorite spikey-haired Saiyans to life in Unreal Engine 5. Even if you get tired of hearing Goku yell "Kamehameha" a hundred times, at least it'll look good.</p>

<h2>Watch Those Sparks Fly</h2>
<p>Above all, <em>Dragon Ball</em> is all about the fights, and <em>Sparking! Zero</em> takes that seriously. The fighting system here is very comparable to the old-school <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> games, meaning it's frantic, energetic, and fast. However, there's an order to the chaos, especially with the meaningful updates to the combat introduced here.</p>
<p>For example, Revenge Counters let you use a Skill Count to get a breather while your enemy is mid-combo, sort of like a burst in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/guilty-gear-strive-changed-fighting-games-rollback-netcode"><em>Guilty Gear</em></a>. Short Dashes also give you more options for close-quarters maneuverability and mid-combo versatility.</p>
<p>The camera, often a source of frustration in arena fighters, follows the action fairly well, too. When there's a quick series of high-speed movements, the camera goes for a bird's-eye view, valuing clarity instead of staying locked over the shoulder. It's another welcome upgrade, though it still struggles once you're in a corner.</p>

<p>No matter whether you're on the offensive or the defensive, it never feels like you're short of options. If you're beating down the enemy, there are at least five ways to extend your combo at any given moment, and it's up to you to mix things up, whether it's for style points or to trip up your opponent.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you're being attacked, there are tight timing windows to execute counters, vanishes, and all manners of parries. It feels like a series of high-speed rock-paper-scissors matches, but only metaphorically—this isn't like <em>Ultimate Tenkaichi</em>, thankfully.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gohan-v-cell.jpg?itok=WKR89Mlm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gohan-v-cell.jpg?itok=ujf5MOrM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gohan's dodging Cell's attacks so fast that he's a literal blur.</figcaption></figure><p>Super attacks, of course, are the flashiest part of combat here. Every character gets three attack ones and two utility skills. These utility skills can instantly max your ki meter or give a mini power boost. For example, one of Super Saiyan Blue Goku's utility skills is a temporary Kaioken.</p>
<p>The attacks are exactly what you think: These are your Kamehamehas and Final Flashes. Some are just projectiles, while others are rush attacks where you have to make contact with the enemy.</p>
<p>I've found the tracking for these attacks to be more forgiving than what I remembered from the older <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>games. I pretty consistently could land long combos, launch the enemy across the map, and reliably add a super attack for that extra touch of damage and pizazz.</p>

<p>Once you're in the groove, it really does feel like playing an episode of <em>Dragon Ball</em>, where quick combos and tricky teleports are punctuated by trash talk and big blasts. The super attacks are also all choreographed very well, referencing specific frames from the anime while being snappy enough to not outstay their welcome.</p>
<p>To put it simply, <em>Sparking! Zero</em> is everything I wanted in a <em>Dragon Ball</em> arena fighter and more. However, if you're looking for a truly competitive multiplayer experience here, I'd temper your expectations. There's online play and ranked matches, but the game is also absolutely unbalanced—in a good way.</p>
<p>After all, Ultra Instinct Goku or Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta are absolute powerhouses in the story, and this game is all about fulfilling that power fantasy. Could Krillin beat them? Sure, anything is possible. But I don't think we're here to see an equal playing field; we're here to see that field demolished.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-broly-v-broly.jpg?itok=jU2N09BY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-broly-v-broly.jpg?itok=PQjaCbx7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Which one's stronger?</figcaption></figure><h2>Next Time on <em>Dragon Ball Z</em></h2>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em> has lots of game modes, where you can play against friends on the couch or online. There are even tournament modes to check out. But the star of the show, and what you'll likely first check out, is the Episode Battle mode.</p>
<p>You get a total of eight characters to choose from, and you follow their stories throughout the entirety of <em>Dragon Ball</em>. Goku's story is the first one you'll have, but you'll unlock more like Vegeta, Gohan, Frieza, and even Goku Black.</p>
<p>The real question is, how many more times do we need to see Frieza blow up Krillin? If you're picking up this game, chances are you already know the canon decently. This game knows that and treats the story with brevity where it's due.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-and-vegeta-v-buu.jpg?itok=2AMaX9MN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-and-vegeta-v-buu.jpg?itok=BNYvPsbZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is from Vegeta's perspective, right before they fight Kid Buu. It's perhaps the only instance of a literal rock-paper-scissors match.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, in Goku's story, the Android/Cell Saga is just three fights: one with Android 19, one with Cell, then one with Cell Jr. There's some storytelling to tie them all together, but it handles it quickly because you'll get more of the context in Vegeta's and Gohan's stories.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a weird choice at first, but I grew to appreciate it in the long run. It makes the story mode overall feel better-paced, even if you occasionally see repeats of the same scenes from slightly different angles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-yamcha.jpg?itok=NLhLzwkM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-yamcha.jpg?itok=RAD_noyG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Classic.</figcaption></figure><p>The way some scenes are presented can feel a little bit dry, with unvoiced text over essentially a slideshow. The choice is only made more jarring when certain endings have a narrator reading out the words. Regardless, despite the sometimes lacking presentation, the full-motion cutscenes make up for it.</p>
<p>Certain scenes from the anime are lovingly remade in Unreal Engine 5, and the particle effects and energy beams look wonderful in it. Even better, you can press a button to toggle between your character's perspective or the pre-determined camera angles of the scene.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-vegeta-final-flash-pov.jpg?itok=ffGj8Fby 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-vegeta-final-flash-pov.jpg?itok=0cjDtPoH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>POV: Vegeta saving the universe.</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes, it's really cool to see a unique perspective in these vignettes. Watching Piccolo kill Raditz and Goku from Goku's view is equally wild and wonderful. There's another scene where one character runs distraction while yours flanks the opponent, and it's cool seeing the distraction from afar.</p>
<p>Other times though, the first-person perspective is kind of awkward and unnecessary. Simple discussions are just a little weird, especially when the other character is really far away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-vegeta-death-pov.jpg?itok=-EIJlh1H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-vegeta-death-pov.jpg?itok=HdHSh74l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>POV: Sky green.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Love Letter to <em>Dragon Ball</em> Fans</h2>
<p>Some fights also come with unique finish conditions that open up new paths in the narrative. They can be as simple as Goku finishing off Cell before Gohan needs to join in, and it leads to a fun-yet-brief happily ever after. But others are entire mini sagas on their own.</p>
<p>These what-if scenarios in the story mode are some of the best parts of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, especially the lengthier ones. They play with the canon in interesting, fun ways, and more importantly, they bring those fun hypotheticals to life.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-alt-saiyan-saga.jpg?itok=6XzUreAH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-alt-saiyan-saga.jpg?itok=Rw5YT7c3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"All of them?"</figcaption></figure><p>If you grew up on <em>Dragon Ball</em>, there's no doubt you've heard friends say stuff like, "What if Vegeta killed Krillin on Earth and Goku went Super Saiyan early?" Heck, you might have been that kid yourself.</p>
<p>This game lives out that scenario in an eight-fight long alternate story, and it even adds a fun little twist I wasn't expecting. And that's just one of many lengthy breakaways from the known canon.</p>

<p>If you initially thought that it was weird for Goku Black or Frieza to be the protagonists of their own story modes, rest assured, they're fleshed out by all sorts of interesting hypotheticals. Frieza and Gohan especially have some of the best alternate stories as you get into the <em>Super </em>sections of the narrative.</p>
<p>As a whole, these story modes feel like a celebration of <em>Dragon Ball</em>'s most iconic moments while sparking the fans' imaginations. The weakest stories might be Jiren's and Goku Black's, since they're both confined to one arc each. Their what-if scenarios didn't feel so excitingly different from one another, often presenting slightly different flavors of "but what if they defeated Goku?"</p>

<p>If your imagination goes wild, there's also the Custom Battle mode in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, where you can play and create your own dream matchups. It comes preloaded with 37 custom fights that range from silly to dramatic.</p>
<p>For example, there's one where Ginyu turns against Frieza and body changes with him. In another, the Great Saiyaman saves the city from evil Kaiju, like Hirudegarn and Great Ape Vegeta.</p>
<p>To up the ante even more, the Custom Battle editor lets you create all sorts of scenarios yourself. The editor is a little bit tedious to use, and it could use better filters for finding names and pre-set sentences. But if you're determined, it's robust enough to make interesting cutscenes and fights.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-custom-video.jpg?itok=GJQqCMWi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-custom-video.jpg?itok=4URFNbe4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While there are&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball GT</em>&nbsp;characters available here, there isn't official story content for them in Episode Battles. Nothing's stopping you from making them yourself here.</figcaption></figure><p>Within a fight itself, you can program if-then statements to alter the flow as the fight continues. You can really up the stakes, creating an enemy that feels nigh invincible, but then another hero comes in and saves the day after your character loses a percent of health.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how enamored I am by the editor itself, but I love the idea it presents, and for the mega fans out there, I'm sure the potential of making and publishing unique <em>Dragon Ball </em>fights will be a dream come true. I'm personally excited to explore the online library a couple of days after it fully launches.</p>

<p>And as a final note for all the major <em>Dragon Ball</em> fans out there, please check out the Encyclopedia. It gives you your usage stats for each character, but more importantly, while you're perusing, you'll be on a Zoom call with Chi-Chi, Bulma, and Videl. You can ask them to dish on literally any character, and it's as delightful as you can imagine.</p>

Zero</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em> is the <em>Dragon Ball</em> game I've waited years for. I sunk so much of my youth into the <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> series, and this game just breaks the limits of what I thought would be possible.</p>
<p>Its story mode alone delivers so much more than just the narrative you know. It's a treasure trove of easter eggs and winks to the audience, all wrapped up in a beautifully rendered package.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Persona 5</em> helped the roleplaying franchise <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">break out with mainstream audiences</a>, and it’s also a game that was in the works for a long time. Early work began in 2008, just after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20994037/playstation-jrpg-persona-series-atlus-final-fantasy-4-vii-xenogears-kingdom-hearts-25-anniversary"><em>Persona 4</em></a> came out, with full development kicking off three years later. So, just ahead of the game’s launch in 2016, director Katsura Hashino — steward of the franchise since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Persona 3</em></a> — asked the team what they wanted to do next. “Everyone said fantasy,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>That game would turn out to be <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, an epic RPG that launches on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 11th. In a lot of ways, it’s reminiscent of <em>Persona</em>, with slick menus, turn-based combat, and gameplay systems forged through making meaningful connections with characters. But gone is the detailed rendition of modern-day Japan, which has been replaced by a high-fantasy realm full of fairies and kingdoms and terrible monsters called humans. The story kicks off when the king is killed and a tournament of sorts is put in place to find his successor.</p><p>For Hashino, fantasy was a chance to explore some ideas that weren’t possible in <em>Persona</em>’s modern-day setting. He really wanted a game that emphasized a long journey, for example, which is a common fantasy trope. That’s harder to do in a story about high school students. And so <em>Metaphor</em> has players traveling across a fantasy realm so large that you actually get a vehicle to help reach faraway towns and dungeons.</p><p>That’s not to say that all of the swords and sorcery mean that <em>Metaphor</em> doesn’t explore real-world issues. Instead, Hashino uses the fantasy setting as a way of broaching these topics in a different way. “Thematically, we put anxiety as the central focus of the game,” he explains. “In part because everyone has anxiety. But if we made a game focused on anxiety in the real world, we’d have to focus on really specific things about how it affects people in the modern world. And we’d drown in the specifics of it.”</p><div><p>“I thought: let’s try to make a fantasy game that only we can make”</p></div><p>In <em>Metaphor</em>, anxiety manifests not just as an emotion but also as something physical, an actual particle in the air that you can see. “That is something that we wouldn’t really be able to do in the real world,” Hashino says. “It’s more of an abstract kind of idea.”</p><p>But the shift to fantasy did have its own challenges: namely, coming up with a world from scratch. After so much time spent on games set in the modern day, Hashino gave himself a crash course in fantasy, reading books like <em>The</em> <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as a refresher. Whereas, with <em>Persona 5,</em> he could gather ideas simply by walking the streets around his office, here, inspiration wasn’t quite so simple. But he soon realized that simply imitating the existing fantasy canon wouldn’t work.</p><div><figcaption><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>“I realized that if we tried to imitate this in any way, in the characters or setting or world, it wouldn’t really reach the originals,” Hashino says. “If we tried to copy that it would just be a copy. So I thought: let’s try to make a fantasy game that only we can make.”</p><p>In the end, the game gave Hashino and the team exactly what they were looking for: a new experience. It forced the director to not only create a unique world but also imagine how the people in that world would act and live. If anxiety particles suddenly appeared in Tokyo, for instance, people would understandably be weirded out. But in <em>Metaphor,</em> they’re an everyday thing.</p><p>“Trying to put myself in the shoes of the people in this fantasy world, and how they would think, was a really interesting experience for me,” he says. “And something I’d never really done before with the <em>Persona</em> series.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
