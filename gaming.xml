            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dropout has dropped a new trailer for <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7. The latest season of the comedy talk show features the company's resident TTRPG expert, Brennan Lee Mulligan, chatting with a new suite of guests.</p><p>The new <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer provides more of what fans have come to expect from the Dropout crew. For those not aware, <em>Adventuring Academy</em> is a talk show where Brennan Lee Mulligan, the mind behind the platform's comedic actual play anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>, casually chats with a host about tabletop gaming.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>These talks span a wide number of topics in regards to play for both new and experienced players. How do you handle a player character dying? How do you make a memorable character in your game? How much worldbuilding is too much? What steps can you take to make your players feel comfortable and safe when undertaking dark or intense scenarios?&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, these episodes can veer into comedic asides and passionate hot takes. That doesn't appear to have changed in the <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer. A guest declaring their dislike of Gandalf from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Brennan's slightly changed relationship with snacking and almonds. The edict of "mandatory queerness." It is all in line with Dropout's distinct irreverent brand.</p><p>The new season's guests are a mix of Dropout regulars and other creatives in the space. They include Vic Michaelis, Robbie Daymond, Oscar Montoya, Kimia Behpoornia, Aabria Iyengar, Emily Friedman, Mica Burton, Quinns Smith, and Jasper William Cartwright.</p><p>Overall, the line-up is consistent with past seasons. Prior guests have included Dropout talent like Jacob Wysocki, Sam Reich, Lou Wilson, and Ally Beardsley, as well as other professional tabletop creatives like Jasmine Bhullar, Deborah Ann Woll, Dave Walters, Marisha Ray, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's</a> own Matt Mercer.</p><p><em>Adventuring Academy </em>Season 7 premieres exclusively on Dropout on February 20th.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

In the interview, Horii is asked directly about the decision to recast certain characters in Kiwami from their original Japanese actors. His general response as to why he recast both Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro is that while it would "certainly be safer not to recast them and avoid online criticism," the studio "felt there was no use being afraid."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horii goes on to say that they based their decision on who they most wanted to see perform. When asked directly about Kagawa playing Hamazaki, this is what Horii had to say:</p><blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Kagawa's casting as Hamazaki has been met with anger from Yakuza fans due to the actor having been <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused by multiple women</a> of <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault</a>, with one woman coming forward with what seems to be photographic evidence of the incident. In 2022, Kagawa <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/26/national/teruyuki-kagawa-groping-apology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to and apologized</a> for one of the incidents, but another of his accusers has <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said she received no apology</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement of Kagawa's casting, Yakuza fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1ns20eq/they_need_to_remove_kagawa_from_this_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacted in anger on social media</a>, getting #REMOVEKAGAWA trending on multiple networks and creating a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> that at the time of this writing has nearly 10,000 signatures. Fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1o0j7l7/rgg_studio_suppressing_removekagawa_on_instagram/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused RGG Studio</a> of suppressing the #REMOVEKAGAWA hashtag and deleting comments referencing the issue on its official Instagram page. And a number of them have pointed out that Sega has recast actors for offenses in the past - Pierre Taki was recast in Judgment back in 2019 after he was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/16/18409777/yakuza-judgment-new-actor-pierre-taki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested for cocaine possesssion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up to this point, neither RGG Studio nor Sega has offered official comment on Kagawa's casting, nor the accusations - Horii's answer is the first statement that's been offered on the subject. However, Sega did <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=lJmH7GkM8lqeVkMR&amp;v=37mtmF0FrPI&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publish a trailer on its official YouTube</a> after the wave of criticism, which introduced the Japanese voice cast and opened on a longer clip of Hamazaki. IGN reached out to Sega for additional comment ahead of this story, but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Aftermath remains a humble mom ‘n’ pop ‘n’ two cats operation, but we have grand ambitions. Slowly but surely, we grow more powerful every day. Thanks to your subscriber dollars, for which we’re eternally grateful, we’re now able to welcome two new writers into our regular rotation. You might have heard of them.</p><p>Former (until, you guessed it, layoffs) The Verge reporter Ash Parrish and prolific freelancer Joshua Rivera will soon be contributing to Aftermath on a regular basis! Ash is gonna be blogging one day per week, and Joshua is the monthly columnist <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>prophesied in our subscriber goals</u></a>. Both have written <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><u>excellent</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry/"><u>pieces</u></a> for Aftermath before, if you’d like a sample of what’s to come. We couldn’t be more excited to have them wandering the labyrinthine halls of our headquarters, by which I mean Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot emphasize enough that your subscriptions made this all possible, just as they did when we brought on Isaiah and Nicole as regular contributors last year. However, in the interest of disclosure, I will now share with you some less thrilling news: Our budget is pretty much tapped! We have <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>even grander long-term plans</u></a> – for example, hiring people full-time across multiple disciplines (and doing so at a wage that’s actually <em>livable</em>) – but we’ll need a pretty big boost to realize them.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where you come in: Consider <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/"><u>subscribing</u></a> if you haven’t already! Or tell your friends! At 5,000 paying subscribers, there is still ample room for this beautiful baby website to grow. If even a small fraction of the over-100,000 who follow us on social media or who’ve signed up for our free newsletters subscribed tomorrow, we’d be set. As is, we’re doing our best, and regardless of what the future brings, we can promise you that we’ll continue to do so. Further, we recognize that times are tough. Any support you can give – even if that means only an email address – is nonetheless appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’d like to get to know Ash and Joshua better, you can listen to the latest episode of our weekly podcast, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>. We discuss our shared histories at Kotaku, as well as current beats and interests (ask Ash about monster fucking). Then we delve into the media landscape at large, which can’t even go a single week without, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/"><u>The Washington Post laying off hundreds of people</u></a>. Next our light and breezy conversation takes us to Epstein Island thanks to alleged <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>communications with the convicted sex criminal</u></a> from individuals in and around the world of games. Oh, we also talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/"><u>this week’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> and <em>Overwatch</em>, which is <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-this-man-were-all-so-tired/"><u>no longer <em>Overwatch 2</em></u></a>, but is also not <em>Overwatch 1</em>.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually <em>buy The Washington Post</em>.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Now I have been laid off for the first time in my adult life, and rather than freaking out knowing what the landscape is like – knowing that there’s a very good possibility I will never have a full-time job like the one I left again – I’m not really that worried about it. I’m fighting against things I can’t control, so I’m gonna do the things that are within my control. I know my work is good; people wouldn’t ask me for it if it wasn’t. So I have to find more of those people, and I think I’m gonna have to at least try to see if I have the strength to continue that. We’ll see.</p><p>It’s not good advice [to other writers who might be struggling]. You can’t eat that kind of advice. You can’t eat hope. Because it’s really cliche when people ask you “How do you do this when it’s all so bad?” and I’m like “You just have to keep doing it and hope.” That has to be your main fuel, because it’s not gonna come from anywhere else because it is so damn bleak. And if you don’t got it, you don’t got it. That’s fine. It sucks because that’s not really actionable. You just have to have it. But it is what it is. I hate saying that shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Next Aftermath subscriber goal: a machine that dispenses edible hope.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh, what about you considering that you’ve been in the freelance realm for a while longer and have had to hop between those ice floes more regularly? What does that actually look like for you?</p><p><strong>Joshua:</strong> It’s tough. When I left Polygon about a year and a half ago, it wasn’t quite starting over, but it felt a little bit like that. I was at Polygon three-ish, almost four years. Even that stretch of time, it felt like the scene had changed entirely. Even now, I feel like I’m figuring it out every day. I feel like quitting every day! It’s very much like Goku training at 100x gravity.</p><p>But I don’t know. For me it’s a sense of malcontent; I have this restless itch to say something – to figure things out and put out work that means something to people. That helps them understand the world and the things they engage with a little better. This feeling of being useful and being responsible with the platforms that I have in the time that I have them.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know how much longer that is. We’re seeing institutions collapse all around us, and we can only respond so quickly. Like, Aftermath has been growing to the point that y’all could bring me on for a monthly column, but to replace some of the outlets that we’re losing is gonna take a lot of work and time and investment. Every day I’m pretty conscious of the fact that I could be out of the game tomorrow, so what should I say today while I can? That’s kind of what I think about.</p><p>Which makes it sound like my work is a little more serious than it is. Sometimes I do find the value of being a fucking goober – and not letting them beat that out of me.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><div><p>Meet The Unconventional Publishers Trying To Unfuck The Games Industry</p><p>Developers turned publishers like Innersloth and Pocketpair are leveraging their success to help other indie games thrive.</p><p><span>Ash Parrish</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-does-hollow-knights-free-upgrade-make-a-difference-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1428577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1b90ae549be74"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Key Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b90ae549be74/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-key-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>"Oh no, not again..." I say as I boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, "Am I about to play through this game for a third time?"</p>
<p>I didn't really need much to entice me back into the world of Hallownest, but after downloading the free upgrade within hours of it releasing, I somehow lost three hours of my life going through Godhome, dabbling in some Pantheons, and getting my backside handed to me by Pure Vessel and Absolute Radiance.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've picked up Team Cherry's game since I beat the sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, and I was surprised at how quickly I slipped back into The Knight's very-different skillset. His steadier movement and smaller build is more deliberate and requires a different mindset than Hornet does, but it turns out, I haven't lost those skills I developed way back when I first played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>That meant I could focus on everything this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is bringing to the table and while it isn't a huge upgrade, you can't complain — this is free, after all (if you already own the Switch 1 game, at least. But the full game is also very cheap).</p>
<figure data-uuid="516aabdad17b9"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/516aabdad17b9/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upgrade focuses entirely on the look and performance of the Metroidvania: now, on Switch 2, you can play Hollow Knight at 4K resolution (docked) and 120fps, if your TV supports it. Handheld, the resolution has been bumped to 1080p, <em>and</em> that 120fps is also an option. You can toggle the frame rate in the in-game options.</p>
<p>To most, 120fps isn't going to be noticeable, but like when I played Silksong on Switch 2, I <em>felt</em> a difference in my gameplay almost immediately. I was missing enemy swipes by mere pixels and perfectly timing pogos and nail slashes at the perfect distance more frequently. The Knight felt snappier, despite being a lot slower than Hornet.</p>
<p>That feeling was universal across both docked and handheld for me; whether I was exploring the glowing confines of Crystal Peak or soaking up the rain in City of Tears or expertly dodging attacks from the Sisters of Battle, it reminded me of what a <em>joy</em> Hollow Knight is to play, even in the wake of its improved sequel.</p>

<p>But part of that might also come from a lack of input delay, something which fans complained about in the original Switch release. I shared some brief thoughts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">our original review</a>, but it's something I genuinely never noticed until I started playing on Switch 2, and tackled the same few bosses on both consoles. I was noticeably better and more-reactive on the newer console; even when I was dying, I was consistently closer to beating the boss each time on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The star of the upgrade, however, is the improved visuals. Beyond simply bumping the resolution, which makes the game look much-more crisp, Team Cherry has also added "additional effects", which is a modest way of saying improved the lighting, the level of colour (particularly the shades of black and grey), and highlighted more details in the backdrops.</p>
<p>Now Crystal Peak's gems glimmer with an even more vibrant purple, contrasting even stronger with the dim lamps and the darker areas of the map. Greenpath's lush, verdant foliage feels more alive with deeper greens and shinier thorns. Even the Crossroads' dim, grey hallways appear more detailed, and when it's eventually overrun with infection, the orange puss glow feels like it's bursting out of the screen.</p>
<figure data-uuid="702d02162f453"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/702d02162f453/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hollow Knight was already a pretty game, but now it's much more in-line with the colour and lighting of Silksong. There are so many little things in the upgrade that give Hallownest a new glow to it; it actually has me itching to replay the whole thing again, perhaps even for a Steel Soul run.</p>
<p>The thing is, for most — especially on a first-time playthrough — you're probably not going to notice much of a difference, because many of the upgrades are small. The game was already 60fps on Switch, just with a blurrier resolution in handheld, and the jump to 120fps isn't as easy to notice as it is from 30 to 60. And the input delay is only really noticeable if you've played the game on other platforms or if you're a speedrunner.</p>
<p>So yes, Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition might not be a transformative upgrade, but it is <em>free</em>, and if you're paying attention, you'll notice and love all of the little tweaks and improvements. Honestly, the handheld visuals alone make this more than enough for me to recommend Switch 2 as the place to play the game now. Perhaps this is the platform where I will finally make the time to conquer the Pantheon of Hallownest...</p>

<p>If you've returned to Hallownest following the Switch 2 Edition's release, or are considering grabbing the game for the first time on Nintendo's newest console, vote in the polls below and share your thoughts on the upgrade.</p>
<p>Does it look or feel different on Switch 2 to you? Are you jonesing for a replay as well? Or will this be the time you <em>finally</em> dip your toes into the game? Vote away!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for the weekend to roll around, but before you can start relaxing or doing whatever you planned to do today, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle! That’s why I’m here, actually. I’ve got the quickest and best NYT Connections hints and answers that you need to dominate today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Just read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today, February 7!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-7">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 7)</h2>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections is <strong>really </strong>weird. It’s not words, but symbols, which means it’s one of the toughest NYT Connections puzzles I’ve ever seen. Here’s what you’re trying to solve today:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Roll the dice</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – It’s all just mathematics</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Used in grammatical fields</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Simple letters</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 7:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-7-972">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 7 (#972)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DIVIDED BY, EQUALS, MINUS, PLUS</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – COLON, ELLIPSIS, PERIOD, QUOTATION MARK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – I, L, T, X</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Prepare for some different nightmares in REANIMAL, with the review embargo set to lift in February. It’s a new stomping ground but familiar territory for Tarsier Studios, and fans of the studio will be hoping the developer can catch new lightning in a bottle.</p>



<p>When a new game arrives in all CAPS LOCKS, you know it’s game over. If you don’t know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tarsier Studios</a>, it’s the genius company behind the sleep-interrupting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/little-nightmares/" id="985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares</a> I &amp; II. A subtle blend of horror, puzzles, and psychological warfare: So family-friendly, then. </p>



<p>If you want to know if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REANIMAL</a> is for you, then read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-review-embargo-date-explained">REANIMAL Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run! Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming has been told that the review embargo for REANIMAL is February 11.</strong></p>



<p>The good people at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/thq-nordic/" id="1461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THQ Nordic</a> have informed Insider Gaming that you can look forward to reviews dropping on the 11th—two days before launch day!</p>

</ul>



<p>As usual, many reviews will be dropping, and you’ll quickly be able to get a sense of what REANIMAL’s about, with Metacritic and OpenCritic rounding up reviews and giving you the critical perspective.</p>



<p>Everyone knows that critics don’t know what they’re talking about, though! So, make sure to give REANIMAL a fair crack of the whip, whatever happens, and judge for yourself. If you don’t, it might come back to haunt your dreams.</p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-review-embargo-release-times">REANIMAL&nbsp;Review Embargo Release Times</h2>



<p><strong>The review embargo for REANIMAL follows a similar release time pattern to most other big releases, dropping at 8 PM PT. If you’re based elsewhere, the time will differ slightly.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Enough chit-chat, here’s a table showing you the review embargo release times for key regions.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center"><strong>Region / Time Zone</strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong>REANIMAL Review Embargo Dates &amp; Release Times</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 AM—February 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM—February 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To reiterate, there’s ample time until REANIMAL’s February 13 release date. If the company’s previous work on Little Nightmares is anything to go by, some pretty good scores are inevitable.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SEGA Taps HBO’s The Last of Us’ Dina to Lead its Next “Tentpole” Film Franchise, The House of the Dead]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/isabela-merced-star-sega-the-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation/</link>
            <guid>1428547</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Isabela Merced</strong>, who you'll recognize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/">as <strong>Dina</strong> from <strong>HBO's The Last of Us</strong></a> and <strong>Hawkgirl</strong> in <strong>James Gunn's</strong> recent <strong>Superman</strong> film, has been chosen to star in <strong>SEGA's</strong> upcoming film adaptation of its classic zombie franchise, <strong>The House of the Dead</strong>.</p>



<p>Confirmed in a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/">Deadline</a>, Merced will lead the adaptation, which is set to be written and directed by <strong>Paul W.S. Anderson</strong>, who is right at home in a gore-filled zombie world, as he's arguably most known for directing the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> films that star <strong>Milla Jovovich</strong> (who also happens to be his wife).</p>



<p>The report adds that SEGA sees the adaptation as "<em><strong>a top SEGA priority</strong></em>" and that the company wants to make it a successful and immersive franchise similar to the success of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-becomes-top-grossing-game-adaptation-of-all-time-at-the-box-office/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></strong> movies, while making it a "<em><strong>fresh take</strong></em>" on the franchise.</p>



<p>"<em>The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years</em>," said Anderson, "<em>and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart. We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that SEGA has created over a whole series of films</em>."</p>



<p>SEGA executive and producer <strong>Toru Nakahara</strong> added, "<em>Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly,</em> <em>bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Story Kitchen</strong>, a production company that'll also be working on the film that's already got its hands in other video game to film/TV adaptations, namely <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/my-lara-croft-is-not-a-sex-bombshell-says-sophie-turner/">Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider show</a></strong>, added, "<em>We're thrilled to bring together Isabela, Paul, Jeremy, and SEGA, alongside our partners at Rocket Science and CAA Media Finance. It's a powerhouse group coming together for a truly iconic property</em>."</p>



<p>With this production still seemingly in early stages of its development, it'll be a while before we see Merced take center stage here. In the meantime, it seems like her schedule might open up sooner than later for it, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO boss <strong>Casey Bloys</strong> is correct about his estimate on how many more seasons The Last of Us will get.</a></p>



<p>The last time we saw anything from The House of the Dead was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-house-of-the-dead-remake-is-coming-to-pc-playstation-xbox-and-stadia-on-april-28/">a remake that arrived back in 2022</a></strong>. If this film adaptation finds the success that SEGA and company hope it does, we may be in for a new generation of games to go along with the films.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if I told you a game of <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> didn’t have to take place in 1920s New England? What if it could, for example, take place in the neon-soaked world of 1980s Japan? Sounds pretty rad, right? Well dreams come true (whether we want them to or not)! I previously reviewed the fabulous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Cthulhu: Arkham</em></a>, and was thrilled to receive a review copy of the brand-new adventure module <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-hardcover/?srsltid=AfmBOorE18GDqZ_l9nqFt_Xb8c97pIqO4m82Rcwi7SXQzF1c0TIWPPKo" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em></a> from Chaosium.</p><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is the first of two supplemental books for <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> set in 1980s Japan. Consisting of three standalone adventures (which can also each be strung together for a longer narrative), the game sees players tracking down The Sutra of Pale Leaves, a strange religious scripture with otherworldly origins.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-pallid-masks-large.jpeg?itok=9GCydur6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1034" height="724">

  </picture><p>The book begins with a very detailed look into 1980s Japan, describing in general details the culture, how society reacted to an economic bubble, and close-up views of various aspects of daily life. Like all books in Chaosium’s <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> line, it feels well-researched, inviting you into a world that feels real and tangible (before things get extremely unreal and intangible, of course).</p><p>From there, readers will find valuable information about key characters, an overview of the plot, and rules for tracking a very specific and secret status effect throughout the campaign.</p><p><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you’re interested in <em>playing</em> this game vs. <em>running</em> this game as a keeper, I suggest you turn back now. I can’t talk about the book without spoiling at least <em>some</em> of the mystery and surprise here! Okay, you’ve been warned, here we go!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>What’s Going On With This Sutra of Pale Leaves?</strong></h2><p>While the Sutra of Pale Leaves seems to be a very old, obtuse religious text, it’s actually a kind of memetic virus created by the Prince of Pale Leaves, better known to Mythos fans as The King in Yellow.&nbsp;</p><p>Trapped underground in his home world, he seeks to infect Earth with this mind-virus by exposing as many people as possible to the Sutra of Pale Leaves.</p><p>This is where our investigators come in, though they’ll have no idea at the start of the adventure that that’s what they’re up against.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-cops-large.jpeg?itok=YhwO_3c2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1042" height="712">

  </picture><p>In fact, they could go an entire adventure (they call them Chapters in the book) without realizing the Sutra is actually a problem - such is the insidious nature of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><p>As the investigators explore 1980s Japan in the three included scenarios presented in this book (there’s another book in this setting with an additional four adventures also available called <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-2-carcosa-manifest-hardcover/" rel="nofollow"><em>Carcosa Manifest</em></a>), they’ll slowly gain Exposure Points (which are kept secret from the investigators) by coming into contact with the Sutra.&nbsp;</p><p>As these points accumulate, they’ll become more and more under the sway of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This creates a wonderfully tense, running problem that the investigators may have little awareness of (especially at the start), and as they begin to realize the danger of coming into contact with the Sutra in all its forms, they’ll have to balance the necessity of interacting with the text against the perils of infecting their minds further with it.</p><h2><strong>What Adventures are included in </strong><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>Included in <em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising </em>are three distinct adventures that can be played solo or chained together to form a longer campaign. I’ll speak briefly here about the flavor and general thrust of each one.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>First up is <strong>Dream Eater</strong>, in this adventure the investigators are called to a small town outside of Tokyo to help uncover the root cause of bad dreams plaguing the town. As they uncover more, they’ll learn that a Baku (a Japanese supernatural creature known for devouring dreams) is feeding on nightmares caused by exposure to the Sutra.</p><p>This Baku’s presence threatens the Prince of Pale Leaves, as he doesn’t want his nightmares gobbled up - and so the investigators, who have little foreknowledge of any of the goings on with the Sutra (especially if this adventure is played first), may unwittingly end up helping <em>defeat</em> the Baku! Starting slow without thrusting the players into the rush of big city Tokyo, this adventure is great when it serves as the first one played in a longer campaign.</p><p>Next up is <strong>Fan Fiction</strong>, where a talented indie manga artist has turned the Sutra into a manga to increase its viral appeal. Knowing that the Sutra as a sacred religious text won’t reach the masses, this new approach is sure to spread its influence.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>But when the adventure starts, the threat of this manga may not seem overtly apparent, as a twisted off-shoot and poorly made copy of the manga has been making the rounds, distorting the original viral code of the Sutra with disastrous consequences.</p><p>Third and final adventure in this book is <strong>The Pallid Masks of Tokyo</strong>, which begins with the ghastly discovery of a corpse in one of the nightlife districts of Tokyo. But there’s a catch… the body is completely faceless, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears!</p><p>This adventure will take investigators briefly through the seedy underbelly of Tokyo before plunging them into a psychiatric ward where machinations are in place to create an army of faceless servants for the Prince of Pale Leaves!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong> - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting run of adventures and settings in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> I’ve read in a long time. The shift into 1980s Japan is a breath of fresh air, and I love how heady the overall conceit of the campaign feels.</p><p>This isn’t cultists trying to bring a big octopus monster out of the ocean in New England, it’s a dedicated conspiracy in Tokyo trying to blend power, indulgence, and religious and spiritual fanaticism together to virally infect the psyches of as many everyday people as possible. The threat is always immediate <em>and</em> looming, and it feels complicated and conflicted in a way we seldom see in <em>any</em> tabletop roleplaying game.</p><p>And while the scope, depth, and somewhat sandbox style of adventure writing here might feel daunting for new players, I cannot recommend this book enough to players familiar with <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, or for experienced TTRPG players looking to dip their toes into the system, but aren’t interested in the Roaring ‘20s vibe of the core game.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Chaosium.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cyber-boi-youtuber-leak-lawsuit-2000666474</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>developer Build a Rocket Boy, has allegedly stated that a “very big American company” called Ritual Network, a YouTube and TikTok management agency which is actually based in the United Kingdom, is behind a more than $1 million campaign to continue smearing the critically panned 2025 open-world flop</span><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a> reports that <span>Gerhard spoke about the alleged conspiracy </span><span>in an internal meeting with other Build a Rocket Boy staff. Per an </span><span>alleged recording of his remarks, Gerhard supposedly referred to Ritual Network as “a bunch of gangsters,” and also directly named YouTuber Cyber Boi as one of the “influencers” involved in the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>smear campaign. </span></p>

 <p><span>Cyber Boi is the content creator who was recently threatened with a “formal cease and desist demand” by Gerhard, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>via the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server last week</span></a><span>, following the release of a now-deleted video about ex-Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies and the Epstein files (<a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340">Benzies stated this week that he’s never met Epstein before</a>). </span><span><em>Kotaku</em> can confirm that an email address recently listed on Cyber Boi’s YouTube channel did belong to Ritual Network.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, Gerhard’s reported claim that Ritual Network is a “very big American company” appears to be false, as the company lists Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire as its registered address. It seemingly employs fewer than 20 individuals. Also, Ritual Network’s publicly available tax returns state that its net current assets in February 2025, four months before <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 2025 release, were somewhere around £800,000, or roughly €920,000. That’s 80,000 shy of the 1 million euro sum reportedly alleged in the recording</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, Gerhard stated during the internal meeting that Ritual Network and the content creators they allegedly paid “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” for criminal charges including “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.” The purported video call also made mention of an “enhanced cybersecurity software” called Teramind, which had been installed on Build a Rocket Boy employees’ work systems without their prior knowledge.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning YouTuber drama into future <em>MindsEye</em> content</h2> <p><span>If true, that sounds an awful lot like the sort of futuristic, dystopian side plot that could be featured within the narrative of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Funnily enough, Gerhard also apparently stated that he wishes to use the names of those associated with Ritual Network in a <em>MindsEye</em> mission in the future. “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative,” he reportedly said. “We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.” </span></p> <p><span>In an official statement to </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>, Ritual Network stated that they are “not involved in the matter” and that they are also unaware of “any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims.”</span></p>

 <p>Build a Rocket Boy isn’t backing down from its allegations, however. “Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in <em>MindsEye</em>,” a spokesperson for the studio told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</p> <p>Build a Rocket Boy is ostensibly in the middle of trying to reboot the failed 2025 blockbuster. <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-reboot-update-7-leslie-benzies-2000666008">A surprise February 4 update</a> was pitched as part of</span><span> “a reset for the brand and the title” which will kick off the beginning of a “new era” for <em>MindsEye</em>. The shooter still has a less-than-50-percent positive rating on Steam and, at the time of this writing, only 40 concurrent players in the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p>The PS1 was an unrivaled time for soundtracks that go incredibly hard.

Hell, even the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanseanson.bsky.social/post/3me56ggnr222z?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Animorphs</u></a> game kinda goes. In that vein, if you have never listened to the soundtrack to <em>Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf </em>AKA<em> Looney Tunes Sheep Raider</em>, you should correct that right now because it contains at least one incredible heater.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwidcxa3fmY?list=PL8D92393BACD4F09D" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Banger.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Sheep, Dog ‘n' Wolf </em>was a bizarre celshaded stealth action puzzler that came out in 2001 starring Ralph Wolf (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NOT Wile E.

		<p>An internal video seen by Tom Henderson of<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"> Insider Gaming</a> is said to have shown&nbsp;Build a Rocket Boy CEO Mark Gerhard telling staff they had “caught the guys” who, he alleges, sabotaged the launch of MindsEye.</p>
<p>The meeting took place in January this year, during which Gerhard states that a “very big American company” is behind the plot, but “it’s probably not the company you’re thinking of.”</p>


<p>The campaign is alleged to have been run by Ritual Network, a UK based company, and they had been paying three unnamed journalists, several influencers and quite astoundingly, Build a Rocket Boy employees, all of whom worked to trash the game. Gerhard explain that they will all be served criminal complaints in person for &nbsp;“espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.”</p>
<p>“Everyone who’s involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback,” he said. That comeback will, quite amazingly,&nbsp; include using the names of the alleged criminals in an upcoming spy mission for the game.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some fun with it,” said Gerhard.. “Let’s tell the community the story before it even plays out in court. So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim.”</p>

<p>Insider Gaming spoke to <a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a> who gave this response.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims.

<p>MindsEye was released without any review copies being made available.

So we decided it’s time to figure out which mobile game you think is the best of all time with a March Madness–style bracket, presented by our friends at McDonald’s and their limited-time Hot Honey sauce, which will make your faves more perfect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bracket is made up of 32 entries divided into two categories. On one side are classics like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Doodle Jump, and Candy Crush. On the other are modern hits like Genshin Impact, Balatro, Fortnite, and Roblox. But which game deserves to be crowned as the GOAT? Only you can tell us that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bracket will pit games against each other 1v1, with the winner of each matchup moving on to the next round. All the matchups in each round will be done at the same time, with voting conducted through polls on the bottom of the page you’re currently on as well as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/igndotcom/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Instagram stories</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zombie-survival-game-humnanitz-officially-launches-into-10-on-steam</link>
            <guid>1428496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Isometric open-world zombie survival sandbox game HumanitZ first entered Steam Early Access in September 2023. In the more than two years since then, it’s gotten 18 major updates and countless patches. And now, it’s reached a new milestone: It’s out of Early Access, and Version 1.0 includes a visual and structural overhaul on top of all the previous improvements.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz3-1770330416664.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">HumanitZ takes place in a zombie-ravaged world with an emphasis on long-term progression and player choice. You can scavenge ruined cities, build bases, and try to outlast the zombies (known as Zeeks) and potentially other survivors (if you so choose). The whole game can be played solo, but there are also optional co-op, PvE, and PvP modes available on dedicated and player-hosted servers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a variety of environments across the open world, including big city streets, suburbs, farms, and forests. And you can mold those environments to suit your needs and help you survive, with several options available to you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">HumanitZ 1.0 Locations</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, you can raid a city, clear out the Zeeks, and claim an abandoned building to then turn into a fortified base using the building and crafting systems. Or you can stay away from the city and use farming, hunting, fishing, and foraging to create a self-sustaining homestead. Or you can constantly stay on the move, surviving off the resources you gather and never putting down roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These choices are all viable, but come with different levels of risk. Cities tend to be packed with necessary resources but are also crawling with Zeeks, leaving you with very little room for error. While building up your farmstead will see fewer Zeeks but runs the risk of sapping you of resources before it becomes self-sustaining. And you’ll never be able to completely avoid danger. Zombies and other hostile NPCs are constantly roaming the open world, so even if you choose to stay away from the city, you have to remain vigilant.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz1-1770330484497.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This focus on player choice has always been at the core of HumanitZ, with extensive updates and fine-tuning during Early Access. Version 1.0 has continued to build on those ideas with a broad round of refinements, upgrades, and new content. The most obvious example is its graphical overhaul, with fully remastered maps, upgraded lighting, new character models, and updated environments.  There are also several gameplay improvements, including new skill trees, the ability to multiclass, more diverse zombie types, special ammo, new equipment, new vehicles, and countless other new additions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz4-1770331040070.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And while HumanitZ will always be an open-world sandbox, there are optional quests that can provide guidance to those of us who like a bit more structure. These quests will lead you to new areas (some of which were previously undiscoverable), where you can learn the lore behind the zombie outbreak and the horrors it’s inflicted. These quests won’t force you down a linear path, they’re just there to give you some guide rails if you want them, and they can be ignored or done at whatever pace you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can choose how hard the experience is, too. Difficulty can be tuned across everything from season length and day-night cycles to Zeek respawn rates, companion health and damage, airdrops, and dynamic AI events. You can also turn on permadeath, meaning that if you die once, your game is over and you’ll have to start over again from the beginning. And for you masochists out there, you can opt into the new afflictions that add a persistent debuff and long-term consequences on top of all those modifiers, cranking the difficulty up as far as you dare</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz2-1770330971672.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Version 1.0 signals a major milestone in HumanitZ’s development, it’s far from the end. The dev team has made it clear that you can expect post-launch support, with patches and updates to add new content and address player feedback. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766060/HumanitZ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>HumanitZ on Steam</u></a> now, where you can also read the patch notes and see all the details of everything that was added and refined in the Version 1.0 release.

<p>It's only two months away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Universal Pictures and Illumination have just dropped a brand new teaser for the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which comes to cinemas across North America and Europe on 1st April 2026.</p>
<p>The Level Up teaser gives us another look at the mix of Mario worlds and inspirations, but there's a few more Galaxy nods in this trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-galaxy-movies-new-trailer-shares-a-first-look-at-yoshi">than the last</a>. Namely, you might notice Megaleg, an iconic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Rosalina makes a brief appearance once again, while Bowser Jr. gets up to plenty of no good. Yoshi also gets plenty of time in the spotlight in the 19-second trailer, including the appearance of his trademark spotted eggs and that unique tongue of his.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is apparently going to get a commercial during this weekend's Super Bowl, so we'll probably be seeing more of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, and co. pretty soon. So keep an eye out for that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/drugs-magic-guns-and-the-egyptian-god-of-death-make-for-one-hell-of-a-great-game-2000666462</link>
            <guid>1428478</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A maze of hotel rooms stands in front of me. I have nothing but my sunglasses and my fists. I slide into the nearest door, slam a thug to the ground, take his baseball bat, and chuck it at another baddie on the other side of the seedy bedroom. Before the first thug can get back up, I execute him real fast, hop over the bed, and do the same to the other knocked-down enemy. This thrilling sequence happens in less than five seconds. Later, when I walk by the carnage on my way out, I see my partner in crime, Anubis, the Egyptian god of death, clad in a slick purple suit, weighing the souls of those dead losers. He’s a weirdo like that.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124230/Jackal/"><em>Jackal,</em> out now on Steam</a>, is a new top-down indie shooter that is clearly inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hotline-miami-is-all-about-5955899"><em>Hotline Miami</em>‘s fast-paced one-shot-and-your-toast action</a>. But where <em>Hotline Miami</em> emulated the look of retro games,<em> Jackal</em> is a stylized 3D adventure that mixes realism with psychedelic art, Egyptian magic, lots of guns, and <em>Max Payne-</em>like noir voiceovers from the game’s coked-up “hero.”</p>

  <p>In <em>Jackal</em>, you have Anubis by your side. He’s a bit stoic and quick to criticize the main character, but does offer up spells that can be used during levels. These can stop time, blind enemies, or make you move really fast. Popping one of these during an ambush is a great way to get out of trouble, but you can only use a spell once during a mission, so knowing when to use it becomes part of the deadly puzzle-solving.</p> <p>Anubis and his magic aren’t the only strange parts of <em>Jackal</em>. It’s clear that this version of 1970s Las Vegas is oozing otherworldly vibes. The game’s cutscenes reinforce this with some truly trippy and wonderful uses of color, lighting, and sound. Of course, the main character is also fucked up on 20 different kinds of drugs and pills. So, how much of this is real and how much is in his rotting mind is an interesting question to ponder as you murder every gangster and cop in Vegas.</p>

 <h2>Yeah, Yeah, But What About The Killing?</h2> <p>As with any <em>Hotline Miami</em>-like game, what matters more than anything else is the movement and combat. Sure, the aesthetics and atmosphere are great in <em>Jackal</em>. But in these kinds of games, death must come swiftly, as well as the reloads. Likewise, action needs to move fast, but you should always feel like you have at least one option to get out of the chaos alive. <em>Jackal</em> nails all of this.</p>

 <p>Combat in this new indie shooter is all about being smart but relentless. Kick a guy down, grab his gun from the air, and shoot the other folks nearby; then, as he stands up, toss the gun back at his face, knocking him down again and letting you finish him with a quick execution.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666480"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666480">©Transhuman Design / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A lot of time in <em>Jackal</em> is spent tossing knives, bats, swords, guns, and more at enemies to stun them, and it always feels good. There’s also a lot of focus on making sure that you always know what’s going on. Enemies are pointed out via visual cues, guns are highlighted red so you know who to focus on, and when they run low on ammo, they go yellow. Smart choices like this help combat feel chaotic, sometimes out of control, but never messily or frustratingly so. And unlike in <em>Hotline Miami,</em> you can kick tables, chairs, and other items at enemies, which<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->along with the spells<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->adds a lot of useful options during fights.</p>

 <p>After about an hour and a half of playing <em>Jackal</em>, it looks like I’m about halfway through the game’s levels. So it doesn’t seem like this is a long experience, but there are many difficulty options, and nearly every level can be replayed with a new random layout of enemies, rooms, and weapons. That should offer a lot of replayability, especially for those chasing perfection. Just remember, someone is judging all those corpses you leave behind. And one day, will judge yours, too.</p>

<p>The Daily Mail has shared new looks at Sophie Turner in the role of Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video.</p>



<p>On February 6, 2026, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Daily Mail </a>shared photos of Lara Croft in action, showing Sophie Turner parachuting over a lake and running through the woods. Instead of Croft’s signature green top and shorts, she wore athletic wear and cargo pants for the scene, which was filmed in the rain in Surrey.</p>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the upcoming series, which will also feature Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs, and began filming in January. However, Sophie has already encountered some challenges while filming the role. She stated on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSLuQpWjlj4&amp;pp=ygUeanVsaWEgY3VubmluZ2hhbSBzb3BoaWUgdHVybmVy"> Julia Cunningham Show</a> that she’d become aware of back issues during Tomb Raider training.</p>



<p>“I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realised that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had,” she said.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/epic-games-fortnite-jeffrey-epstein-israel/</link>
            <guid>1428463</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week, a peculiar rumor picked up steam: Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced sex trafficker with <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>connections</u></a> to a plethora of the world’s most powerful men, is still alive. Why? It appears that a <em>Fortnite </em>account believed to be his was <a href="https://x.com/DissidentMedia/status/2019520779550122024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>online as recently as last year</u></a>. Today, because we live in a world gone mad, an official Epic account let conspiracy-addled X The Everything App users know that, no, this is not the case.</p><p>"This was a ruse by a <em>Fortnite </em>player,” <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>said the official Fortnite Status account</u></a> in response to a since-deleted tweet echoing the conspiracy theory. “A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite </em>account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it."</p><p>“Littlestjeff1” is a handle that appears over 20 times in the Epstein files, albeit largely <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00629064.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in association with Epstein’s YouTube account</u></a>. Additionally, at one point in 2019 Epstein appears to have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02286126.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>purchased</u></a> $25 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks. This, plus an Israeli flag next to a correspondingly named player’s profile pic on unofficial <em>Fortnite </em>stat site <a href="https://fortnitetracker.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fortnite Tracker</u></a>, was enough to convince many that Epstein was alive, well, and farming victory royales in Tel Aviv – confirming, in their minds, heaps of other rumors that Epstein never actually died. (Officially, Epstein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein?ref=aftermath.site"><u>died by suicide in 2019</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Epic Games shot down rumors that a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account sharing the same username as a YouTube account owned by Jeffrey Epstein belonged to the deceased financier.&nbsp; The company called it a “ruse” apparently orchestrated by random <em>Fortnite</em> players attempting to spoof the alias leaked in last week’s trove of Epstein files.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span> The clarification followed several viral conspiratorial posts online alleging Epstein was still alive because of a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account thought to be linked to him appearing to be active following his death back on August 10, 2019. </span><span>The most popular post regarding the littlestjeff1 </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account came from user </span><a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2019449522460541048?s=20"><span>Pirat_Nation on X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666479"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666479">DOJ</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The post in question featured several screenshots of documents from the 3 million new Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on January 30 arranged in a pinboard-like fashion to claim something wasn’t adding up about the convicted felon’s death.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One file revealed that Jeffrey Epstein had a YouTube account under the username littlestjeff1, and had purchased a film titled<em> Frenzy</em> using the account on October 25, 2014. Another file includes a $25.95 receipt for </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>V-Bucks on May 7, 2019 (although said receipt makes no mention of the littlestjeff1 username).</span></p>

 <h2>The littlestjeff1 <em>Fortnite</em> account was spoofed</h2> <p><span>A </span><i>Fortnite </i><span>account registered under the name littlestjeff1 was discovered using the website Fortnite Tracker. The account was in use during </span><i>Fortnite’s </i><span>Chapter 5, Season 1, which began on December 3, 2023. This led to the conspiracy that Epstein’s death was somehow faked and he was holed up somewhere in the world playing </span><i>Fortnite</i><span>. Suggestions that the account was active in Israel, leaning into speculation about whether Epstein at one point worked as a spy for the Israeli government, only added to the online drama.</span></p>

  <p><span>Things spread far and wide enough that the official <em>Fortnite</em> Status X account addressed Pirat_Nation’s post directly to </span><a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20"><span>refuted the theory</span></a>. <span>“A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite</em> account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube,” the company wrote on February 6. “These<em> Fortnite</em> trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it.”</span></p> <p><span>The company also clarified that it has “no record of the subject’s email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system.” According to Epic, since the public document listing the littlestjeff1 account was released, several people have “created<em> Fortnite</em> accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</span></p>

 <p>While it’s still not clear who the <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks purchase in the Epstein files refers to, he did have an Xbox account. The Microsoft platform <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">ended up banning him</a> after he became a registered sex offender.</p>

              <p><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792"><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span> are the types of games it’s hard to get a big company behind. One’s a murder mystery about teenagers killing each other, the other is a sprawling visual novel with 100 different endings. Kazutaka Kodaka, the lead on both these projects, explained how he gets games like this out the door, and it sounds like the key to getting a teenage deathmatch murder mystery approved is lying to your bosses.</span></p> <p><span>During an </span><a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/2018894744349520322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2018894744349520322%7Ctwgr%5E6dbf4a4e6bc02ae77e5bef767fc6c1208d74da40%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fyou-have-to-deceive-your-company-danganronpa-and-hundred-line-creator-kazutaka-kodaka-shares-advice-for-getting-even-the-most-unhinged-projects-greenlit%2F"><span>AMA on X</span></a><span>, a fan asked Kodaka how he managed to get projects like </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>approved when most big game companies would scoff at the idea, to which he replied that deceiving the company is your best bet.</span></p> <p><span>[Translation via </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/you-have-to-deceive-your-company-danganronpa-and-hundred-line-creator-kazutaka-kodaka-shares-advice-for-getting-even-the-most-unhinged-projects-greenlit/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>]</span></p> <p><span>“You’ve got to deceive the company,” he wrote. “Pursuing creative work while in a company is impossible if you’re someone who does whatever the company tells them. Even if it means that you have to pretend to obey, keep doing what you like. Use your company. And if something goes wrong, the one who hired you is to blame anyways lol.”</span></p>

 <p><span>I have often wondered how Kodaka managed to pull off some of the swings he takes in the </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>series. The third visual novel, </span><i><span>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</span></i><span>, has a particularly bold, anticapitalist message that pokes fun at companies who keep churning out the same franchises every year, and I would have been surprised if Spike Chunsoft cleared that when it makes the company look bad. That hasn’t stopped the company from trying to pump out more from the series, though, including a weird gacha spin-off called </span><i><span>Danganronpa S</span></i><span> that was pretty universally maligned by fans. A new enhanced remake of </span><i><span>Danganronpa 2</span></i><span> is coming later this year called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415"><i><span>Danganronpa 2×2</span></i></a><span>, which includes a new “what if” scenario with new murder cases to solve.</span></p>
