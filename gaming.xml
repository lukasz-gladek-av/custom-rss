			<p>The Little Nightmares series is among the most unique gaming franchises running today, featuring gameplay that masterfully combines platforming and puzzle-solving with a creepy atmosphere that makes each adventure incredibly tense. After the second entry in the series, however, it looked like the franchise would be changing forever. Original developer Tarsier Studios left the franchise behind after getting acquired by Embracer, passing the torch to Supermassive Games, a studio well-versed in horror games, for the development of Little Nightmares III.</p>
<p>During this year's Gamescom, I had the chance to try out the game, controlling a new character, Alone, and collaborating with another called Low controlled by another player, to escape the creepy Candy Factory and the old lady who seemed intent on eating the two. Right from the beginning of the demo, there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay. This was not a guarantee at all, given the development studio switch, so Bandai Namco, who owns the IP, definitely made the right choice, picking Supermassive Games to develop the game.</p>

<p>Though very familiar, the Little Nightmares III experience does have some important differences over its predecessors. For starters, both Alone and Low can use weapons, a wrench, and bows and arrows to defeat enemies and complete certain puzzles, such as activating contraptions, hitting unreachable switches, and so on. The biggest change, however, is the introduction of co-op mechanics, which should impact the experience quite a bit.</p>
<p>"Should" is the right word to use at this point, as the Little Nightmares III Candy Factory demo did an excellent job showcasing how the game effortlessly feels like part of the series but did a much poorer job highlighting how co-op impacts the experience. The few puzzles that required two players to collaborate, such as opening heavy grates or moving stuff around to reach new areas, didn't look particularly inspired and might have easily been single-player puzzles, too, with some tweaks. If anything, the co-op mechanics were more of a hindrance, as during a stealth sequence set in an office where Alone and Low had to sneak past the aforementioned old lady to make an example, it was easier to mess up and have to restart the sequence from the beginning. Hopefully, future showings will do a much better job.</p>
<p>For the rest, as mentioned, it was business as usual in the short time I had with Little Nightmares III. I jumped on platforms. I completed some simple puzzles with the help of items found lying around. I avoided danger by hiding or frantically running away. All of this should please fans of the series quite a bit. Despite the departure of Tarsier Studios, there's no denying the series is in some very capable hands who fully understand what makes the series so peculiar.</p>
<p>Little Nightmares III is scheduled for a 2025 release on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>It is 1959. The cold war is in full swing, television is taking over, and environments have just become fully destructible. What a time to be alive. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a> is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time. </p>

<p>Your demolitionist misdeeds will cause some trouble with the law and local townsfolk, it seems. "They will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable of ways," say the developers. It's being made by Swedish studio Far Out Games, a band of students who formed a studio some years back to "turn our school project into our dream game" and are now being published by Konami. Good work, young 'uns.</p>
<p>There's a tale to go with it all. You play as delivery boy Winston Green, who's described as a  "down-on-his-luck courier with a fiery temper and a mysterious past". It's suggested that there'll be some intrigue as his cargo gets wackier and wackier, and the idyllic town of St Monique starts to give up her secrets. </p>
<p>I think my favourite feature is how the citizens you've annoyed hang onto the back and sides of your vehicle with their legs flailing as the player takes another hard corner. Gee whiz, they sure are upset. You'll be able to leave your car and wander around on Winston's legs, GTA style, and you can unlock character upgrades like a useful bicycle. Your car can also get totalled (as seen in the trailer when the player gets badly bashed by boulder) but you'll have a means of reclaiming it. </p>
<p>It seems part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, part old-school GTA. As someone who recently rediscovered the joys of absolutely caning it around in an old banger in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> (one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a>), I can get behind a little more vehicular destruction. There's no release date just yet, but we'll let you know. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Microsoft representative has confirmed through a new statement that Black Myth: Wukong’s “delay is not due to Xbox Platform limitations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> report, the Microsoft representative stated that the team is “excited about the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on the Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science” to release the game on their platforms. The representative added that they would “prefer not to comment on deals” made by their partners with other platform holders. However, they can confirm that the “delay is not due to the Xbox platform limitations”.</p>



<p>Microsoft issued a statement in response to concerns surrounding the game’s delay, which was attributed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory leak issue</a> on Xbox consoles. Black Myth: Wukong was seemingly ‘indefinitely delayed’ as the developers are optimising it for the consoles.  Subsequently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was claimed</a> that the delay on Xbox stemmed from an exclusivity agreement with PlayStation.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new report also speculates that Game Science and PlayStation could have a non-traditional exclusivity deal for Black Myth: Wukong; however, neither entity has confirmed this officially. At the moment, there is no release date for Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>

Ryan Ellis, director at Sony-owned developer Firewalk, said: "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Soon after that announcement, reports indicated that Concord players were throwing Rivalry matches in a bid to earn experience points as fast as possible. Rivalry mode sees two teams of five players battle for dominance across best-of-seven single-life rounds. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work. Now, players are starting a match and immediately running off a platform to their doom, resulting in a win for the opposing team and the end of the round.</p><p>Rivalry matches are the perfect choice for this tactic. Win or lose, it rewards players with more experience points than other game modes. And because it’s the best-of-seven single-life rounds, as long as the whole team gets in on the act and each round takes about 30 seconds, you can finish a match in just a few minutes — again, as long as all players follow suit and you lose or win four matches in a row.</p><p>Thus, this is the quickest way to earn experience points in Concord, and thus the quickest way to earn that Platinum trophy (you need to get to reputation level 100, which takes hundreds of thousands of XP), with just two days left before the game shuts down. But be warned: your win percentage will take a hit if you keep deliberately losing. Still, that might not be much of a concern given Concord’s impending doom.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally every match of Rivalry in Concord rn because this is the fastest way to earn XP for the Platinum 😂😂 <a href="https://t.co/BZ12OV7lc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BZ12OV7lc1</a></p>— Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>IGN has verified that Rivalry matches are currently being played out in this fashion. The race, it seems, is very much on.</p><p>Some Concord players are saying there’s not enough time to grind to the Platinum trophy, so it might escape them. Others are holding out hope that Concord returns in free-to-play form, although there’s no guarantee it will return at all. As a result, the Concord Platinum trophy may go down as one of the rarest in PlayStation history.</p><p>What’s clear is that Concord itself is one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history, a game one of its developers said was in the works for an incredible eight years. There is now concern for the fate of its developer, Firewalk, and Sony faces tough questions about its upcoming live service games, including Bungie’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and Haven’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>, neither of which have a release date.</p><p>Concord’s launch was nothing short of disastrous, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>analysts telling IGN it has likely sold as few as 25,000 units</u></a>.

            <p>
PlayStation's shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">shut down its live-service flop Concord</a> just a fortnight after launch has spurred players who did buy the game to try and reach its max level via an unusual method - before it all disappears.
</p>
<p>
Players are now leaping off cliffs to end matches and earn XP at rapid pace, with a healthy chunk of XP awarded whether a team wins or loses. If Concord was set to last longer, it feels like something developer Firewalk would fix. Now, not so much.
</p>
<p>
Why are Concord owners so concerned with reaching the game's max level of 100? Well, you need to do so to unlock the "Experienced Freegunner" Trophy, and by extension the game's Platinum. Regardless of whether Concord ever returns after Sony pulls the plug and issues refunds, players will have that award - for now, likely one of the rarest Platinum Trophies available - on their profile permanently.

<p>
In a statement released last night, game director Ryan Ellis admitted Concord's "initial launch didn't land" and said the hero shooter would go offline indefinitely from this Friday, 6th September. Owners of the game's digital editions will automatically receive refunds, and have the game removed from their libraries.
</p>
<p>As for what - if anything - is next for Concord, Ellis said Firewalk would take time to "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p> <div>

<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spare-a-thought-for-poor-concord-a-kind-and-earnest-shooter-sent-out-to-die">Spare a thought for poor Concord, a kind and earnest shooter sent out to die</a>," Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote last week. "It has just released, possibly to its doom, in a nightmarish time for games that require your contiunous engagement."</p>
<p>
"Concord's snappy combat and colourful character abilities make it a perfectly playable shooter," Rick Lane ultimately wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-review">Eurogamer's Concord review</a>. "But muddled hero designs and unimaginative maps and modes leave it struggling to stand out."

            <p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not due to "platform limitations".</p>
<p>Game Science's action-RPG was released last month on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was in fact a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/">Forbes</a> the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>

<p>The full statement reads: "As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>A similar statement was previously supplied to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded">Windows Central</a>, in which Microsoft said it "can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p>Both Forbes and IGN reported the delay was due to an exclusivity deal with PlayStation, though this was disputed by other industry insiders.</p>
<p>Game Science and PlayStation have not commented publicly on the speculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale across only two platforms. Two weeks later, that number will likely have risen considerably - and will of course be boosted further by the forthcoming Xbox release.</p>
<p>However, the Xbox version remains without a release date at present, despite ongoing speculation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The initial reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 console could be happening this month, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Gamesindustry.biz's Christopher Dring revealed earlier today on X that "industry whispers" on the Nintendo console indicate that something related to it is happening this month. While a full reveal is unlikely, there's a good chance that the console will at least be formally announced, possibly with its official name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With industry whispers around ‘something’ Switch 2-related happening this month. I thought I’d remind everyone of the official list of the greatest games consoles of all time.</p>
<p>1. Nintendo Switch<br>
2. Everyone else</p>
<p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1831232577161605130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we have to take the possible Nintendo Switch 2 reveal this month with a grain of salt, there's a very good chance that something is indeed happening soon, going by precedent, as the original Switch was first revealed in October 2016. How much we will learn in this initial reveal about the system remains to be seen, but one thing seems to be certain: the wait is almost over.</p>
<p>Despite the reveal happening soon, we shouldn't expect the Nintendo Switch 2 release date to be too close. Recent rumors suggest that the console will not be released in the current fiscal year, as developers have been told not to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-miss-early-2025-launch/">expect an early 2025 release</a>. The console's release window is not the only thing that is still up in the air, as virtually nothing is known about the console, though other rumors suggest that it should have decent <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-smooth-1080p-ray-tracing/">ray tracing capabilities and performance.</a></p>

            <p>
When I catch word of a chocolate-and-peanut-butter blend of genres such as "cyberpunk survival horror RPG", my eyes light up. Literally, they light up like the pilot lights of flamethrowers, like glyphs on a cursed monolith that has been exposed to fresh blood after a billion years of dormancy. When I hear that the aforesaid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is set on a "dying space station", I begin to emit a monotonous reverberation, like <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-nasa-strange-noise-heard-astronaut.html">the mysterious banging recently heard aboard the Boeing Starliner</a>. And when I hear that it's being made by the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battletech">Battletech</a>, I extend dozens of independently cognitive motorised tentacles and begin writing a news article.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Revealed just today, Harebrained Schemes' Graft isn't just "cyberpunk", it's "post-cyberpunk". Strictly speaking, "post-cyberpunk" probably means the noughties, when the neon promise of cyborgs and endless digital networking finally gave way to the dour mundanity of everybody having a smartphone, a Facebook account and a case of low-key perma-anxiety, but I'll allow it, because I do love me a doomed space station. Here's the trailer.

<p>
Some blurb: "the Arc is dying. You must escape. Once, it hung in the sky like a jeweled moon - a continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens, all working toward some greater purpose lost to time. Bodies were replaceable, resurrection assumed.
</p>
<p>
"Now your city - one of the last - has fallen, swallowed by the encroaching darkness of the station's slow death," it continues. "Beyond its walls you find yourself in the Arc's decaying superstructure, where both power and light are precious resources. But the darkness isn't empty. It only feels that way at first."
</p>
<p>
I am enthused by this scene-setting, and by the promise of roaming "self-replicating labyrinths" and real-time shoot-outs with "feral abominations" and the "ruthless agents of a mad AI". But I'm more enthused about the game's progression or upgrades element, which has uncommon narrative gravitas. Your character can attach or, if you will, "graft" augmentations to their body, but each piece of technology you stitch to your nervous system brings with it the recollections of the previous owner.
</p>
<p>
"With each Graft, strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories flood your system," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">the Steam page explains</a>. "Now you remember the hot breath of a lover you never touched. Now you find yourself suddenly obsessing over cruel and sadistic impulses. Now you remember the monotony of an endless solitary confinement. You must choose what each of these fragments means to you, and you must live with the consequences of each choice."
</p>
<p>
In summary, "you are the Ship of Theseus. Who, or what, will you be when you escape?" Choice of nanoware dictating whether you character ends the game a serial killer or a philanthropist? Yes, I can get on board with this.
</p>
<p>
Harebrained Schemes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">"parted ways" with former parent company Paradox Interactive last October</a>, following lower-than-satisfactory sales of The Lamplighters League. Discussing the decision, Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson declared that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans". It's rumoured that Harebrained pitched a new Battletech game to Paradox before the split. I wouldn't be surprised if nascent ideas for Graft took shape while the studio were still part of the Crusader Kings publisher.

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong was the success story of August in the games industry; that much is certain.&nbsp;<span>The debut title from Chinese developer Game Science&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sells-a-whopping-10-million-copies-in-just-three-days-surpassing-industry-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million copies in three days and crushed Cyberpunk 2077's record for the highest player concurrency on Steam registered by a single player game.</span>&nbsp;CD PROJEKT's game reached 1.05 million concurrent players at its height, while Black Myth: Wukong, no doubt thanks to the massive Chinese community, has peaked at 2.41 million players, ranking second in the all-time peak concurrency Steam chart only behind PUBG: Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>The game was launched on PC and PlayStation 5, but not Xbox. At Summer Game Fest 2024, when Game Science opened pre-orders, the developer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a delay for the Xbox Series S|X version. Early on, there were whispers of a potential timed console exclusivity deal signed by Sony, although Microsoft did not <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comment</a> on that rumor. However, last week, several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the real reason was a technical one, specifically a memory leak issue.</p>
<p>Forbes was able to get a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from a Microsoft spokesperson, who denied there were any such issues that they were aware of.</p>
<p><em>As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us.</em></p>
<p>The situation remains confusing, to say the least. Is there a soft exclusivity deal for a set period of time? It's hard to say at this point. However, Black Myth: Wukong still has no release window for Xbox. Meanwhile, a rumor from earlier this week <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> there could be two DLCs for the game before the inevitable sequel goes into production.</p>

			<p>KONAMI is publishing a new game called Deliver At All Costs. A top-down action title developed by Far Out Games, a small indie studio started a few years ago in Gothenburg, Sweden, by three students, Deliver At All Costs is set in 1959 and sees players step into the shoes of Winston Green, a courier transporting 'unconventional cargo'. Here's the official overview provided by the developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plow through the city across highly destructible environments, wreaking havoc in a wide variety of vehicles. Take on bizarre deliveries and missions each with its own unique play style and mechanic. From delivering a giant flailing Marlin to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion, always expect the unexpected.</li>
<li>Explore an intricately designed world with large semi-open environments both on foot and in your vehicle. Be careful not to upset the citizens, though - they will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable ways…</li>
<li>Amidst the chaos and destruction, embark on a story of mystery and intrigue divided into three acts, with a cast of distinct and memorable characters. Witness Winston’s journey as he spirals downward into the depths of insanity.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the 1950s with aesthetics and evocative music paying homage to the classic era. Featuring 1950s design elements, an original soundtrack, radio ads, English voice acting and a UI fitting of the times - all capturing the essence of what made the 1950s iconic.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Developer Supermassive Games once dared us to survive until dawn, now the interactive slasher movie specialist wants us to be dead by daylight in The Casting of Frank Stone. This story-based spin-off of the popular asymmetric multiplayer sneak-and-slash ‘em up attempts to flesh out a backstory for the malevolent source of all evil in the Dead by Daylight universe, known as The Entity. However, aging, quicktime event-heavy gameplay, dismally superficial combat, an underdeveloped cast of characters, and a complete absence of scares make for a six-hour slog that’s barely worth staying up past your bedtime for.   </p><p>While Dead by Daylight’s character roster has swelled to include a who’s who of nightmare-haunting horror icons like Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and even walking internet memes like Nicholas Cage, The Casting of Frank Stone features an entirely original cast of villains and potential victims. This is very much to its detriment, since barely any of them leave much in the way of a lasting impression. Main monster Frank Stone (Miles Ley) certainly strikes an imposing figure in the story’s prologue, but he’s nowhere to be found for significant stretches after that. Instead, we’re saddled with a truly unremarkable cast in a tepid tale that pinballs back and forth between the filming of a low budget horror movie in an abandoned Cedar Rapids steel mill in 1980, and a clandestine meeting of strangers in an isolated English manor in the present day. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Casting of Frank Stone Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>In both time periods, the plot takes a surprisingly long time to travel short distances, with only small amounts of horror and very little stress to be found amidst meandering conversations between the playable cast of eight characters. With the exception of the likeable Linda (Lucy Griffiths), whose dry sarcasm provides some welcome laughs on occasion and who is thankfully present in both eras, the rest of the leads are saddled with dialogue that’s often clunkier than a piano solo from Freddie Krueger, and forced into relationship contrivances that aren’t given enough time to evolve. In particular, the love triangle between teenagers Jaime (Andrew Wheildon-Dennis), Chris (Rebecca LaChance), and Robert (Idris Debrand) feels rushed and leaves little space for any believable tension to develop between them, which meant that I never really agonised over steering any particular character into the arms of another with my choices.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I barely batted an eyelid while each leading man was turned into a bleeding man.</p></div><p>In fact, so little did I invest in the fates of these partially-formed players that I barely batted an eyelid while each leading man was turned into a bleeding man as the bodycount built up in the story’s second half. It’s here that the Entity’s cosmic power is properly unleashed in both the present and the past, and although there were admittedly some interesting revelations to be uncovered about this malevolent creature and how its evil is pulling Frank Stone’s strings, it all gets pockmarked by a muddled mix of confusing multiversal wormholes and glaring plot holes. All told, this sloppy and scare-less horror story feels less like a mandatory bit of backstory for fans and more like one long, unnecessary and unskippable cutscene to lead into any given Dead by Daylight multiplayer match.   </p><h2>Bad Manors</h2><p>While it may be messy and not the slightest bit memorable, The Casting of Frank Stone’s story certainly has a lot of branching paths, and so too does its environments. Unfortunately, while the dingy, subterranean tunnels beneath the Cedar Rapids steel mill and the gloomy, gilded hallways of Gerant Manor certainly ooze plenty of atmosphere, they just aren’t all that interesting or intimidating to explore. What’s worse, they’re reused far too much – over and over again I found myself plodding past the same bits of scenery like I was a member of Spinal Tap desperately searching for the stage entrance. I spent the vast majority of my time tapping through basic button prompts in cutscenes, so it felt especially limiting that when I was occasionally given full control of a character I was so rarely given anything interesting to see or do. </p><p>There are some simple survival horror puzzles to complete like pushing crates or finding keys and, in one of a number of nods to the core Dead by Daylight experience, you do get faced with the occasional generator in need of repair in order to power up a lift or door. However, whereas the process of fixing these straightforward mechanisms in Dead by Daylight is transformed into fits of heart-pounding panic since you’ve got a murderous Michael Myers from Halloween homing in on your position, here the absence of any stalking threat means they’re robbed of any real urgency and are instead just more basic quicktime events to be obediently ticked off. It’s neat that they’ve incorporated the Dead by Daylight skill check prompt here, but it does little to enhance the actual interactions in any meaningful way.</p><p>While I never struggled to repair its generators, I wish someone had taken the time to fix The Casting of Frank Stone’s inability to generate scares. Outside of life or death cutscene-based decisions, the rare enemy encounters are otherwise trivialised by a powerful weaponised camera that transforms from Super 8 to supernatural. There’s only ever one Entity-powered Frank Stone specter to face off against at a time, and all you need to do is train the camera’s viewfinder on them and hit record to sap them of all their life force. Their presence is always clearly signposted, and as a result they never got the drop on me nor did they ever get remotely close enough to pose any form of threat – I’m not sure if they’re even able to perform any attacks since they effectively stayed at a comfortable wide shot in my viewfinder; never a killer close-up. Dead by Daylight might be capable of some truly terrifying stalker escapes, but The Casting of Frank Stone is about as stressful as a spa bath in comparison.  </p><h2>Dead by Design</h2><p>Of course, since this is a Supermassive Games adventure, some of the characters can and likely will die. But in my experience of The Casting of Frank Stone, this was either because I was perfectly happy to let them go, or because I was having a sip of coffee and was too slow to reach for my controller during an unexpected and evidently majorly consequential cutscene junction. Roughly half of the cast of playable characters perished before I rolled credits, and although I was pleased to see that some of those executions were ripped straight out of Dead by Daylight – such as the piercing of a certain victim onto the sharp end of a dangling hook – I can’t say that any of these unmemorable meatsacks met their sudden deaths in any particularly inspired or shocking ways. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Once the campaign is completed, you unlock a Cutting Room Floor feature that allows you to trace each branching story path backwards and hop back into specific scenes, allowing you to pick up a story thread and twist it in a new direction by making a different decision and seeing how things play out. It’s a nice feature if you want to experience all possible outcomes, however I wish it was a little more flexible – in order to prevent one character death I was forced to replay six scenes in the lead up to the moment that decided their fate, rather than just hopping directly to that critical decision and going from there, which seemed annoyingly cumbersome. </p><p>Still, this branching chapter select is certainly handy if you want to go back and find any Dead by Daylight-inspired collectibles, with signature killers like The Trapper and The Clown shrunken down into adorable, Chuckie-sized plushies and hidden throughout each setting. This is in addition to numerous other nods to the multiplayer murder sim, like The Huntress’ rabbit mask I found on a shelf in Cedar Rapids’ curiosity shop. Dead by Daylight diehards will likely get a kick out of discovering all of these, but whether they make it worth playing (let alone replaying) a pretty forgettable horror story depends on how fiercely loyal your fandom may be. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Casting of Frank Stone’s repetitive, time-hopping horror tale is packed with dozens of character choices to consider, but really the most important decision that Dead by Daylight fans need to make is whether or not a sub-standard, six-hour story is worth sitting through purely to spot the odd recognisable weapon or slight reference to the source material’s lore. I would argue it’s not, since no single stretch of this sluggish and forgettable horror show ever comes close to matching the frantic amounts of fun to be had in a single, 15-minute Dead by Daylight trial. Unable to match the intensity of its murderous multiplayer inspiration and lagging well behind Until Dawn and The Quarry as a standalone story, The Casting of Frank Stone is a second-rate interactive slasher that just can’t hack it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It plays original Game Boy and GBC cartridges as well as Chromatic-branded new releases. Funded by Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey, the Chromatic has been available to preorder in six different color schemes from ModRetro since its June <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-pocket-competitor-tries-to-be-a-tribute-to-game-boy/1100-6523895/" data-ref-id="1100-6523895">reveal</a>, but now you can order a gray model from GameStop. You won't find the Chromatic at any other major retailer, as ModRetro partnered exclusively with GameStop.</p><p>The ModRetro Chromatic costs $199 and comes bundled with a new Tetris cartridge.

Though both handhelds are FPGA devices that will accurately replicate the performance of games on original hardware, they have different design philosophies. The Chromatic is dedicated to making you feel like you're playing your childhood Game Boy or Game Boy Color, while the Pocket takes a broader approach.</p><p>For example, the Chromatic's goal is to mimic the pixel structure and color accuracy of the GBC. It has a 2.6-inch screen has 160 x 144p resolution--the same specs as the Game Boy Color. But no need to feel bad for your eyes, as you will actually be able to see what's happening in your game without needing perfect lighting conditions or an accessory that unevenly illuminates your Game Boy. The Chromatic has a backlit IPS screen made of scratch-resistant, anti-glare glass.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Analogue Pocket has a 3.5-inch glass display with 1600 x 1440p resolution and 615 pixels per inch. It makes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review-the-best-way-to-play-game-boy-games/1100-6498917/" data-ref-id="1100-6498917">Game Boy, GBC, and GBA games look absolutely stunning</a> with Analogue's custom pixel perfect filter. You can change the filter to mimic specific Game Boy models, from the chunky DMG to GBC to the backlit GBA SP and more.</p><p>The Chromatic is strictly for Game Boy and GBC games, whereas the Pocket supports GB, GBC, <em>and</em> GBA out of the box, and adapters are sold separately for Game Gear, Atari Lynx, TurboGrafx-16, and Neo Geo Pocket Color carts. FPGA cores can be added via microSD, so you can play other platforms as well with a bit of tinkering. As a result of wider platform support, the Pocket has four face buttons and two triggers, whereas the Chromatic can get by with two face buttons and a D-pad.</p><p>Though we haven't had a chance to try the Chromatic, the build materials for the shell and buttons sound promising. Its buttons are made of PBT, a durable thermoplastic used for keycaps on high-end mechanical keyboards. The shell is made of magnesium alloy and shaped just like the original DMG Game Boy. Even the start and select buttons mirror the diagonal design of the Game Boy. ModRetro claims the case is "virtually indestructible," which could inspire some creative drop tests.</p><p>One pretty darn cool thing about the Chromatic is its battery versatility. It comes with three AA batteries and runs for 24 hours before you need to replace them. Rechargeable AA batteries are supported, too, and you can charge them via USB-C. If you don't want to deal with regular batteries of any kind, you'll also find a rechargeable lithium ion battery pack in the box.</p><p>Other notable features include video out for capturing gameplay on your PC, a link cable port for multiplayer, 3.5mm audio jack, and an IR sensor, which is used for select multiplayer features like receiving Mystery Gifts in Pokemon Gold and Silver. All multiplayer features are backwards compatible with original hardware.</p><p><strong>ModRetro Chromatic specifications</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Price</strong> - $199 for first edition bundle with Tetris cart</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Chromatic cartridges</li><li><strong>Display</strong> - Backlit 2.56-inch IPS LCD (sapphire crystal glass)</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong> - 160 x 144p</li><li><strong>Size</strong> - 5.2 x 3 x 1.2-inch, 6.2oz</li><li><strong>Shell</strong> - Magnesium alloy thixomolded shell</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong> - PBT face buttons and D-pad</li><li><strong>Battery</strong> - 24 hours with 3 AA batteries, lithium ion rechargeable battery pack</li><li><strong>Audio</strong> - internal speaker, 3.5mm headphones</li><li><strong>Ports</strong> - link cable, 3.5mm audio, USB-C with video out</li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - via backwards compatible link cable, IR sensor</li><li><strong>Colors</strong> - Gray (GameStop exclusive) | Six other colors available at ModRetro</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>If you don't have a Game Boy library, more <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" rel="nofollow ">Chromatic carts are available to purchase separately</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-campaign-length-explained.971382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-length/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While a single-player campaign certainly isn’t the focal point for a horde shooter, especially when it includes PvE and PvP game modes, it’s nice knowing you’ll get your money’s worth on all fronts. That said, here’s what we know about the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 campaign length!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-single-player-campaign-in-space-marine-2">How Long is the Single-Player Campaign in Space Marine 2?</h2>



<p>You certainly shouldn’t expect a massive campaign of epic proportions, but it’s a comfortable size for a weekend romp. It takes approximately<strong> 8-10 hours to finish the campaign</strong> in Space Marine 2 on standard difficulty settings. If you lower the difficulty, it may take less time. If you increase the difficulty, expect up to 12 or so hours to finish the story mode.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as you can play through the campaign cooperatively, having a human partner by your side instead of the AI should help you finish the main missions a little quicker.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-pve-missions-does-space-marine-2-include">How Many PvE Missions Does Space Marine 2 Include?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can expect approximately five to six PvE missions on launch, with more to come in the future, as per the studio’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year one roadmap</a>. Like in World War Z, PvE missions will likely be highly replayable in Space Marine 2. As you’ll want to unlock much of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-customization-details-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s cosmetics</a>, including weapons and armor skins, you’ll likely play through each mission repeatedly to score points or currency necessary to unlock equipment. That’s how things worked in World War Z.</p>



<p>Of course, alongside the campaign and PvE missions, there’s also the PvP game mode, which will extend the lifespan of the third-person action game for many. If PvP isn’t your thing, there’s nothing wrong with moving on to another game while waiting for more PvE missions to release!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-nintendo-switch-chargers-to-power-your-console.971343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-charger<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Nintendo Switch is the most popular console out there. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-nintendo-believes-the-og-switch-has-plenty-of-sales-left-in-it">Over 140 million units have been sold</a> to date worldwide, and the system is still pushing forward despite its age. With such a big presence in the market, there are naturally thousands of options to choose from when it comes to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories">Switch accessories</a>. That is especially true for chargers, as you cannot use your Nintendo Switch without one!</p><p>Whether you've just recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-times-to-buy-a-nintendo-switch">bought a Nintendo Switch</a> or recently lost the charger it came with, we've got you covered on which chargers are actually worth picking up. Whether you're constantly on the road or searching for something to use at home, check out our top picks for the best Nintendo Switch chargers below.</p><p id="best-overall"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Overall">1. Anker 67W USB-C Wall Charger</h2></p><h3>Best Overall Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="206651" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Anker 67W USB C Wall Charger</h3></p></div><p>The Anker 67W USB-C Wall Charger is our pick for the best overall Nintendo Switch charger. At 67W, this charger is capable of charging your Switch in both handheld and docked mode. You can use this with either mode, which isn't the case for other chargers on this list outside of the official Nintendo Switch AC Adapter. </p><p>A big benefit of the 67W is this charger's use beyond the Switch console. You can use this to charge an iPhone, MacBook, laptop, and more. This can be a life saver when traveling, as you'll only need one charger block. It's worth mentioning that you will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-usb-c-chargers-2024">need a USB-C cable</a> with this charger, as Anker does not provide one. </p><p id="best-official-charger"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Official Charger">2. Nintendo Switch AC Adapter</h2></p><h3>Best Official Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="206520" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch AC Adapter</h3></p><div><p>You can't go wrong with old reliable.</p></div></div>The Nintendo Switch AC Adapter is by far the best official charger for Nintendo Switch. This is the same exact charger that's bundled in with every Switch system, so it's easy to order a replacement if needed. Outputting at 39W, the Nintendo Switch AC Adapter connects to any 120V outlet with no issues.<p>Since the charger is made specifically for Nintendo Switch, you will never have to wonder or worry about a potential compatibility mismatch. Sometimes, using a third-party charger can hurt your charging port, or even brick your system if you aren't careful. Staying official when it comes to chargers is always recommended, with the exception of reputable and reliable third party brands like the ones we've listed here.</p><p id="best-portable-charger"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Portable Charger">3. Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank</h2></p><h3>Best Portable Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="195733" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank</h3></p><div><p>Top off your Switch with a 10,000mAh portable battery that straps onto it while offering a built-in USB-C and additional ports to charge other devices. </p></div></div>As outlined in our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best portable chargers</a>, the Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank is the best portable charger for Nintendo Switch. This device has the ability to directly clip on to the back of your system, so there's never any worry of a dangling cable tied to a power bank. While it adds some noticeable weight, the power bank is nowhere heavy enough to make long playing sessions uncomfortable.<p>The Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank features a 10,000mAh capacity with an output of 15W, which is perfect for charging your Nintendo Switch while in use or in rest mode. Based on the Nintendo Switch power draw, you should be able to get around 10 extra hours of playtime depending on the game, which is a significant increase from the built-in Switch battery.</p><p id="best-battery-case"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Battery Case">4. Newdery External Battery Station</h2></p><h3>Best Battery Case for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="181248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>NEWDERY External Battery Station</h3></p><div><p>This case has an integrated 10,000mAh battery to keep the Switch topped up without interfering with your gameplay. </p></div></div>The Newdery External Battery Station is our pick for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-battery-case">best battery case for Nintendo Switch</a>. This case provides a 10,000mAh battery in addition to the Switch's built-in battery, allowing for up to eight hours of additional playtime in handheld mode. If you're someone who exclusively plays in handheld mode or likes to travel, this can be an absolute game changer, especially when you're in the middle of an RPG like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.<p>Beyond battery life, the Newdery External Battery Station is simply comfortable to hold. The grip behind the Joy-Cons is extended, allowing for all players to be comfortable during long play sessions. Additionally, the case features a built-in kickstand, which reveals a compartment to store extra game cartridges on the go.</p><p id="best-car-charger"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Car Charger">5. PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger</h2></p><h3>Best Car Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="206591" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger</h3></p></div>The PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger is the ultimate charger if you're ready to break out your system on the road. First, the cable itself is braided, which is essential for use in a car. Plastic cables are often easily broken through regular wear and tear, but braided cables will last twice as long usually. Additionally, this product is officially licensed by Nintendo, meaning that you can trust the charger without worry of overvolting or damaging your system.<p>This cable is 6 feet long, which should be plenty to reach in either the passenger seat or backseat even. The 5V connector will plug into any 5V adapter, which is present on almost every single car manufactured. Whether you need to charge the Nintendo Switch itself or a <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-pro-controller">Pro Controller</a>, the PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger is perfect for a speedy charge in the car.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Charger FAQs</h2><h3>What type of charger works best for Switch?</h3><p>The regular and <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-oled-model">OLED Nintendo Switch model</a> draw <strong>a max of 18W of power at a time</strong>, while the Nintendo <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-lite">Switch Lite</a> draws 13.5W. While this is the limit of the system in handheld mode, the official Nintendo Switch charger included with the system allows for up to 39W of power draw. This is largely used when the system is docked or charging controllers through the USB ports. </p><p>As a result, the Nintendo Switch is unable to draw more than the wattage outlined above. This means that even if you use a 65W charger or above, your Switch will not draw more than the 18W it needs to charge. </p><h3>Do Joy-Cons need a separate charger?</h3><p>Fortunately, the Switch Joy-Cons do not need any charger to charge. They will receive power from the Nintendo Switch itself, which is charged through the USB-C port. So, you only need to purchase one charger for both the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-joy-cons">Joy-Con controllers</a> and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>It is important to note, though, that the Joy-Con can only be charged when attached to the side of the Nintendo Switch. These controllers do not have a USB-C port, therefore you cannot use a Switch charger to charge them. If you'd like to charge the Joy-Con when not attached to the Switch, you will need to purchase a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-gets-official-joy-con-charging-stand-over-7-years-after-launch">Joy-Con charging dock</a>.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

                <p>Later this fall, BioWare and EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-4-given-official-name-dragon-age-dreadwolf/1100-6504067/" data-ref-id="1100-6504067">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will finally give gamers a look at how the world of Thedas has changed in the decade since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> took place. But if the latest extended gameplay preview is any indication, Thedas hasn't been changed for the better. However, the storytelling of the game itself appears to be more refined.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-watch-22-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay-diving-into-exploration-and-more-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, The Veilguard co-directors Corinne Busche and John Epler hosted a 22-minute gameplay video that takes place deep into the story. In this side quest, the player character, Rook, agrees to help his companion, Davrin, complete a personal mission of revenge. The directors also pick up two additional side quests to procure medical supplies for the Grey Wardens and to locate a few of their missing members. This was meant to illustrate that these missions are more organically placed in the story, rather than unrelated events.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGMMK2I30-o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xGMMK2I30-o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, the Crossroads is no longer a place of refuge thanks to the war between the game's antagonist, Solas, and the gods. Rook and his companions have to fight their way through the area before they arrive at Hossberg, an area that has been overrun by the Blight.</p><p>Thanks to the Blight, the Darkspawn enemies are much more formidable in this preview, and Rook even perishes at one point before getting revived. The directors noted that they are giving the companions more autonomy in their character arcs, as demonstrated by Davrin separating himself from the player's party to go on ahead to confront his nemesis, the Gloom Howler.</p><p>Among the other details, faction shops--including the Grey Warden's--can be upgraded to give the players more enticing rewards. The areas are also designed to be revisited after the missions, if gamers are interested in searching for hidden secrets and treasures. </p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 31.</p>

Sea of Thieves: Sea Dog's Search released today, September 3, and is available for $14 (was $15) at Amazon.

            <p>
Battletech, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>, and The Lamplighters League developer Harebrained Schemes has announced its first project since parting ways with Paradox Interactive last year. It's a "post-cyberpunk survival horror RPG" called Graft and it's heading to PC.
</p>
<p>
Graft's story unfolds in the depths of a decaying continent-sized space station known as the Arc, home to forgotten technologies and unsettling wonders. Players must brave its horrors as they traverse "massive chasms, labyrinthine techno-catacombs, and self-replicating corridors", facing enemies in combat - including "ancient experiments, monstrous abominations, and relentless agents of a mad AI" - and Grafting as they go.
</p>
<p>
This is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, requiring players to scavenge body parts from fallen opponents and graft them onto themselves in order to alter their physical form, gaining new abilities and powers as they do. But Grafting a part also infuses players with its previous owner's memories, creating what Harebrained calls a "haunting interplay of survival, transformation, and self-discovery".

<p>
"Form alliances, build trust, and face the reality that anyone still living could be both an ally and a threat," teases the studio. "Your decisions will shape your journey and determine the fate of those you encounter...  Will you escape the Arc with your humanity intact, or become something else entirely?"
</p>
<p>
There's no hint of a release date for Graft, but Harebrained is currently aiming to launch it via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/graft-c7e6c4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">Steam</a>. It'll be the studio's first release since last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-lamplighters-league-review-rip-roaring-tactical-adventure-let-down-by-dreadful-real-time-stealth">flawed by entertaining</a> turn-based strategy game The Lamplighter's League, which publisher Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">later declared a $22m flop</a>.
</p>
<p>
That announcement was followed by the news Paradox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways</a> with Harebrained Schemes - which it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-acquires-battletech-developer-harebrained-schemes">acquired back in 2018</a> following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battletech">BattleTech</a> - with the publisher retaining the rights to The Lamplighters League, BattleTech, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a>, and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadowrun-trilogy">Shadowrun Trilogy</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shows-that-the-triple-a-pivot-to-live-service-was-always-doomed.971319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Concord</em>, the latest game in Sony’s ongoing live service salvo, came out a week and a half ago. Already, the writing was on the wall. There was no buzz. It just didn’t have the juice. Still, nobody was prepared for what happened today: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony announced</a> that it plans to pull the game from stores and offer refunds to anybody who bought it. <em>Concord </em>was smothered as it clambered out of the cradle – the ultimate object lesson in what happens when triple-A behemoths commit to live service for live service’s sake, despite the ever-increasing production demands of big-budget video games.</p><p><em>Concord </em>faltered for many reasons. Despite what the most irritatingly ill-informed people on the internet are saying, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1831005817702670526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diversity didn’t do it in</a>. Instead, eight years ago the game set off down what would become an impossible path, iterating on hero shooter concepts that were in vogue at the time and arriving looking polished but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feeling rusty</a>. In the time since <em>Concord </em>began development, <em>Overwatch </em>rose and fell, the battle royale boom redefined multiplayer shooters and petered out, extraction shooters became a thing, and an endless procession of competitive shooter hopefuls crashed and burned while a small handful – <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> among them – carved out enduring fiefdoms.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Concord </em>entered a massively competitive playing field feeling dated on day one, having to justify itself not just against other shooters, but popular live service games in general, whose audiences only tend to rove <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when their friends start sniffing at greener pastures</a>. This is why Sony’s plan to release 12 live service games by 2026 – which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23954006/sony-playstation-live-service-games-marathon-last-of-us-factions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got cut in half late last year</a> – never made much sense. Live-service games do not automatically print money. On the contrary, between regular upkeep and constant streams of new content, they are hugely costly, as <a href="https://x.com/cecianasta/status/1831050133439758576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even titans like <em>Roblox </em>can attest</a>. Attracting an audience – especially with no immediately-apparent hook beyond triple-A production values – is hard, and keeping it is even harder. Perhaps Sony imagined one or two smash live-service hits would ultimately balance out the odd miss here or there, but at this scale – with so many careers on the line – that’s an unconscionably risky gamble.&nbsp;</p><p>This is hardly a problem exclusive to competitive live-service games. <em>Starfield</em>, which shared a similarly lengthy incubation period to <em>Concord</em>, launched last year feeling like it emerged from a time capsule. <em>Suicide Squad</em>, which attempted to satisfy lovers of both traditional narrative-driven games and live-service grind-a-thons, only succeeded in <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letting everyone down</a>. Layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently followed</a>. The latter found itself clinging to the wreckage of basically the same Titanic as <em>Concord</em>: Beyond triple-A production values, it couldn’t justify its own existence.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, it’s little wonder why major video game publishers keep trying to squeeze blood from this particular stone. With triple-A games taking <a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more time, money, and manpower than ever to make</a>, they want the biggest, longest-lasting return on investment possible. But big publishers’ approach to live service is an unsustainable solution born of unsustainable development practices. The arms race to make bigger, longer games – with more <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impossibly-detailed hallways</a> that most players won’t even blink at – is a dead end. It has been all along. Papering over that with a business model that only <em>appears </em>to generate infinite revenue will not, in the overwhelming majority of cases, fix this fundamental problem. Most games in this mold will struggle to break even, and even the success stories will fall into <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the live-service death spiral</a>, a miasmatic pit of community toxicity that burns out developers and inspires reactive design decisions over anything truly inspired or forward thinking.</p><p>This is not to say that new live-service games cannot succeed; you just have to be creative about it in ways that big companies are loath to embrace. Most indies now launch ambitious, community-driven games in early access – <em>real </em>early access, where major features and chunks of content are missing, rather than money-grubbing “pre-order now!” early access that does not actually allow for feedback or substantial changes before release. Valve, which played a pioneering role in giving developers the tools to do this, is now taking cues from the scene it’s cultivated, stealth-dropping its own hero shooter, <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadlock</em></a>, in earlier-than-early access and attracting a sizable player base in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>But this approach is antithetical to major publishers’ addictions to secrecy and long lead times, as well as endless marketing drip feeds and elaborate pre-order bundles. Moreover, it still doesn’t address the elephant in the room: Big-budget game development is not sustainable, nor does it serve an apparent need. Games don’t have to be enormous; most players only experience a fraction of them. Triple-A fidelity has become a fool’s errand; <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games from more than a decade ago</a> still look great now. Developers at envelope-pushing studios like <em>Spider-Man</em> developer Insomniac <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not believe players notice</a> the fruits of billowing budgets -- at least, not enough to make the additional investment worthwhile.</p><p>It’s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-shorter-games-with-worse-graphics-and-im-not-kidding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cliche</a> to ask for shorter games with worse graphics, but I don’t think there’s any other <em>actual </em>solution to this problem. Triple-A games have become too costly, both in terms of money and a harder-to-measure though far more important human toll. As <em>Concord </em>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other games like <em>Destiny 2</em></a> have shown us, live service is not a silver bullet. In fact, it can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exacerbate these issues</a>. Every major release is now a potential catastrophe – a bomb waiting to go off, the fuse of which was lit the better part of a decade ago. The triple-A video game industry can’t go on like this. If it keeps blowing up its own foundations, it will destroy itself. Change is still possible, but as we’ve learned from <em>Concord</em>, it needed to happen yesterday. That’s no longer possible, so I guess we’ll have to settle for tomorrow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> has been in the works for quite some time, and it took a few years since its announcement to get a first proper look at the very first entry in a series of remakes that will allow players to experience the entirety of the Erdrick trilogy on modern gaming hardware. With the game right around the corner, Square Enix offered us a chance to try out the game during Gamescom in a short session that did not fail to show how the game is setting out to be among the best HD-2D games ever released.</p>
<p>The Gamescom 2024 demo threw players a few hours into the adventure into the town of Romaria, specifically in the Monster Arena, which has been overhauled for the remake to allow players to have a more active role in monster vs monster combat. Winning matches will provide the hero and his companions with some useful items, so I expect more than a few players will be spending quite a few hours here trying to get all the rewards.</p>
<p>Once I was done with my business at the Monster Arena, I had the chance to explore the town of Romaria, and speak with the king, who enlists the hero to recover his crown from the thieves that stole it. After accepting the task, I explored the town a little more, stocking on supplies, purchasing better weapons and gear for my party members, and appreciating the excellent recreation of the town in the HD-2D style. The game as a whole looked lively and positively vibrant, especially on the Nintendo Switch OLED, where the colors really looked incredible.</p>

<p>Despite having accepted the request of the king, I decided to wander around and see what else the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake demo had to offer. I ended up exploring a few dungeons briefly in the surroundings of Romaria and fighting against a few enemies. The original game's turn-based combat system has been left virtually untouched, though now the characters appear on screen when choosing commands. Some welcome additions include the ability to speed up combat, which is sure to help the game's pacing considerably, though I found the encounter rate to be fair, for the most part, and the ability to set up tactics and change auto-battle settings, which should make random encounters even faster to complete. As one of my party members came with the new Monster Wrangler vocation, I was able to briefly try some of its abilities out, and it felt powerful enough. Difficulty, in general, was on the low side, but that was most likely caused by the leveled-up characters that were provided for the demo. The final game will feature multiple difficulty settings, so players will easily be able to tailor the general difficulty level to their skill level.</p>
<p>Having only played through Dragon Quest III years ago, I really can't say if there have been big changes to locations, treasure chest locations, and the like in the remake, but even so, it is undeniable that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is likely going to set a new bar for faithful remakes of classic JRPGs. Thankfully, it won't take much longer to be able to delve deeper into the story of Ortega and his child, as the game launches in just a few months, on November 14th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>
