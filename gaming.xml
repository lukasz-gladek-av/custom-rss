<p>When you first dive into a horde shooter, you want that overwhelming feeling of power. You play on one of the lowest difficulty settings to crush every foe in your path. But as you learn the maps and mechanics, you find brushing off enemies easy, and you want more of a challenge. That’s when you ramp up the difficulty. To help you decide where to start, here’s a look at the campaign difficulty modes in Space Marine 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-difficulty-modes-in-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">All Difficulty Modes in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 includes four campaign difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Veteran, and Angel of Death. Saber Interactive is planning a fifth, more challenging difficulty level for some time during year one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per its roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a simple, straightforward experience, I recommend starting on Easy. It’s a fantastic time, and you genuinely feel powerful. But if you want a slight challenge while still feeling like an Ultramarine, Normal is an excellent starting point. That said, the game does recommend Veteran. I don’t. Especially for new players, it’s a bit much to handle at first.</p>



<h3 id="h-easy-mode">Easy Mode</h3>

<ul>
<li>Balanced for a better story experience</li>



<li>Enemies are less aggressive</li>



<li>Health and Armour are greatly increased</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-normal-mode">Normal Mode</h3>

<ul>
<li>Presents a fair gameplay challenge</li>



<li>Enemies are moderately aggressive</li>



<li>Resources need to be managed wisely</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-veteran-mode">Veteran Mode</h3>

<ul>
<li>Set up as the intended experience</li>



<li>Enemies are dangerous</li>



<li>Tactical and skillful play is rewarded</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-angel-of-death-mode">Angel of Death Mode</h3>

<ul>
<li>Introduces serious challenge</li>



<li>Enemies are tougher and more aggressive</li>



<li>Recovery after mistakes is much harder</li>
</ul>



<p>All of the game’s difficulty modes alter the amount of armour you start with, making recovering from combat encounters either a breeze or an absolute hair-pulling experience. In time, as you learn the game’s dodge and parry mechanics, however, you will find that increasing the difficulty to Veteran or Angel of Death becomes a must!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-change-difficulty-modes-in-space-marine-2">How to Change Difficulty Modes in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>When you start a new game in Space Marine 2, you can select the game’s difficulty before stepping into Titus’ boots. But once you’re on the Battlebarge, you can still increase or lower the campaign difficulty. </p>



<p>Walk up to the terminal near the dropship, right to the left-hand side on top of the staircase leading to the launch platform. Here, you can interact with the terminal to select any one of the difficulty levels. You can also swap between Campaign, Operations, and Ground War (PvP) at this very same terminal!</p>

<p>Bloober Team wants to bring you back to the 90s. When the Silent Hill 2 remake launches in October, the developers are giving players a way to increase the overall immersion of the game.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/1831331608302907651">social media</a> on Wednesday, the developers announced that players will have the option to turn off all UI elements within the game. In addition to that, they have created a “90s filter” for players to add on to it.</p>



<p>“We’ve also created a “90s filter” with grain effect, color correction and screen adjustments to complete the old-school experience,” Bloober Team said while showing off an example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the original Silent Hill 2 launched in 2001, the first game in the series launched in 1999 and was developed in the late 90s. So, adding a 90s filter to the game isn’t all that ridiculous.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 launches on October 8 for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

Black Ops 6 features the most advanced movement of any boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty, with fast and fluid omnidirectional movement.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical layout is recommended for those using a standard controller, as it maps your crouch/slide/dive button to the thumbstick, so you can be quick without ever needing to move your thumb. If you have something like a Scuf or another controller that lets you remap your buttons, you can just leave this on its default setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger Effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5. The immersion might feel cool, but for more precise aiming, you want to have this effect turned off.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deadzone">Deadzone</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362006" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362006"></a><figcaption>BO6 dead zone setting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deadzone Inputs:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">L2 Button: 0.0</li><li dir="ltr">R2 Button: 0.0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stick drift varies for each player's controller. Thankfully, Black Ops 6 keeps Modern Warfare 3's helpful feature for testing the deadzones on your controller, and it's found right here inside the settings.</p><p dir="ltr">First, start on the default Deadzone settings, then turn on the Test Stick Deadzone setting. This test will give you numbers on the bottom of the left and right stick images. Whatever numbers it gives you, you want to adjust the minimum stick drift number for that specific stick to go at least one number higher than the number you're given.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: If your left stick test shows a 3 and the right stick shows a 2, you want to adjust the minimum drift for the left stick to a 4 and the right stick to a 3. Then test again to make sure you don't have any more drift.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, you'll want L2/R2 set to 0.0 to make sure you're getting instant activation.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Aiming">Aiming</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sensitivity Multiplier:  <ul><li dir="ltr">Ground vehicle sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Air scorestreak sensitivity multiplier: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Tablet sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Sens.

You might want to keep the sprint assist setting off to play a bit slower and more tactical, but for me, I found that it gave me much more fluid movement, and it required fewer button inputs to get sprinting into action and make use of the omnidirectional movement. As an added bonus, it makes for less wear on your hands and your thumbsticks as well.</p><p dir="ltr">You might even like the mantle assistance on, but for me personally, I found I was often mantling at awkward times when I would prefer to just stand behind the cover. This setting will definitely keep you moving, but it seems like it is more likely to put you at a disadvantage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Movement_behaviors">Movement behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Automatic airborne mantle: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Slide/Dive behavior: Tap to slide</li><li dir="ltr">Auto door peek: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Advanced_movement_behaviors">Advanced movement behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sprint/Tactical sprint behavior: Toggle</li><li dir="ltr">Auto move forward: Single tap</li><li dir="ltr">Sprint restore: On</li><li dir="ltr">Slide maintains sprint: On</li><li dir="ltr">Tactical sprint behavior: Single tap sprint</li><li dir="ltr">Plunging underwater: Trigger</li><li dir="ltr">Sprinting door bash: On</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Vehicle_behaviors">Vehicle behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Vehicle camera recenter: Short delay</li><li dir="ltr">Camera initial position: Free look</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combat_behaviors">Combat behaviors</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362008-combatbehaviors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362008" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362008-combatbehaviors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362008"></a><figcaption>Combat behavior settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362008-combatbehaviors.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr">Aim down sight behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount activation: ADS + melee</li><li dir="ltr">Quick C4 detonation: Grouped</li><li dir="ltr">Equipment behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Manual fire behavior: Press</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Advanced_combat_behaviors">Advanced combat behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Change up directional behavior: Ping</li><li dir="ltr">Change zoom activation: Sprint/Tactical Sprint/Focus</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount exit: Short Delay</li><li dir="ltr">Interact/reload behavior: Prioritize reload</li><li dir="ltr">Sprint cancels reload: Off</li><li dir="ltr">ADS stick swap: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Depleted ammo weapon switch: On</li><li dir="ltr">Scorestreak reordering: Numerical order</li><li dir="ltr">Dedicated melee weapon behavior: Hold melee</li><li dir="ltr">Swap body shield and execution behavior: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Overlay_behaviors">Overlay behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Ping wheel delay: Moderate</li><li dir="ltr">Double tap ping wheel delay: Moderate</li><li dir="ltr">Wheels behavior: Hold</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_graphics_settings_for_console">Best graphics settings for console</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Display">Display</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">120 HZ refresh rate (If applicable): On</li><li dir="ltr">Safe area: Adjust to your specific monitor/TV</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Eco mode preset: Efficiency</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Post_processing_effects">Post processing effects</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362010-postprocessingeffects.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362010" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362010-postprocessingeffects.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362010"></a><figcaption>Post processing effects</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362010-postprocessingeffects.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr">World motion blur: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon motion blur: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Depth of Field: Off</li><li dir="ltr">FIDELITYFZ CAS: On</li><li dir="ltr">FIDELITYFZ CAS Strength: Choose somewhere between 50 - 80</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="View">View</h3><p dir="ltr">Accessibility solutions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Motion reduction: On/off is personal preference</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For the motion reduction setting, I personally use this because I'm sensitive to motion sickness.

			<p>The new season of <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/">Rocket League</a> went live today, and ancient folklore is present in the game. Players will get to explore a brand-new arena called Drift Woods. As you are competing against other players, you may find yourself sighting the Chupacabra or even an appearance of Mothman.</p>
<p>Season 16 will give you access to new cars such as the BMW 1 Series, which you can unlock automatically by purchasing the Rocket League Season 16 Rocket Pass Premium. This will give you access to the BMW 1 Series RLE Car Body, the Chupacabra Topper, Sasquatch Print Wheels, and a Mothman Decal as you scale up the Season 16 Rocket Pass Premium tiers.</p>
<p>You can also obtain a Mothman Antenna, Darker Disc Wheels and a Ghoulpost Antenna, if you want to get into the Halloween spirit ahead of time. There are over 70 Tiers to unlock across the Free and Premium tracks, meaning those who aren't purchasing the Premium pass will still get some cool rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rocket League Season 16 - Urban Legends Emerge from the Arena’s Darkest Depths" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0qrGEG4pog?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as the cosmetic rewards, players can expect to hear some new music on the Rocket League Radio, with a new song to represent Season 16 titled "Lie." This song has been produced by Mr. Bill &amp; Culprate and will be available on the Rocket League Radio. It will appear in the Featured Shop as a Player Anthem.</p>
<p>One important note that was added to the blog post announcing Season 16 of Rocket League is that the BMW 1 Series and BMW 1 Series RLE car bodies both use the Octane hitboxes, meaning that these car bodies will be eligible for cross-game ownership between Rocket League and Fortnite.</p>
<p>The post-demolition camera is one of the most important features added to Rocket League season 16. It's a more seamless transition with improved tracking that shows precisely where you are in the arena and where you will respawn afterward. The latest season of Rocket League has already started and will continue until December 4, 2024.</p>
<p>During this season, players will also see and participate in the available Competitive Tournaments for both Soccar and Heatseeker, depending on your preferred game mode. There are 32 teams in total, and to accommodate players in South Africa, players can participate in weekend tournaments.</p>
<p>You will be rewarded for your efforts if you successfully climb up the ranks during the Competitive Tournament. This includes rewards such as the Bateye Topper, the Gnaw'd Wheels, and the Rocketmancer Goal Explosion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-16-urban-legends-emerge-from-the-arenas-darkest-depths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the official Rocket League website explains the Competitive Tournament schedule slots in more detail so those who want to compete can find out when they can expect to be online and available to play Rocket League.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> is a Bandai Namco-developed anime MMO which released in Japan last year, and was meant to arrive in the west at some point this year courtesy of Amazon Games. Alas, that's no longer the case - and the game is also shutting down in Japan early next year.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, Bandai Namco Online announced that they have made the difficult decision to end service on Blue Protocol. They will shut down their Japanese Blue Protocol servers in January 2025, and have ended plans to release the game in the West in collaboration with Amazon Games," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139230/view/4244166473681846926">the announcement from last week</a>.
</p>
<p>The Japanese servers will be shut down on January 18th, 2025. As of today, the game has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139230/BLUE_PROTOCOL/">delisted from Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Outwardly, Blue Protocol seemed to be following closely in the footsteps of Genshin Impact, with a world of blue skies, green grass, and Breath Of The Wild-style enemies to bash through action-RPG combat. Ed wasn't sure there was anything more to it beyond that when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-protocol-seems-like-a-slick-anime-mmo-if-an-extremely-predictable-one">he had a chance to play it last year</a>, calling it predictable, describing its world as "eh", and fretting over the inevitable microtransactions.
</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame we won't get a chance at a proper play of it - and even more so that it's shutting down for those players who were already invested. Bandai Namco say that they're not offering refunds for players who already spent real money on in-game Rose Orbs currency, but they'll be handing out 5000 free Rose Orbs every month between now and January for players to spend on in-game cosmetics. That sucks.
</p>
<p>There's apparently still some new contnet to come to the Japanese version of the game before it closes down, and its developers have <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/506">put together a schedule for the remaining months here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So while the upcoming <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is going to recap his history when it comes out on October 25, I thought I’d break down who the black-and-red hedgehog is and why every blue blur stan you know is freaking out about his appearance in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-recommend-id="image://98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="819" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow standing on his motorcycle like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow standing on his motorcycle like a cool guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-recommend-id="image://98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="819" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow standing on his motorcycle like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No, Shadow is not a cliched “evil” Sonic variant. The antihero debuted in 2001 in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, a Dreamcast game all about playing two different sides of the same conflict. The story was divided into two sides: Hero and Dark. The first followed Sonic and his friends Tails and Knuckles, while the second followed series antagonist Doctor Eggman, Shadow, and a treasure-hunting government double agent, Rouge the Bat. A lot of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wYhPrZIP3HA?si=50bNI047peZZQpUA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wYhPrZIP3HA?si=50bNI047peZZQpUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sega’s marketing</a></span> played up Sonic and Shadow’s juxtaposition as a good, angelic hedgehog and an evil, devious foe, and it’s true, Shadow does team up with Eggman, claiming to help him achieve his dream of world domination. But that’s just who he appears on the surface. Shadow’s actual motivations are revealed as the Dark-side story goes on, and there’s a much more tragic, multifaceted character at the center.</p><p>Shadow was created 50 years prior to the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>by Doctor Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather. He was born in a space station floating above Earth called Space Colony Ark. Here, Robotnik was researching immortality in an effort to find a cure for his granddaughter Maria’s terminal illness. Shadow was designed to be the “Ultimate Life Form,” capable of withstanding any disease or injury, with his immortal nature hopefully one day transferred into humans like Maria. The young girl lived with her grandfather on the space station, and as a result became close friends with Shadow as Robotnik continued his research. The two would look down on Earth and dream of seeing it together one day when Maria was cured of her condition.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-recommend-id="image://712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1487" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-recommend-id="image://712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1487" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Robotnik’s research was being funded by the United Federation (the <em>Sonic </em>equivalent of the United States). It was initially conceived as a means to create a living weapon, though Robotnik’s personal motivation was to save Maria. During his research, Robotnik created two immortal beings: Shadow, and a giant reptilian prototype called the Biolizard. Unlike Shadow, the Biolizard was violent and uncontrollable, and once the United Federation caught wind of it, the decision was made to shut down the project and eliminate anyone who knew of it. A squad of G.U.N. (Guardian Unit of Nations) soldiers were deployed onto the station, arresting Robotnik, killing researchers, and evacuating civilians. However, one civilian was caught in the crossfire: Maria.</p><p>Different versions of Shadow’s story across the games and extended universe depict Maria’s death differently. The 2005 game <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>shows a G.U.N. soldier shoot her in cold blood, while the <em>Sonic X </em>anime shows him kill her when she refuses to comply with his orders. What was she doing that they found so objectionable? She was sending Shadow to Earth in order to save him from the slaughter.</p><p>With her dying breath, she asks Shadow to bring hope to humanity as he is sent down to Earth on an escape pod. You’d think that wish would have led to Shadow saving the world rather than attempting to destroy it. So what happened?</p><p>As is revealed throughout <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Robotnik went mad after the loss of Maria and his research. Even while imprisoned by G.U.N. and continuing his work under heavier supervision, the doctor began planning his revenge. If he couldn’t save Maria, he would destroy the humans who took everything away from him. This included brainwashing Shadow to forget Maria’s dying wish, instead having him misremember it as her asking him for revenge.</p><p>Shadow was eventually captured by G.U.N. and put into stasis, where he would remain for 50 years. Finally awoken by Eggman all those years later, he manipulated the doctor into bringing all seven Chaos Emeralds to the remnants of Space Colony Ark, claiming he wanted to use the stones’ energy to power the station’s powerful Eclipse Cannon and threaten the people of Earth into submission. But in truth, his plan was to use the emeralds to put the station on a collision course with the planet, destroying it and all of humanity.</p><p>Shadow nearly succeeded, too, before being reminded of Maria’s true dying wish by Sonic’s not-girlfriend Amy Rose. He then joined the rest of our heroes in stopping the Ark’s descent by using the Chaos Emeralds to defeat the Biolizard who was sprung from its imprisonment in the depths of the station. Then, having used all his power to stabilize the Ark, he fell to Earth. The rest of our heroes mourned him, but celebrated that he was able to carry out Maria’s wish.</p></div></div><div><p>That was the plan. Shadow was intended to be a one-and-done antihero with a heart of gold and a full circle redemption story. If that had been the extent of his story, it would have been a pretty powerful note to end on. However, because fans latched onto him, Sega decided to bring him back in 2003’s <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, but it wasn’t entirely clear if we were playing as the same character, or an imitation. It’s here that Shadow’s story became much, much more convoluted as <em>Sonic </em>started to go back to the well on this guy again and again.</p><p>In <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, Shadow appears as a member of Team Dark. This group is founded by Rouge, who stumbles upon Shadow in a containment pod in one of Eggman’s secret bases. The hedgehog seems to have lost his memories and is under the watchful guard of one of the doctor’s robots named E-123 Omega, and the three team up to find the scientist and demand answers. <em>Sonic Heroes </em>raises more questions about Shadow than it answers, as the group stumbles upon lifelike Shadow androids. Rouge finds an entire lab full of these robots in stasis, and confides in Omega that she believes the Shadow they’ve been fighting alongside to be a robot like the others. Omega points out that if Eggman has cloned Shadow, the original must exist somewhere. However, it wasn’t until Shadow’s 2005 game that the <em>Sonic </em>series would make a definitive statement on the matter.</p></div><div><p><em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, the 2005 game starring Shadow as the sole playable character, is a complicated web of stories to unpack. The platformer is choice-based, allowing you to see different stories unfold based on which missions you complete in each level. If I kill a bunch of bad guys, I can see Shadow go down a heroic path. If I sabotage Sonic and friends, I can watch him revert to his villainous ways. All of these are portrayed as “what if” scenarios, but the game does tell us a lot more about how Shadow came to be.</p><p>In between all the alternate histories, it’s revealed that while creating Shadow, Robotnik sought the help of an alien race called the Black Arms. These invaders occupy a comet that passes over Earth every 50 years or so, and plan to return to the planet in a few decades to impose themselves on humanity. Robotnik made a deal with the aliens to further his research, offering to have Shadow help with the invasion in exchange for the DNA of Black Doom, the aliens’ leader. Shadow’s memories are still gone, but Robotnik left a video message from before the raid on the Ark with instructions for Shadow to use the Eclipse Cannon to destroy the Black Arms’ comet and save the world. Shadow faces Black Doom in a final fight, then blows up the comet from orbit. He then makes the decision to leave his past behind and determine his own future…but not before Eggman confirms that he is, in fact, the original Ultimate Life Form, whom he rescued after the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Wildly enough, this confirmation only comes if you take over eight minutes to complete the final boss battle, so plenty of players never hear this voice line from Eggman.</p></div><div><p>Look, it wasn’t his finest hour. But, yes, Shadow did use firearms in the 2005 game, and swore when he took damage. He also started riding vehicles like motorcycles when it would have been faster for him to run. In the years since, the vehicles have stuck, as he used them again in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</em> and is seen riding a motorcycle in the first trailer for <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. The swearing and guns? Less so. Earlier this year, Sega <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-the-hedgehog-guns-vehicles-1851530228&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-the-hedgehog-guns-vehicles-1851530228">gave some conflicting reasons</a></span> for why Shadow put down the glock, claiming that he used guns out of necessity, but also that he doesn’t need weapons because he’s a living one. Look Sega, just say it was a different time and you were trying to appeal to different, edgier markets. Not everything has to be lore.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-recommend-id="image://9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-format="jpg" data-width="2016" data-height="1130" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow race down the side of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow race down the side of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-recommend-id="image://9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-format="jpg" data-width="2016" data-height="1130" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow race down the side of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Up to this point, it hasn’t been confirmed why Robotnik made his Ultimate Life Form a hedgehog. Shadow’s resemblance to the blue blur has gotten Sonic into some trouble, however, as the government mistook Shadow for the hero during his life of crime. For now, the predominant theory is that Shadow may be based on a prophetic mural depicting Sonic’s future that appears <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1appdh1/shadows_origins_in_the_movie/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1appdh1/shadows_origins_in_the_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Angel Island</a></span>, but that’s just a theory. Fans are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1799314859202408858?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1799314859202408858?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speculating that <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>may end up confirming this</a></span>, based on images of Robotnik’s journal included with physical copies of the game.<br></p></div><div><p>Yes, but Shadow’s appearance in <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a bit more significant than that. For a few years, Shadow was one of the faces of the franchise, and came second only to Sonic in character popularity polls. His story was complex, his character intriguing, and he was an excellent foil to Sonic’s happy-go-lucky attitude. Following <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, Sega made a concerted effort to pull back on the ensemble cast in favor of going back to basics. Sonic was the only playable character for most games, the stories became more simple, and everyone was sanded down to a few distinct traits, with Shadow being solely defined by broodiness and hating the company of others, despite making some really excellent strides in accepting the companionship of the rest of Team Dark in <em>‘06</em>.</p><p><br>For nearly 20 years, Shadow has swayed in the background as a caricature of himself, and Sega has taken its time putting him back in the spotlight. He made brief appearances in <em>Sonic Forces</em> as a DLC character and had a bit part in the <em>Sonic Boom</em> subseries, so Sega has been gradually nudging him back into the public consciousness. But what we’re seeing in <em>Sonic 3 </em>seems to be leaning toward a version of him that we haven’t seen in years. Shadow the Hedgehog deserves more than being remembered as a misanthropic edgelord who said “damn” and used a gun one time. It seems like Sega, and hopefully the rest of the world, is finally coming around to that fact. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony doesn’t think it has enough original intellectual property (IP).</p>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/307f7a2e-a755-4f6e-badc-9bc119f185df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> (h/t to <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/09/04/playstation-doesnt-have-enough-ip-says-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Lifestyle</a> for spotting it), Sony chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki said that the company needs to put more of a focus in creating its own IP moving forward. And that’s not just in a specific sector, but throughout the company.</p>



<p>“Whether it’s for games, films or anime, we don’t have that much IP that we fostered from the beginning,” he said. “We’re lacking the early phase (of IP) and that’s an issue for us.”</p>



<p>Hotoki added in the interview that Sony has been “better at finding a global audience for content that have already become popular in their home market.”</p>



<p>From a gaming standpoint, Sony has a number of original active IPs for PlayStation. Franchises such as God of War, Horizon, Uncharted continue to be successful from Sony first-party developers. The company also has a number of dormant first-party titles like Bloodborne (which Sony funded at FromSoftware), Killzone, SOCOM, Resistance, and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a massive in-game event: one that will allow players to get new, modernized versions of the game's iconic Tier 2 armor sets.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas WoW anniversary events in the past have run for a few weeks in November, the 20th anniversary event is the star of the game's 11.0.5 update and will run for over two months. That's good news, because the event is chock-full of new activities and rewards that look to celebrate 30 years of Warcraft as a franchise and 20 years of Blizzard's MMORPG.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNeQdGV5_2U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MNeQdGV5_2U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The biggest prize players will want to seek out are the updated Tier 2 armor sets. Originally found in the vanilla version of WoW, the sets for each of the game's original nine classes are still some of the most iconic armor sets in the game: the gold standard by which all of its subsequent tier sets are measured. Blizzard is giving each of them a visual upgrade for the anniversary event to look more in-line with the game's modern visuals. For classes that didn't exist back when Tier 2 was originally available--Death Knights, Monks, Demon Hunters, and Evokers--Blizzard is introducing all-new sets inspired by WoW's early days.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what new activities will be available during the event, Blizzard is looking back to some of WoW's most iconic dungeons and raids for inspiration. Blackrock Depths is coming back as a raid, for starters, and Blizzard is looking to capture the spirit of the game's iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-players-quest-to-become-scarab-lord-highlights-what-makes-the-games-aq-event-so-special/1100-6501029/" data-ref-id="1100-6501029">Gates of Ahn'Qiraj</a> event with new outdoor activities in Silithus. The anniversary update will also see a handful of original WoW dungeons get the Timewalking treatment, allowing players to venture into iconic dungeons like the Deadmines, Zul'farrak, Dire Maul, and Stratholme to earn updated rewards. For PvP enjoyers, the Korrak's Revenge brawl is coming back once more as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Participating in the new activities, as well as Season 1 content (which will still be in full swing by the time the anniversary update arrives) will earn players a new currency. That currency can be used to buy the aforementioned Tier 2 armor sets as well as new mounts, pets, and other cosmetics, including a set modeled off Blizzard's real-life service rewards granted to longtime Blizzard employees. A fairgrounds of sorts for the event will be set up outside the game's Caverns of Time location, where players can enjoy other festivities like dressing up as iconic WoW characters, listening to stories from WoW's past as told by Lorewalker Cho, or a new Mount Mania minigame where players will be able to show off their mount collection.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the event itself, patch 11.0.5 will allow Dracythr players, until now restricted to being the Dracthyr-exclusive Evoker class, the option of being some, but not all, of the game's other classes. Dracthyr will be able to play as Rogue, Warlock, Hunter, Priest, Mage, and Warrior come the update. Shamans will also see an update to their Ascended forms that channel the various elements that Shamans wield in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't announced a release date for WoW's 11.0.5 patch just yet, but said it will be available for testing on the game's public test realm soon. Previous anniversary events have happened in November, so expect the update to arrive somewhere around that time. Meanwhile, WoW's latest expansion, The War Within, just launched. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review-stay-awhile-and-listen/1900-6418275/" data-ref-id="1900-6418275">WoW: The War Within review</a>, we called the MMO's 10th expansion one of its best. WoW: The War Within Season 1, which introduces the expansion's first raid and kicks off its Mythic+ dungeon and PvP seasons, begins September 10.</p>

					<p>I thought Dragonflight was the absolute peak of modern-day World of Warcraft, but I didn't think it could be topped. At first, I didn't have much hope for <a href="https://thewarwithin.blizzard.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The War Within</a> when diving into it. However, the action started immediately, and my interest was immediately piqued. While World of Warcraft has had some questionable choices in villains (looking at The Jailer from Shadowlands), Xal'atath feels multi-faceted and genuinely evil compared to other villains that have popped up over the years.</p>
<p>The Warbands feature was one of the best features added in this new expansion. You could choose up to four characters in a Warband, regardless of race, class, or faction. By having those four in the Warband, you could transfer supplies between them, including currencies, appearances, Renown levels, and achievements! With the Warbands feature came the feature of learning a transmog appearance, regardless of whether you could equip that type of armor or weapon, making the potential to get great transmogs even easier.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this feature did break the Guild bank, with my guild, in particular, losing a ridiculous amount of supplies and materials. Many mounts were in there for players to get if they didn't already own them. There is no update on whether Blizzard will resolve that, and neither my guild nor I am hopeful about this situation.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about getting stuck into World of Warcraft: The War Within was how Alliance tailored it felt. Although I play as a Blood Elf Arcane Mage, I immediately noticed that the main characters I interacted with were all Alliance except for Thrall, who is part of the Alliance, and Horde. I went into this expansion without knowing anything about it other than that it centered more heavily around the Void, which I was incredibly excited about. Since Void Elves were introduced in World of Warcraft: Legion, I have loved everything to do with the Void and was excited to see it come back to life in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-launch-qa-on-dungeons-raids-and-art/">new expansion</a>.</p>
<p>While the action started brilliantly, I was shocked to see it take such a turn and for them to kill off a main character so soon into the expansion. I'd barely done five quests before seeing the cutscene, and it still feels like a questionable choice. Whether it was done to get rid of a powerful character or to get back at Alleria is something that I'm still figuring out.</p>
<p>The new areas we are introduced to in The War Within are stunning. Khaz Algar and the surrounding areas are incredibly tranquil and feel like something out of Middle Earth. Pair that with the accompanying music, and completing side quests or working on your professions is very peaceful. I usually spend a lot of time completing the surrounding side quests and grinding reputations, and I found the daily quests and world quests enjoyable, as well as some of the mount and pet farms available.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-6.png"></a></figure>

<p>Compared to previous expansions, I was thoroughly impressed with how well the expansion seemed optimized from the outset. During all the last expansion releases I've experienced, servers have been packed, or immense lag has made it difficult to get anything done. This time, the expansion seems to be running like a well-oiled machine, with barely any hiccups along the way.</p>
<p>My main gripe with The War Within is now from an update Blizzard pushed a couple of days ago, making the enemies more challenging to deal with overall. I could initially take care of a pack of five basic enemies alone, but I had to heal and use all defensive cooldowns to deal with just one. Even Delves have become pretty much impossible, even at the lower levels. Regardless of whether you set Brann Bronzebeard up to be in a healer role or a DPS role, his attacks and abilities aren't of much use to you at all.</p>
<p>I find that he's of more value as a damage dealer. Although he drops potions in the healer role, it feels as if the potions don't actually provide any healing whatsoever, and now Delves will only be possible if you are overgeared, which won't be able to happen for a while yet.</p>
<p>Once I get some new gear for my Arcane Mage and max out my Hero Talents, I'll enjoy the challenge of Delves again without dying before completing the first mission. I enjoy being a glass cannon class as my rotation is simple and fun, and I hope I don't have to swap to my Paladin just to be able to progress and complete the Delves entirely.</p>
<p>Compared to some previous expansions, the story for World of Warcraft: The War Within is very well thought out. It's been fantastic to see characters such as Alleria again, bringing hidden characters back into the limelight after not being seen for multiple expansions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-8.png"></a></figure>

<p>Each area throughout Khaz Algar felt unique, with their features that made them stand out from each other. For example, Dornogal is very peaceful, and you can have a great time while leveling professions there. In contrast, the atmosphere in Hallowfall is very different, with far more tension than the other areas in the expansion.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've found the dungeons to be a little bit samey. They remind me of multiple expansions in the past, specifically Warlords of Draenor and Cataclysm. The dungeons feel inspired by other dungeons from previous expansions, with Priory of the Sacred Flame reminiscent of a dungeon from Shadowlands.</p>
<p>Although there is now the addition of collecting Skyriding Glyphs in the latest expansion, despite collecting a massive amount of them, it seems bizarre to me that the point of these Skyriding Glyphs is to provide the players with a new mount. They served a purpose in Dragonflight, as they offered your Dragon abilities during flight. I like that they were reincorporated into this new expansion, but I feel that it could have been built upon rather than just being used to provide players with a new mount grind.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing what the first season of this expansion brings and seeing my Arcane Mage become more powerful with some better gear, especially with the addition of Hero Talents, which have revolutionized my gameplay as an Arcane Mage. Nothing is quite as cool as summoning your own Arcane Phoenix (even if it can sometimes be a bit temperamental.)</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-7.png"></a></figure>

<p>As someone who has always played the weakest spec of Mage in World of Warcraft, it's been fantastic seeing the Arcane Mage thrive and finally have a spot on the DPS charts. This has been boosted substantially by the Hero Talents, which, as stated above, can give you awesome abilities like summoning an Arcane Phoenix when using Arcane Surge. Depending on what stats you spec into, your Arcane Phoenix can even help with interrupts, utilizing its own Spellsteal.</p>
<p>Interacting with the Earthens and getting to know Magni and his family has been a highlight of the expansion. I wasn't expecting Magni ever to be freed from the curse set upon him by Azeroth, and it was a complete shock to the system to see him as a normal Dwarf rather than one made of stone.</p>
<p>Overall, World of Warcraft: The War Within has been a delight to experience, from fun and rewarding mount grinds to surprisingly adorable pets (looking at you, Oop'lajax), as well as some genuinely heartbreaking quests that you get to experience in the main story campaign. Admittedly, I ignored the main campaign for quite a while and decided to do many of the side quests and Skyriding Glyph collecting, but even then, I had fun at every interval. I can't wait to sink even more hours into World of Warcraft: The War Within and I look forward to seeing what comes next in future updates.</p>

<p>The expansion was so close to perfect. If it wasn't for the update that Blizzard released where they went from undertuning everything to overtuning it, the expansion would have been perfection. The quests are fun, Hero Talents provide lots of cool options, and the music really makes the areas of Khaz Algar magical and threatening, all at the same time. Admittedly, the story for this expansion could have done with being a little longer, as it felt quite short overall compared to previous expansions. However, there is still time for them to add more in future patches.</p>

            <p>Paradox are integrating four of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis IV</a>'s DLCs into the base game. The Rights Of Man, Art Of War, Digital Extreme Upgrade and Common Sense DLCs will be free to all current and future players of the eleven-year-old grand strategy game from October 17th onwards. 
</p>
<p>On the same date, Paradox are also introducing a new Starter Edition of the game and lowering the price of the its Ultimate Bundle DLC collection.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are happy to announce the integration of FOUR essential DLCs into the Europa Universalis IV base game: 'Rights of Man', 'Art of War', 'Digital Extreme Upgrade' and 'Common Sense'. That’s right - all current and future EUIV players will receive these four DLCs absolutely free of charge! And you won’t even need to do anything to receive them," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>Three of the above DLC - Digital Extreme Upgrade, Art Of War and Rights Of Man - are already a part of the current Starter Edition, which typically costs £7 more than the base game itself. Common Sense - which, my parents will tell you, I don't possess - would typically be an extra £12.79 on top.
</p>
<p>Upgrading the base edition with these extras is great for those who don't already own them, and less so for those who paid money for them in the past several years. Paradox are positioning the new Starter Edition and lowered Ultimate Bundle cost as a "special treat" for those players, although that seems less than convincing. The Ultimate Bundle typically costs £313.56, by the way - albeit minus the cost of any included DLC you already own.
</p>
<p>From now until September 9th, the base game of EUIV is 76% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">over on Steam</a>, making it £8.39/$10. That'll grant you access to the four DLCs when they unlock for everyone October 17th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only is he a former WWE superstar, but he’s a world-renowned talent who has his name in the annals of U.S. wrestling history with WWE and then-competitors WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling. In many ways, Jericho’s involvement with AEW legitimized it as a new avenue for wayward WWE veterans and new talent alike. Unfortunately, however, most if not all of Jericho’s booking has hampered new talent rather than helping them flourish.<br></p><p>Traditionally, wrestlers enter a feud with another talent that can last upwards of a month with a big payoff at a pay-per-view where the victor—typically a good guy—graduates into a bigger feud with someone who has a championship or is issued a rematch with their villainous competitor. This structure allows companies to build new stars by having them overcome feuds with industry veterans or promising new talent. However, Jericho’s feuds—unaffectionately dubbed the “Jericho vortex” by fans—have had the opposite effect. Jericho’s booking only benefits himself while keeping younger talent like Konosuke Takeshita, Ricky Starks, Darby Allin, and Hook caught in his nebulous orbit until he’s done with them.<br></p><p>AEW’s “Jericho Vortex” phenomenon started to take shape when fans noticed that the Canadian wrestler’s feuds with younger talent felt more like Jericho clinging to their coattails for relevancy. As an AEW fan, knowing your favorite wrestler was entering a program with Jericho meant you wouldn’t see them do anything worth watching until the Jericho Vortex was done sucking up all their star power. Things have gotten so bad that fans began <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ItsGresh/status/1826703038561878283?t=-kZkwCARz0YwtN8kF-ANzw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ItsGresh/status/1826703038561878283?t=-kZkwCARz0YwtN8kF-ANzw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memeing the phenomenon on X/Twitter</a></span> with videos of migrating WWE superstars interrupted by Jericho’s theme music—signaling that they, too, will be stuck in his vortex.<br></p><p>While the Jericho Vortex isn’t as all-encompassing and toxic as Hulk Hogan’s disastrous late-stage TNA run, it has garnered its fair share of groans from AEW audiences whenever they see a promising young talent enter a deadlock feud with the 53-year-old wrestler. Four months ago, fans voiced their growing frustration with Jericho by chanting “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheEnemiesPE3/status/1790911976681398700?t=iqkZzl5xCrS0pY7AZ41cow&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheEnemiesPE3/status/1790911976681398700?t=iqkZzl5xCrS0pY7AZ41cow&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please retire</a></span>!” at him during AEW’s Dynasty pay-per-view.</p><p>Instead of retiring, Jericho did what he usually does: create an on-screen character with a new gimmick. Only this time around, instead of backing off of the antics that got him bad heat in the first place, Jericho leaned fully into the Jericho Vortex meme with his new bad guy persona, “The Learning Tree.”<br></p><p>With this new gimmick, Jericho takes up precious TV time every other week in a talk show segment called “TV Time with Jericho,” a glorified promo segment where Jericho and his lackeys glaze him up while standing next to cardboard cutouts of trees. During these segments, he refers to the Jericho Vortex by name, claiming it’s a mutually beneficial feud for his opponents. In theory, Jericho’s newfound gimmick is meant to give fans a scripted reason to boo him by utilizing their frustrations with how his booking tends to overshadow younger talent. But in practice, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PhilDL616/status/1830967096567832668&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PhilDL616/status/1830967096567832668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans absolutely hate it</a></span>. Jericho’s Learning Tree bit makes everything worse because it excuses how terrible his booking continues to be by retroactively folding it into his character arc.<br></p><p>Moreover, Jericho’s character—a fake-smiling “I’ve got the company’s best interest at heart” do-gooder is already cribbing off of The Young Bucks’ <em>Succession</em>-inspired EVP gimmick.

I’m not talking about its story, though you will see some dark turns before your journey in Fa’diel ends. Instead I mean that underneath the bright and casual facade of <em>Visions of Mana</em> lies a deceptively deep RPG. I was amazed at how immersed I was in the game’s class system and team building, and I didn’t expect I’d spend so much time just exploring and uncovering secrets.<br></p><p>That said, to get the most out of <em>Visions of Mana</em>, you do have to kind of play by its rules. For example, if you don’t engage with the game’s RPG systems and try to brute force every battle with your action game sensibilities, you’re straight-up going to have a bad time. To get right to the crunchy center of what makes this trip to the Mana Tree so good, check out these ten tips that will make your journey sing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-recommend-id="image://4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-recommend-id="image://4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve followed <em>Visions of Mana</em> at all, you probably know that it’s the fifth mainline entry in Square Enix’s <em>Mana</em> series (also known as <em>Seiken Densetsu</em>). Fortunately, you won’t miss anything by skipping right to <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Each game in the series typically takes place in its own world, so you aren’t missing any context that would help you understand this one better.<br></p><p>The main point of confusion is that, much like how <em>Legend of Zelda</em> take place across different iterations of Hyrule, <em>Mana</em> games all feature different incarnations of the same world of Fa’Diel. Bosses, locations, and characters will reappear in each game, but they have no connection to their appearances in past games. Similarly, “Sacrifice” tends to be a recurring theme in <em>Mana</em> games, which might make the premise of <em>Visions of Mana</em> make more sense as you’re starting out.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-recommend-id="image://7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-recommend-id="image://7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The 2020 remake of <em>Trials of Mana</em> is an infamously easy game. It’s not a total cakewalk, but you definitely need to play it on Hard mode to experience any friction in the combat. By comparison, <em>Visions of Mana</em> is more balanced. Hard mode actually feels tough, so you may prefer Normal mode after coming off of a <em>Trials of Mana</em> playthrough.</p><p>Fortunately, difficulty settings can be changed at any time, so you can decide to dial up or down the challenge as you progress.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-recommend-id="image://e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-recommend-id="image://e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Having said all that, I really recommend a Hard mode playthrough for anyone who wants to have a crunchy RPG experience. It doesn’t feel great in the early game, since enemies inflict major damage and can soak a ton of hits before they’re defeated. At the same time, Hard mode really forces you to optimize your defenses and offenses equally. You know, the kind of stuff that RPG fans enjoy strategizing around. Once you get into some of the game’s deadly DPS builds, those enemy lifebars aren’t going to feel big at all.</p><p>This is how I experienced <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and I recommend it for anyone else who wants to dive into everything that the game’s class system offers.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of chapter 1, you’ll eventually board a boat in Rhata Harbor to continue the main story. This isn’t a point of no return, but it does lock you out of returning to that first continent for now. Fast travel at Meridians can’t cross bodies of water, but rest assured that you’ll unlock other ways to travel the world as you advance the main story.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-recommend-id="image://cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Help help, make it go away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Help help, make it go away." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-recommend-id="image://cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Help help, make it go away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> has a lot of quests. In fact, if you attempt to complete all the optional content in the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405">you can add about 20 extra hours to your run time</a></span>. Some of these are part of larger side quest chains, such as Niccolo’s requests or the woman who asks you to find locations depicted in paintings. Otherwise, most quests exist as an excuse for you to grind. These won’t affect your playthrough if they remain unfinished.</p><p>You can see what a side quest will award you right in the Side Quests tab of your main menu. Quests that give equipment or ability seeds are worth prioritizing, but you can typically save quests that only give money for later. If you’re not in the mood to kill five monsters or find a trinket in a field, don’t force yourself.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="518ca4125df75377b19bd86b550d4d8c" data-recommend-id="image://518ca4125df75377b19bd86b550d4d8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's...an empty courtyard?

However, a fledgling level one Val will <em>not</em> have the ability to 100 percent complete each area he sees. Some chests are hidden inside ruins that house endgame monsters. Others require Elemental Vessels that you don’t have yet. Either way, you’ll need to return later to collect every reward.</p><p>As a fun tip, <em>Visions of Mana</em> will always add new markers on old maps showing you where you can use new Elemental Vessels. There’s no need to take notes if you encounter something you can’t interact with!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-recommend-id="image://3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-recommend-id="image://3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Elemental Aeries are optional battle arenas that you’ll find all throughout your journey. These typically make you fight two waves of powerful enemies, and you’ll only have a couple minutes to pull it off. Fortunately, most character’s class strike skills are <em>very</em> good at totally clearing entire groups of enemies, so these challenges will feel way easier if you begin with a fully charged gauge. The timer won’t even run as the flashy animation plays!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-recommend-id="image://36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-recommend-id="image://36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You will unlock a lot of character classes in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. To upgrade them, you’ll need to advance the Elemental Plots found in your main menu. Each character only has so many points to invest in each track found here, so you unfortunately can’t invest in every skill you see.</p><p>That said, even if you don’t use a certain class, any spells or moves learned via Elemental Plots <em>will</em> stick with the character no matter how they’re built. This means characters like Val can natively equip almost every elemental imbuement in the game, while Careena can use debuffs even if you’re using her as a Monk. Characters can only bring so many spells into battle, though, so make sure you set their ring menus after unlocking skills!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-recommend-id="image://c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-recommend-id="image://c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As deep as the class system is in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, it does have some limitations. You can’t respec your characters until very late in the game, and the way you approach boss battles will differ from the way you approach Elemental Aeries. Fortunately, you’ll unlock five characters before your journey ends, and building all of them will let you adapt to different situations as you encounter them. For example, you can build Palamena to inflict massive damage on bosses, while Careena can specialize in Class Strike damage that absolutely destroys huge waves of common enemies.</p><p>All characters earn equal EXP, even if you don’t use them in battle. Specialize all your characters in a way that compliments the team—you’ll be happy to have those extra options on standby as you progress.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-recommend-id="image://f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-recommend-id="image://f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I weally would have wiked this fweature in Twials of Mana<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s October release looming, BioWare is starting to discuss the finer details of its latest fantasy RPG. And its newest deep-dive provides a look at how progression will work for protagonist Rook and the companions they'll meet along the way.
</p>
<p>
Rook's progression systems won't, it has to be said, be much of a surprise to anyone that's had even the faintest brush with a video game in the last decade. Players do stuff, earn XP, gain a new Skill Point each level, then spend them to unlock new abilities on a skill tree.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-and-progression">latest blog post</a> does, however, go a little deeper into the minutiae of things - explaining, for instance, that the biggest experience boost comes from completing quests, although there's still XP to be earn from combat and exploration. Of more interest, though, are the particulars of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's skill tree.
</p>

<p>
Different nodes come in different shapes, and those shapes reflect the type of unlockable it contains. Large circles, for instance, denote core Class skills and weapon proficiencies, while diamonds indicate an unlockable ability that can be placed in your hero's abilities slot. Medium circles, meanwhile, feature major passive or ability upgrades - which add effects and modifiers to existing Abilities or stats - and then we're onto the slightly less impactful stuff.
</p>
<p>
Small hexagons contain traits that modify existing Class skills, while small circles unlock minor boosts to Abilities, Passive, or stats. And if you don't like your choices, Skill Points can be refunded at any time, with no penalty cost.
</p>
<p>
It's not just skills that can be upgraded, however; weapons, armour, and accessories all have their own stats and properties, and equipment can be upgraded and enchanted to unlock additional effects at the Caretaker's Workshop. A single enchantment can be applied to each item and ability, and more enchantments unlock each time the workshop is upgraded. And for fashionable types, armour transmogrification and appearance-only armour is available.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
What's more, all the above works works in conjunction with Dragon Age: The Veilguard's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">faction-themed specialisations areas</a>, each featuring unique combat abilities and Ultimate abilities. All Classes - that is, warriors, rogues, and mages - have access to three specialisation areas, and these, BioWare notes, are available to all Rooks, regardless of their chosen faction.
</p>
<p>
As for Rook's companions, each has their own skill tree, and every level they reach unlocks two Skill Points. Companions gain experience fastest through specific quests deepening their relationship with Rook, but experience is also earned through unique conversations and decisions, with bonds and quests coming in both romantic and platonic flavours.
</p>
<p>
Two companions can accompany Rook on a mission, and each has their own gear, which can also be managed, upgraded, and enhanced as players see fit. Additionally, companions have their own Primer and Detonator abilities, the Detonator triggering - and causing increased damage and stagger - if the correct combination of abilities are used. By way of example, BioWare explains Rook can use Toxic Dash to prime a target with the Sundered status, which can then be donated using Neve's Icebreaker ability. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare's blog post contains a couple of videos showing character and companion progression in a little more detail if you're curious, although it does warn some of these may contain "minor spoilers". And if your enthusiasm is piqued, Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 31st October.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-painstaking-process-of-adding-rideable-horses-to-fallout-new-vegas.972228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fallout-new-vegas-horse-mod-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> does not contain horses, but it <em>feels </em>like it should. The now 14-year-old game’s whole vibe is <a href="https://medium.com/@thelegendarytai/fallout-new-vegas-the-wild-west-through-and-through-d30bb7cff1fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly Wild West</a>, and yet there’s nary a four-legged steed to be seen. The reason for this is simple: In <em>Fallout </em>canon, horses are <a href="https://falloutfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Horse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely extinct</a>. But that hasn’t stopped one modder, Xїlandro Axeuora, from <a href="https://twitter.com/Xilandro/status/1826434205238043045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to add them</a>. Slowing him down, however, are his own expectations, born of other games that came out long after <em>New Vegas</em> made its mark.&nbsp;</p><p>Axeuora, who lives in Ukraine, is working alongside two other modders to complete his vision, which is informed foremost by <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, a game with horses so detailed that their <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-hours-with-the-amazingly-detailed-red-dead-redempti-1829187487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testicles shrink and expand</a> based on the in-game temperature.&nbsp;</p><p>"In my head I constantly compare what Rockstar developers created – animations aside, of course; I don't have a horse and a mocap studio – and what I'm making,” Axeuora, who says this mod has cost him his “sanity,” told Aftermath. “So I keep rewriting code over and over again, looking for that 'OK, this feels close enough' moment."</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Xilandro/status/1826434205238043045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What he has right now</a> already looks remarkably smooth, like it time traveled back from a more recent game to save <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> from its grim, horseless future. But Axeuora still isn’t satisfied.</p><p>“As for replicating, [I’m doing] whatever I can,” he said. “But most importantly (and most difficult): the overall feel of natural horse movement [from <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>] without sacrificing responsiveness of controls. Not ‘realistic,’ just natural. It's a living, breathing creature. It can't move and turn like an arcadey tank.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some have suggested that Axeuora and his collaborators are simply porting over the horses from Bethesda stablemate<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>. Axeuora urges those people to go <a href="https://twitter.com/Xilandro/status/1827360809590071349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">watch a video</a> of that game’s herky-jerky excuses for equines to see how they stack up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Axeuora has been working on the project for “a couple months,” but he’s been trying to wrap his brain around player movement in<em> New Vegas </em>– specifically via cars – since early this year. It’s been a fraught process, one ridden with burnout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Horses were so similar [to other player movement mods] underneath that I ended up doing rather similar work, with the same issues popping up as well. And it quickly nuked the last remains of my motivation," he said. "Some days I just blast nonstop, and then [I] procrastinate for a week or something."&nbsp;</p><p>But Axeuora is gonna get this horse over the finish line, come hell or high water.</p><p>“I've been modding <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> since 2012,” he said. “This isn't my first rodeo (pun totally intended). No breaks until horses are done, though. If I drop them now, I'm not coming back to them ever again.”</p><p>He’s not quite sure when they’ll be done. Could be one month, could be the end of the year. As with a real horse, there are many moving parts involved: Axeuora’s mental state, his pending “aha!” moment where horse movement is concerned, and the availability of other modders.&nbsp;</p><p>He joked grimly about one more possible impediment.&nbsp;</p><p>"I also might very well get killed at any moment by a Russian missile strike,” Axeuora said, “which will make releasing horses a bit difficult.”</p><p>Which kind of puts everything in perspective. That in mind, Axeuora and his horse mod <em>absolutely </em>will not be cowed by a vocal segment of <em>Fallout </em>fans who’ve chosen to question the project: lore purists.</p><p>"We mod <em>Fallout </em>games because we love them, and that includes canon,” he said. “Practically speaking, there's nothing that stops us from giving every NPC in <em>New Vegas</em> a vegetation-based STD, with fungus growing out of their lower parts, or making hordes of giant man-eating battle brahmin swarm Mojave Wasteland. ... Anything we make, no matter how big or small, how lore-breaking or strictly dogmatic, is just that: [a] modification. Optional user-created content. It won't suddenly become part of the canon, and mods' existence can be ignored altogether. We can only speculate why some people are so overly concerned about what mods do. But they really shouldn't be."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The development of Football Manager 25 has hit yet another snag. Developer Sports Interactive studio manager <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Miles Jacobson has announced</a> that Football Manager 25’s release is being delayed from early November to late November.</p>



<p>“Firstly, we’ve had to shift the official announcement of FM25 to the end of September,” he said. “The gameplay focus period will follow soon thereafter. Our target launch date has moved accordingly and is now scheduled for late November, rather than our usual early November slot.”</p>



<p>In addition to the game’s reveal and launch delay, Jacobson announced that a couple features were being removed from the game. </p>



<p>International Management is being removed from the game on PC, Console, and FM 25 Touch. The reasoning given is that after looking at where it was at this point in development, it was decided that what was going to release wouldn’t reach the company’s “initial quality threshold”.</p>



<p>“We also considered the available game data,” Jacobson said. “Only 5.6% of all FM24 PC saves have used the mode, which we feel validates our view that we need to do much, much better with the experience. That number is even smaller on Console.”</p>



<p>He did say that it will remain available in Football Manager 25 Mobile due to it being built with a different codebase.</p>



<p>“For all other versions, international management will return in a much more feature-rich way to FM26, FM26 Console and FM26 Touch in what will be an exciting year for international football with the World Cup expanding to 48 teams,” he said. </p>



<p>The other removed feature isn’t a major one, but a removal nonetheless. Player weights will no longer be visible within profiles across the game.</p>



<p>Jacobson says that the introduction of Women’s soccer to the game is the leading factor in the decision. </p>



<p>“Through the creation of our Women’s Football database, we discovered that while the weight of male athletes can change a bit month to month, women’s body types are very different from men’s and their weight fluctuates a lot more, often weekly,” he said.</p>



<p>“This perspective encouraged us to review the wider game, much like we have with all other areas, and we’ve ultimately decided to no longer show weight for any players in FM25. A very basic measurement will still be included under the hood, but it won’t be visible on the front end anymore.”</p>



<p>The reason for the multiple delays and feature removals stem from the game’s transition over to the Unity Engine. The series had been built on the studio’s own internal Sports Interactive Operating System (SIOS).</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has apparently provided a fresh new timeline for The Legend of Zelda series, one that famously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-complete-legend-of-zelda-timeline-explained/1100-6513317/" data-ref-id="1100-6513317">splits off into three different branches after Ocarina of Time</a>. We now have an idea of where the most recent entries--Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom--fit into the franchise's chronology. Spoilers: They don't, instead being placed into their own little timeline.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.vooks.net/new-zelda-timeline-places-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-seperate-from-older-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vooks</a> spotted the new Legend of Zelda timeline <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/nintendo-live-2024-sydney/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Nintendo Live</a> over this past weekend in Sydney, Australia. The image--seen below--was shared <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1829703963794624594" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> by Wario64, showing Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom separated from the official chronology that begins with Skyward Sword.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-timeline-revised-to-include-breath-of-the-wi/1100-6460970/" data-ref-id="1100-6460970">there was a thought that Breath of the Wild brought the three branches back together</a> and corralled them into a new single sequence as the "last" game. However, this new graphic appears to rule that out. This would mean the timeline has become even more confusing, putting it on par <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-evolution-of-michael-myers-throughout-the-halloween-movies/2900-4917/" data-ref-id="2900-4917">with the Halloween movies</a>. However, <a href="https://zelda.nintendo.com/about/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the North American website for the Zelda franchise</a> has not updated with any placement for Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always sort of seemed like Zelda fans cared a lot more about the timeline than Nintendo ever has. In fact, an official Zelda timeline wasn't even publicly available until the Hyrule Historia book arrived in the early 2010s, decades after the video game franchise was born on NES.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind the updated timeline doesn't even touch on where the upcoming Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might land. GameSpot just got a recent hands-on with the Switch exclusive and notes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-plays-like-a-mini-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6526268/" data-ref-id="1100-6526268">it plays like a mini Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-progression-systems-get-fully-detailed-by-bioware/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the launch preparations, BioWare has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-and-progression?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new blog post and video dedicated to the progression systems within Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The info dump begins with confirming the level cap, which the developers have set at 50. While experience points can be obtained by killing enemies and exploring the world, players will find it far easier to level up by completing quests, especially the bigger ones.</p>
<p>With each level, players will be granted a Skill Point to spend in the so-called Constellation Tree. There are many options to choose from, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large circle: Class (core skills and weapon proficiencies)</li>
<li>Diamond: Ability (can be assigned to an Ability slot)</li>
<li>Medium circle: Major Passive or Ability Upgrade (adds effects or modifies existing Abilities or stats, like guaranteeing a critical hit on knockdown or extending range)</li>
<li>Small hexagon: Trait (modifies existing class skill, like counter-attack, extending an attack combo or missile block/return)</li>
<li>Small circle: Minor Passive or Stat Boost (increases the efficacy of Abilities, Passive, or stats)</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Very importantly, Skill Points can be refunded for the entire Skill Tree or individually at any time and for free, allowing Dragon Age: The Veilguard players a high degree of experimentation throughout their entire playthroughs.</p>
<p>As you would expect, given the type of game, there will be a variety of equipment to loot or purchase, including weapons, armor, and accessories. Each item will have its own unique stats and attributes. As weapons and armor evolve, duplicate items will allow you to increase stats and unlock additional features. Players can further upgrade and enchant the items through the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse hub. There will be a list of basic enchantments at first, but each time Rook upgrades the rank of the Caretaker's Workshop, more enchantments will become available. Each item or ability can have a single enchantment applied to it, and each enchantment can only be applied to a single item or ability at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Upon creating their 'Rook' character, players will align with a faction. The chosen Faction will affect the initial appearance of the Rook, especially when dressed in casual clothing. However, all visible armor can be transmogrified' into anything else that has been collected via the wardrobe in the Lighthouse.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Progression Deep Dive | Parts 1-3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvr3OV8kYcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, Dragon Age: The Veilguard also allows the progression of Rook's companions, who are getting two Skill Points for each level. Ways to get experience for your companions include completing their personal quests as well as dialogues and decisions made with them.</p>
<p>Players may take two companions on missions. Each companion has its own gear to manage, which can also be upgraded and enchanted in the aforementioned Caretaker's Workshop. Companions also have Primers and Detonators, which can be combined with each other or with the Rook in combat. Each Primer has a matching Detonator. When the correct combination is used, a detonation is triggered - dealing increased damage over an area and increasing the stagger. For example, as seen in the video, Rook can use Toxic Dash to detonate the Sundered target, and Neve can detonate it with her Icebreaker ability.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-launch-on-october-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 31</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Today Dropout announced that <em>Misfits &amp; Magic</em> Season 2 will be premiering on September 25th.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Misfits &amp; Magic </em>season two sees the return of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a77a65bf-2dda-4081-be3d-d54808255109" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aabria-iyengar-discusses-burrows-end-finale-dice-telling-story-and-what-happens">Aabria Iyengar</a> as the DM of this season of Kids on Brooms, a magic based expansion for Kids on Bikes.</p>
<p>Joining Aabria will be <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">Brennan Lee Mulligan as Evan Kelmp</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">Erika Ishii </a>as K, Danielle Radford as Sam Blask, and Lou Wilson as Whitney Jammer. All of the cast from the original season is reprising their roles as we get to catch up with the magical misfits three years after the events of the first season.</p>

<p>While not much has been officially revealed about this new season the ever-present theme of the winds of change has many members of the magical world spooked.</p>
<p>Throughout the trailer we get hints of the story among the characters reuniting, hints as to what each character might have been up to since we last spoke with them.</p>
<p>"Three years since the events that we last left off with. You're just at that age where you're exiting the traditional understanding of childhood and you're deciding who you want to be... and death is on the table"</p>
<p>A few interesting props in the dome were also shown off. Bicycle handles put into the dome for each player, a very clear reference to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, a diorama of a solar system in the center of the table that we will see moving, and an animated tablet that will talk to the players.</p>
<p>Season Two of <em>Misfits &amp; Magic</em> will release on September 25th of Dropout.tv. There will be 11 episodes in total putting the finale episode on December 4th.</p>

            <p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> reached version 5.0 with the Worlds update, which refreshed its planetary generation to introduce more variety alongside more detailed water, clouds, and weather. We didn't write about it at the time, because I suppose re-writing the very fabric of the galaxy seemed small-time.
</p>
<p>Today's new update, however, adds fishing, and I can't not write about that.

Here's the trailer:

<p>The update is called Aquarius, and it makes use of the Worlds update's fancy new oceans with their pulsing, reflective surfaces by allowing you to cast a line into them. There's a wide range of different underwater life to find, from "common minnow-like fish to huge alien marine mammals", according <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/">to the announcement</a>. You'll need to find different bodies of water on different planets to collect them all.
</p>
<p>To help matters, there's a new "Exo-Skiff" which can be deployed, and is basically a hovering, customisable fishing platform. It's got a built-in fridge for storing your catches within. Or you can build your own automated fish farm, whcih will gather fish for you while you're elsewhere, killing some other kind of flora or fauna. However you collect your fish, you can cook 'em for dinner if you wish.
</p>
<p>I'm genuinely fond of fishing in games, particularly in those games like Zelda or Kirby where the fishing is far aside from the much more dramatic adventure I'm meant to be having. No Man's Sky's system seems to have a lot of charming detail, too, including the ability to catch "messages in bottles" left by other players. Cute.
</p>
<p>Aquarius is out now and free to all players. No Man's Sky is also currently 60% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">over on Steam</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-space-exploration-fest-kicks-off-deals-and-demos-on-september-2nd">Steam Space Exploration Fest</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
