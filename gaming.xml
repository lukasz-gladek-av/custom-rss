            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The soundtrack for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> includes only 10 tracks from the original two games, after Tony Hawk himself wanted to emphasise music discovery.</p>
<p>The full soundtrack was <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/uk/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">revealed at the start of June</a> by publisher Activision, but ahead of the game's full release this week, reviews have criticised changes to the soundtrack and its lack of songs from the original games.</p>
<p>Out of the 69 songs across both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, only 10 from the original games have been included. Instead, in some instances, a different song from the same artist has been used - the remainder are new to the series.</p>

<p>Those 10 returning songs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Faction - Skate &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Gang Starr - Mass Appeal</li>
<li>JFA - Beach Blanket Bongout</li>
<li>RUN-D.M.C. - My Adidas</li>
<li>Motörhead - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Del the Funky Homosapien - If You Must</li>
<li>AFI - The Boy Who Destroyed the World</li>
<li>Adolescents - Amoeba</li>
<li>CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings</li>
<li>Bodyjar - Not the Same</li>
</ol>
<p>One major reason for not including certain songs may be licensing issues.</p>
<p>However, in the same blog post revealing the soundtrack, Christopher Wilson, VP of production at Activision Publishing stated: "We wanted to keep the feel of the original games but also introduce new artists and songs."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the project, Tony added tracks and suggested using different songs from artists that were featured on the original games.</p>
<p>"The soundtrack is meant to be a love letter to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> franchise, skateboarding in general, and be an opportunity to showcase music that falls outside of the mainstream."</p>
<p>Wilson's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-was-tony-hawks-choice-to-pick-some-different-songs-by-the-same-artists-in-pro-skater-34-remake">mirror those of Hawk himself</a>, who previously stated on an Instagram post it was his choice "to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST".</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place," he said. "So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>
<p>Still, the soundtracks to all the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games are iconic, reflecting the musical tastes of the early 00s. The changes have left some fans disappointed, in response to reviews by critics.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">returning for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is skater Bam Margera</a>, after Hawk intervened.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on 11th July across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft). It's available in early access now for those who pre-ordered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-includes-only-10-tracks-from-original-games-as-focus-shifts-to-new-music]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-group-franchise-model-dan-ayoub/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-group-shifts-to-%E2%80%98franchise-model%E2%80%99-internally-will-be-led-by-ex-halo-veteran.1239081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, we learned that the Dungeons &amp; Dragons group within Wizards of the Coast would shift to a 'franchise model' internally, where everything about the beloved fantasy IP sits under the same roof. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348517655173054464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> by Dan Ayoub, a game industry veteran who spent a long time at Microsoft working on the Halo franchise, from Halo: Reach to Halo: Infinite. He left in 2021 to become Vice President at Certain Affinity, though that didn't last long, as he <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-wars-head-dan-ayoub-wizards-of-the-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved again to Wizards of the Coast in 2022</a>, first as VP/Head of Studios and then as Senior VP of Digital Games. Now, Ayoub has been promoted to head the whole Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise:</p>



<p><em>So, what happened today? We shifted our structure internally and D&amp;D moved to a full franchise model, meaning everything: books, video games, film, and TV – everything touching the franchise lives under one roof. The impact here cannot be overstated; this is massive for D&amp;D and will allow a strong, coordinated, and well-funded approach for the franchise, and most importantly, for us, the fans.</em></p>



<p><em>Finally, in a moment that doubtlessly has my childhood self doing cartwheels (and okay, maybe some old man cartwheels too), I've been asked to lead this new group! As of today, I am thrilled, humbled, and somewhat freaked out to be leading the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise for Wizards of the Coast.</em></p>



<p>Ayoub mentioned film and TV, but there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no publicly known plans to create a sequel to Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a>, which only barely recouped its budget, and work on the TV series that was going to air on Paramount+ has been paused.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast does have plenty of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games in the works, though:</p>



<ul>
<li>The digital fantasy tabletop adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out in late 2025;</li>



<li>Project Baxter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a co-op game in development at Starbreeze</a> and scheduled to launch next year;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The company is also hard at work on the future of the Baldur's Gate series, of course. In March, Dan Ayoub <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-fans-will-know-more-about-the-franchises-future-in-short-order-says-hasbro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> fans of the franchise would know more about what's coming next in 'short order'.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A little bit of Mario Kart trivia for you — what is the one Nintendo track you can't play anywhere but the series' smartphone spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is Piranha Plant Pipeline, a fun, waterslide-esque level set within the bowels of various Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes that for some reason never got ported over into Switch entry Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Tour's lengthy track roster is a mix of classic tracks and new courses that also arrived in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the game's Booster Course Pass. These included Squeaky Clean Sprint, a level partially set in a toilet, and Sky-High Sundae, which was immediately brought back for Switch 2 as part of Mario Kart World's open-world map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Piranha Plant Pipeline never made the jump to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and because of Mario Kart Tour's rotating track selection it is only rarely playable. Indeed, Nintendo celebrated the track's return with a post <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1942826049639006482%7Ctwgr%5E81d207006539890989a8031d8157fbf376b45753%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FmariokarttourEN%2Fstatus%2F1942826049639006482" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">today</a> on X/Twitter, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mario-kart-tour-grants-access-to-a-track-unplayable-anywhere-else" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Life</a> notes that the course's reappearance now marks only the third time it has ever been playable, and its first appearance this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well hello Piranha Plant Pipeline," one fan wrote. "Missed you so much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try out what may be Mario Kart's rarest track, you have until 22nd July to do it, before Piranha Plant Pipeline goes back in Nintendo's content vault. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we ever see it return in another Mario Kart game? Much will likely depend on Nintendo's plans to keep <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> fresh over the coming years — something the company is currently keeping schtum on. Fans strongly suspect that Nintendo will at some point detail a post-launch content roadmap for its hugely-popular Switch 2 launch title, though Nintendo is yet to say anything of how it may keep its racer refreshed over the coming generation. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pipe Tour starts today and it features Piranha Plant Pipeline! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartTour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartTour</a> <a href="https://t.co/6X76J0X7w0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6X76J0X7w0</a></p>— Mario Kart Tour (@mariokarttourEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Nintendo's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">only major update to Mario Kart World so far has been its unpopular move to further limit the chances of racing on the franchise's standard looped courses</a>, rather than so-called open-world 'intermission tracks'.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Nintendo wrapped up launching new content for Mario Kart Tour back in 2023, the game remains playable on iPhone and Android devices. Originally launched in 2019, Mario Kart Tour made millions for Nintendo, though its gacha-style system for unlocking characters and karts was heavily criticised, and was later removed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo smartphone has a mixed track record on keeping its smartphone games online, with several notable titles such as Miitomo, Draglia Lost and Dr. Mario World no longer playable. The original free-to-play version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was shutdown, meanwhile, but replaced with a pricey paid-for alternative. Should Mario Kart Tour ever get retired, Piranha Plant Pipeline will disappear forever with it — so maybe give it a go now, while you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is ready to stick a rusty knife into its distended fleshsack of horror IP collaborations yet again, this time resulting in The Walking Dead splattering wetly onto its gore-soaked floor. We already knew the collaboration was coming, of course, but with its public test build now live, developer Behaviour Interactive has finally detailed exactly what's involved.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration introduces two new survivors, bringing three new perks apiece: Rick Grimes - the man with more hat than personality (until he gave away his hat) - and formidable zombie slayer (plus pointy sword fan) Michonne Grimes.
</p>
<p>
Rick comes with the Apocalyptic Ingenuity perk, which enables him to turn broken pallets into fragile pallets after interacting with a certain number of chests, plus the Come and Get Me perk, which causes Rick to scream, alerting the killer to his aura, but prevents injured or dying survivors from leaving scratch marks or blood trails within a certain radius. Additionally, there's the Toughen Up teamwork perk, which reduces Rick's grunts of pain, scratch marks, and pools of blood when another survivor pallet-stuns or blinds the killer while he's injured.

<p>
As for Michonne, her Conviction perk lets her recover immediately after healing a survivor while downed, but Broken is then applied, downing her again after a certain length of time. Last Stand, meanwhile, is a once-per-trial perk that lets Michonne fast-vault and stun the killer after she's been in its terror radius for a set amount of time. As for her Throw Down teamwork perk, it gives Endurance to other survivors and lets them see the killer's aura briefly when she pallet-stun or blinds the killer. You'll find a few more specifics - alongside details of other updates and enhancements - in Behaviour Interactive's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/538857783458533234?l=english">9.1.0 patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration - which arrives sandwiched between its previously announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's and The Witcher collaborations</a> - can be played right now via the game's public test build on PC, but Behaviour notes Michonne Grimes won't be included due to "known technical issues". Expect these to be resolved, the studio says, in time for update 9.1.0's full release across all platforms on 29th July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9aM9Ch97U8">La jiggy jar jar doo</a>.

			<p>A new Stellar Blade mod now available for download brings significant visual improvements by introducing ray-traced global illumination to the game.</p>



<p>The mod, developed by Atlas813 and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/1227?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, doesn't require any paid shared or third party assets so users don't need anything else other than ReShade to use it. Besides introducing RTGI with proper light bouncing and diffuse lights, the mod introduces ambient light correction, a sharpening effect that only sharpens close objects, among other features that introduce significant visual improvements as highlighted by the comparison screenshots below taken at 1080p resolution, max settings, and NVIDIA DLSS Quality.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> game director Vinit Agarwal has announced he is off to Japan to start his own studio.</p>
<p>Agarwal was at Naughty Dog for a decade, before he departed the company in January of this year. During his time at the studio, he worked on both the Uncharted and The Last of Us series. Most recently, he was director of Naughty Dog's cancelled standalone The Last of Us online multiplayer.</p>

<p>Sharing a "couple of life updates" on <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1942603344746537024">social media last night</a>, Agarwal said: "Moving to Japan tomorrow. Also forming a game studio - more on that soon!"</p>
<p>While the developer did not share any further specifics on exactly what he will be working on when his new studio takes shape, in an <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1930309271683772464">earlier exchange on social media</a> Agarwal said he would continue to make multiplayer games following The Last of Us online's cancellation, as that is what he is "passionate about".</p>
<p>Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-confirms-the-last-of-us-2-wont-have-multiplayer-after-all">in 2019 the studio announced its sequel would release as a solo experience</a>, with a multiplayer aspect planned to arrive at a later date. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-says-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time">following word the studio needed more time on the project</a>, Naughty Dog ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled The Last of Us' online multiplayer release in 2023</a>. At this time, the developer said it didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".</p>
<p>Agarwal subsequently announced he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vinit-agarwal-47b3213_todays-my-last-day-naughty-dog-grateful-activity-7283634874274476032-KhfY/">leaving Naughty Dog in January of this year</a>. Sharing an update on LinkedIn, Agarwal said he was grateful for his decade at the studio, but the time had come for a "new adventure" and to make "something of [his] own". The former studio director then thanked his colleagues and mentors, namechecking Robert Cogburn, Erin Daly, Bruce Straley, Neil Druckmann and Evan Wells. Of those named, only Druckmann remains at Naughty Dog now.</p>

<p>Druckmann himself is currently working on Naughty Dog's all new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">recently stepped back from The Last of Us TV adaptation to focus on the studio</a>.

<p>Earlier this year, the star of Naughty Dog's upcoming game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-and-the-last-of-us-game-designer-starting-new-studio]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're a fan of football games, you'll know they're likely a familiar affair at this point. A continuous river of annual releases, slight upgrades, and the prioritisation of simulating a real game of footy over anything too drastic. This might even be a bit of a stretch, with the majority of football fans starting and ending with EA Sports FC.</p>
<p>Enter Rematch, which has proven <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">exceptionally popular</a> since its release last month. The game managed to find a gap between the big-budget defenders and snuck in a shot on goal. CEO of developer Sloclap, Pierre Tarno, told Eurogamer that this current sports game ecosystem offered the perfect opportunity to tap into a vast community.</p>

<p>Although it turns out, not necessarily football fans! Eurogamer is home to some big fans of Sloclap's moreish sports game, but even we can't deny that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Rematch players are sometimes infuriating</a>, which now is a lot easier to understand. Tarno claims: "There was a space, clearly. I do think however that our fans go further than those of sports games. In fact, we see via data, currently the core audience of Rematch lean towards those who play online competitive games rather than those who are fans of football."</p>
<p>This is true of the developers themselves, too. It may surprise you that even the developers at Slapclap aren't a collective of football fanatics. Tarno would go on to explain: "Loads of people in the team don't really care about football at all. But quite early on in the project, team mates who weren't super convinced by it - [after] when we ran internal tournaments - told me 'I get it now. I don't give a s**t about football, but this really struck something in me.' The dynamics, the team play, I think those are what make it interesting for players even if they don't like or play football games."</p>
<p>Tarno's reasoning for why the Rematch community has broken out this way is a simple one: "First of all I think it's something that's going to evolve. I think the main reason is the main portion of our untapped audience are players who are not as savvy about games, are perhaps not hardcore gamers, and are as such less aware of new releases. They may not inform themselves as much as core gamers who follow the news, monitor new releases, and will jump on games as they come out."</p>
<p>It's this ocean of sports fans that Slowclap aims to dive into through Rematch. Doing so, however, will take time: "They play FIFA, but they don't read Eurogamer. Maybe they play FIFA <em>and</em> Call of Duty! But they're just waiting for their annual release. To reach them it's about word of mouth, continuing to communicate, and keep rolling out updates."</p>
<p>As with all competitive games, the play styles in fashion change over time, new players become more familiar with the mechanics and a more established audience is cemented for the longhaul. Maybe, if we get our wish, goalies will stop trying to flick the ball over their head from inside their own area. We can hope.</p>

			<p>In the annals of mascot platformers, Gex goes largely forgotten. Behind the colossi of Mario, Sonic and even the second string of Crash and Spyro, the lecherous gecko ends up alongside the likes of Bubsy the Bob Cat in prestige. Unlike that feline protagonist, however, Gex has starred in some decent games. The relatively long-awaited Limited Run collection of the Gex Trilogy is the perfect way to try these titles on modern consoles. That being said, this is very much a time capsule of the late 90s context of the games with all that entails – good and bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gex Trilogy | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7voeA0cKjB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before going on to look at each of the three games individually, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the package as a whole. Limited Run are at pains to state that this is not a remake or remaster but instead uses their own Carbon Engine to present fully authentic versions of each game, albeit with quality of life improvements such as widescreen and analogue controls for 2 and 3. Saving is also improved, but does need to be done manually so make sure you don’t rely on the modern convenience of autosave. These are welcome improvements, but the end result is more like emulation than anything more involved and this has garnered some negative responses from buyers and fans. I knew this was the case going in and so am judging the collection based on what it is rather than any great Gexpectations. That being said, the lack of the Game Boy and N64 versions being included in the bundle is disappointing when compared to the likes of the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/"> Turtles Cowabunga Collection</a>.</p>


<p>There are a range of Gextras (Limited Run’s pun, though one I thoroughly approve of) included such as trailers, artwork, and a soundtrack player. These are nice inclusions, but feel a little clunky – the music player in particular is difficult to use. A better alternative would have been a separate soundtrack download as is the case with many collector’s editions. Looking back at the print and TV ads for the games is certainly illuminating in a nostalgic way and sets the scene for the lad’s mag and celebrity culture they were written to cater to.</p>


<p>With the context set, let’s turn to the games. First up is the 2D original Gex which is a landmark title having first been released on the 3D0 in 1995. Billed as the first 32-bit platformer it certainly turned heads back in the day, but not far enough to rescue a doomed system. Pretty soon after it was ported to PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, and it’s the former version that’s included here.</p>
<p>All that history in min,d I should probably talk about the game itself, but it’s honestly awful. Floaty controls, an overly large sprite and confusing level design all combine to make a title that is difficult to enjoy. If you do try it in order to experience the full series then at least there is a rewind function similar to most emulation programs (familiar if you’ve used the Switch Online systems) to help make it past some of the most frustrating and annoying sections. Trust me, you’ll be using this a lot.</p>

<p>With that Gextremely annoying first title out of the way things take a turn for the better. Gex: Enter the Gecko is a very traditional 3D platformer which clearly takes a great deal of influence from the likes of Mario 64 and especially Rare collectathons. Both PAL and NTSC versions are included in the package and I opted to play the European titles for the Gexclusive voice acting. The second game features the silky tones of legendary lothario Leslie Philips which makes for some entertaining incongruities as he quotes now dated cultural references such as “It’s like I’ve woken up in Boy George’s pants!”</p>
<p>Traversal through the game takes the familiar route of a hub world with portals to levels in which multiple objectives can be completed. Doing so unlocks remotes which in turn open up more levels and boss battles. While you don’t need to collect every remote to finish the game there is an Gextra ending scene in each game if you do so apparently (although they seemed to play for me without having done so). Every level also has Gexclusive collectables and gathering enough also awards a remote. As you work through the game you’ll visit a range of worlds inspired by TV and film including classic horror, kung fu movies and Looney Tunes cartoons. Gex has different costumes for each world, but these are entirely cosmetic in this title aside from a memorable boss fight where Gex gets to act out your T-Gex fantasies and fight as a kaiju.</p>

<p>The third game in the trilogy, Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, takes all the mechanics and systems from the second and improves on them. The hub world makes another appearance, although this time it’s a secret agent base for Gex who is now voiced by Danny John Jules of Red Dwarf fame. While the more modern voice acting is a much better fit for the sassy lizard, there are still the same dated references and parts that have not aged well. Chief among these is the inclusion of a Baywatch babe as Agent Xtra – Marliece Andrada, also known for the epic Playboy babes of Baywatch. Her appearances are mostly restricted to cringey video calls in which Gex gets to make some of the most inappropriate lines this side of an 80s Bond movie. The ending of the game famously suggests an altercation between the two heroes that the Angry Video Game Nerd was not Gexpecting. A Wild West level in which Gex rides a donkey also includes a caricature of the lizard as a Gexican that wouldn’t pass the sniff test nowadays.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gex Trilogy is a good window into the history of gaming and the 3D games are still fun collectathon platformers, albeit with all the camera and control issues of the originals, and the awful 2D original I never want to play again. I would have liked to see a more Gexpansive remaster, and the result may not be entirely Gexceptional, but offers enough Gexperience to give you the kind of Gexual healing that only true nostalgia can provide.	</p></div>

            <p>Naughty Dog have released a new mode for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> that lets you play out the events of the story in chronological order. Nobody who has ever read a single book can understand why.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby’s motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," say the studio in a<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/"> post introducing the new mode</a>. "While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II’s themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>That important question which nobody asked. But who knows. Maybe this is great news to all those fans of The Last Of Us who dislike it when those UGH annoying storytellers at Naughty Dog do not adhere to the laws of temporal physics, telling another one of their bloody stories, but in the wrong direction. </p>
<p>"Through the new Chronological mode," say Naughty Dog, "we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more."</p>
<p>This is ominous behaviour and I do not agree with it, even if I am morbidly curious to see how batshittedly unhinged this makes the story of the game feel. Even the PlayStation's marketing spiel says that "Part II’s story is so meticulously put together" and they don't recommend this mode to new players. It might be an almost apologetic tone, were it not immediately followed by the other feature of this update: the ability to have Joel and Tommy cosplay as the Drake brothers from Uncharted.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Naughty Dog call their new chronological mode "a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter." And I suppose that might be true. Imagine if Christopher Nolan released Dunkirk: The Chronological Cut. Imagine if Memento went forwards. Imagine Casablanca, but with Paris right at the start. Imagine 100 Years Of Solitude but cut up into strips of paper and sellotaped back into "proper" order. Are you drunk, Naughty Dog? You already made this game twice. Get back to work on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-are-making-a-sci-fi-bounty-hunter-game-called-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Akira-inspired space game</a>, and stop upsetting the entire internet. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-gets-new-mode-nobody-asked-for]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Have you recently lost a vehicle or item in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> in a fashion that wasn't your fault? If so, you may be entitled to in-game compensation from developers Funcom, who've said sorry for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> patch "oversight" that wiped out "an unfortunate amount" of bases and gear.</p>
<p>You won't even have to enlist the services of a friendly neighbourhood Lionel Hutz or Saul Goodman either, DA's devs are already working to send out replacement stuff to affected folks. They've also pledged to tackle the cheating and item loss due to bugs that've been plaguing the game since launch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this is outlined in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/">developer update post</a> Funcom have put live this fine morning, providing some nice June 9th breakfast reading. It kicks off with the Funcom team, including Dune: Awakening's Joel Bylos, saying sorry for technical missteps while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game">working to rejig the Deep Desert</a> from PvP-only to a thing that also has a bunch of PvE zones.</p>
<p>"On <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-latest-patch-takes-aim-at-pvp-border-campers-and-dishes-out-some-extra-landsraad-rewards">Monday the 7th of July</a>, we patched out a layout change to the Deep Desert which caused several areas of the PvE Deep Desert to become PvP enabled," they wrote, "This was an oversight in our development process and internal communications, which led to people suffering an unfortunate amount of lost bases and equipment. This change was intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sleepers,<br>We’re aware of the issues affecting the game and have been working hard to address them.<br>We’d like to take a moment to share more details.<br>We sincerely apologize for the bumps along the way and thank you for your continued support.<a href="https://t.co/72G2LAorGK">https://t.co/72G2LAorGK</a> <a href="https://t.co/6hPCsQY1ZE">pic.twitter.com/6hPCsQY1ZE</a></p>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1942849463652872694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As well as making changes to their processes in the hopes of preventing this sort of thing from happening again, Funcom are working to "reimburse" affected players with vehicles and gear. The devs say "reimbursed materials, items, and vehicle components" should rock up in these players' claim rewards tab by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Alongside that, the studio say they're stepping up wider efforts to make sure folks get back any vehicles that end up being banished to the great worm void by bugs, something they say they "lacked the tooling and logging" to start doing right from launch. If your Ornithopter's gone walkies to the bug dimension, you can submit a ticket in-game that'll be added to the big pile that's now being worked through.</p>
<p>Finally, Funcom say their anti-exploit team are taking aim at eliminating all of the cheating and hacking that's frustrated folks playing properly so far. "Over the next few patches, they will be introducing additional efforts to prevent exploits by increasing security on several client/server communication layer, performing additional penetration testing against common attack vectors, and auditing our item and inventory systems to make sure they are resistant to item duplication," the devs wrote. </p>
<p>So, there you go. Funcom are on the case. Tell the suited sandworm you put through Harkonnen law school to stop shuffling papers in its teeth.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear]]></content:encoded>

<p>From <strong>9th July 2025 (today!) until 22nd July</strong>, the Pipe Tour is back for its second rerun following its introduction in 2023 and first rerun in 2024. So why is this such a big deal? Well, it's the only place you can experience <strong>Piranha Plant Pipeline</strong>, a track specially created for Mario Kart Tour that can't be played elsewhere.</p>
<p>In fact, it's the only new course from Tour that wasn't included in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, and it certainly isn't available in Mario Kart World either. So if you want to experience it, you'll need to get in on the action while the Pipe Tour is in session.</p>
<p>Mario Kart Tour ceased introducing new content in 2023 following the Anniversary Tour. All subsequent tours, including the current Pipe Tour, recycle previous content.</p>

<p><em>Big thanks goes to community member Grumblevolcano for bringing this to our attention.

            <p>We’ve already posted about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-this-austerely-beautiful-moonbase-management-game-your-only-choices-will-be-impossible-ones">one cursed moonbase game</a> this week, but I am a creature of multitudes and always have room in my heart for another - particularly when it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunar-software-explain-routine">been in development</a> for almost as long as I’ve been posting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> is still alive, baby! Development team Lunar Software have finally posted an update about their first-person 80s-themed space horror, which had Craig Pearson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deserves-some-buzz-routine-is-amnesia-on-the-moon">rhapsodising about Kubrickian smoothies back in 2012</a>. Let's all celebrate by re-watching the last trailer.</p> <!--more-->

<p>2012! Why, it’s quite likely that <em>you</em>, dear reader, were born after this project entered development. If that’s the case, I don’t want to hear about it. Do not comment upon this article. Leave me to chew over my memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>. Do not sadden me with such bright-eyed and bushy-tailed observations as “oh wow, a triple-A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>”. Do not ask me to explain the 1980s. Hush now, go Tik a Tok or something.</p>
<p>While much-changed over the years, Routine remains a game about exploring a lunar colony that has succumbed to a creepy robot uprising. You get a handheld scanner that looks like an original Macintosh and seemingly avails you little against the saw-toothed sentinels that stalk these creaking corridors. The base appears quite capacious and (pre-droid apocalypse, anyway) cosmopolitan. As described in Lunar Software’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/503954252358484700">latest Steam post</a>, it includes a plaza where you’ll find tourist attractions, an arcade, and a mall. The post also digs into what’s been going on since the developers teamed up with publisher Raw Fury in 2022.</p>

<p>“Working on Routine has always been a huge undertaking for a team of our size and because of that, felt it was important to keep our heads down and focus entirely on finishing Routine,” the developers write. “But we are aware of the interest in our work and we are sorry for any frustration that this may have caused.</p>
<p>“In short, Routine is still very much in active development, and we are beginning to approach the finish line for the game. We’ve learned a lot from past experiences, one of those is not to commit to a release window before we’re absolutely sure we can hit it. However, we’re confident that we’ll be able to share more news on that front soon.”</p>
<p>The game is the work of a core team of three, with additional contributors coming online at intervals. When they announced it, Lunar Software had Doom composer Mick Gordon on the books, but according to the new Steam post, he left the project in July 2024 due to “conflicts in his schedule”. Nonetheless, “Mick created many outstanding audio assets that will be featured in the final game and provided invaluable audio direction for Routine” – the new audio designer and team will build on his labours.</p>
<p>When Routine was re-announced at Summer Game Fest in 2022, it had to worry about comparisons with fellow Alien-spawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fort-solis">Fort Solis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. Neither of those turned out to be very good. Fingers crossed Routine will be all the better for its marathon spell in development. Fingers crossed these promises of an imminent release announcement won't become - well, you know.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gorgeous-alien-style-space-horror-routine-is-finally-nearing-the-finish-line-despite-a-key-departure]]></content:encoded>

		<p>91Act has announced that the side scrolling roguelike BlazBlue Entropy Effect will launch globally on July 22nd for Android and iOS, following an earlier release in China which saw the game get downloaded six million times. BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a spin off from the BlazBlue fighting series, taking the combat style and action from that to embed it in a different genre. The game is available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273430/BlazBlue_Entropy_Effect/">Steam</a>, where it has over 25,000 reviews and sits at very positive.</p>

<p>If you want to pre-register to get BlazBlue Entropy Effect at launch, you can follow the links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blazblue-entropy-effect/id6742527094">BlazBlue Entropy Effect on the App&nbsp;Store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actgames.bbee.gl">BlazBlue Entropy Effect – Apps on Google Play</a></li>
</ul>
<p>BlazBlue Entropy Effect has its own original story separate to the mainline games, with Es, Mai or Hibiki available to play as for free. You can unlock further characters like Ragna the Bloodedge, Noel Vermillion, Hazama, and Bullet by using in app purchases that are called Analyzer. You need one or two of these for each character, and when you unlock enough you get the crossover character ICEY for no additional charge.</p>

			<p>There's no doubt that, even with all of Epic's efforts over the last few years, Steam remains by far the biggest online gaming store on PC. Not only that, but it also appears to be more convenient for game developers, even with Valve demanding 30% of everyone's revenue. In contrast, Epic only takes 12% (and, starting last month, only after they have passed the first million in revenue, which is completely free of charge).</p>



<p>Why is that the case? <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/06/03/most-people-who-buy-your-game-wont-play-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Steam and games industry analyst Chris Zukowski</a>, Valve successfully cultivated a user base of hoarders who buy games they don't actually play, for the most part.</p>



<p><em>Valve cracked the problem that Netflix was struggling with: how do you sell to people who have so much entertainment at their fingertips that they don’t have enough hours in the day to play and watch it all. Valve basically added infinite hours to a gamer’s day, it is a theoretical future day where gamers might someday spend hours playing your game (but let’s be honest, won’t).</em></p>



<p><em>The reason game developers are willing to give Valve 30% of their revenue is because the Steam marketplace is packed with super gamers who throw money at games they have no intention of playing. When I ran a survey of games that participated in Steam Next Fest, I found that for the median game most people only wishlist a game without even playing the demo. THE DEMO IS FREE! If players are so interested in the game, why don’t they play it!</em></p>



<p>We have one such example among our staff, actually. Our own <a href="https://wccftech.com/author/chriswray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Wray</a> owns 6,062 games on Steam, but only launched around 20% of them, as you can see <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561197977871270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SteamDB</a>. Needless to say, his backlog is the stuff of legends. Sure, he didn't buy all the games (some we provided for the reviews), but that's only a minor percentage. For the most part, he purchased them on his own.</p>



<p>Steam does have some of the deepest discounts available for PC games, such as those seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the current Summer Sale</a>. By the way, that's ending tomorrow, just in case you're looking to buy some games you're never going to play.</p>



<p>On a more serious note, are you also afflicted with this hoarding disease? Vote in the poll and let us know below!</p>



<div id="democracy-1421" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1421,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Do you regularly buy games on Steam that you end up never playing?</strong></p></div>

		<p>Jelly Troops has been revealed by developer Nukenin Co and publisher Phoenixx Inc, with the game looking like a good, casual real time strategy title focused around capturing flags.

<p><em>“Jelly Troops&nbsp;is as deep as it is cute. The inviting blue-pink aesthetic contrasts against very tense gameplay,”</em> says Waken, solo developer of Jelly Troops. <em>“The mind games are near-endless. We can’t wait to watch the meta develop over time!”</em></p>
<p>In Jelly Troops, players will need to literally grow their armies by planting Magic Fruits at base, with these fruits producing jellies. These Magic Fruits are dotted around the map, so this in itself becomes a fight for resources. It won’t be as simple as grabbing the fruits though, as powerful golems also patrol the maps. These golems can kill in one hit, so you need to find ways to move them out of your way and make them an inconvenience for your enemy. To win, you need to capture the flag and there are different approaches to this. The most obvious is by having a bigger army and overwhelming defences, but you can also send in smaller groups to sneak in and steal the flag. Various power ups will either help or hinder, with powers such as invisibility, lightning strikes, and summoning guardians all having their own impact on how things will unfold.</p>

<p>Jelly Troops has been announced for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch, with a release date of September 17th.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-now-last-five-seasons-after-immensely-surprising-popularity-say-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explosive popularity of the Fallout TV show</a>, fans started clamoring for new games in the beloved post-apocalyptic franchise. Of course, that was far from easy to accomplish for Bethesda Game Studios, which had just about started production on the long-awaited The Elder Scrolls VI. T<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here were some hints from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> that Bethesda was considering how to fast-track new games. Still, Bethesda's Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> shortly afterward that the games wouldn't be rushed out to meet some arbitrary deadline, like the show's second season.</p>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lap5F8SnoXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode of the Friends Per Second podcast on the Skill Up YouTube channel</a>, VideoGamesChronicles' Jordan Middler teased that there are indeed multiple Fallout projects in the works, including 'the one everyone wants'. However, as we already knew, the next mainline entry is still far away.</p>



<p><em>Fallout is the big one. I cannot believe that they didn't immediately start work on a Fallout 5, because Todd's not going to make it. Todd is not going to make it. He's not going to make the game. May well make it to that point of life, hopefully at the time of recording, but when he's done with the next Elder Scrolls, I can fully see him being like, "Okay, I'm done. I'm an older guy now." There are multiple Fallout projects in development, including, as far as I'm aware, that one you're all wanting. But it's not far enough along to say anything that is like, "You're going to be playing this game anytime soon." Fallout 5 should have been day one.</em></p>



<p>Now, regarding Howard's involvement, Meddler is definitely speculating. As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason to believe he wouldn't be involved in Fallout 5. He is around 55 years old, and The Elder Scrolls VI will likely launch by 2028, leaving him with enough time in his career to make another big game - the next Fallout installment, which we already know will follow TES VI.</p>



<p>As for the other projects, one is most likely the Fallout 3 remaster that was originally discovered during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial. Another project could be a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, especially since the Amazon Prime Video show's season two <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is heading to Vegas</a>. There's been some speculation that Obsidian <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be handed the reins of a full-fledged New Vegas sequel</a>, but that rumor is over three and a half years old now and Obsidian is very busy with its own projects.</p>

			<p>Epic Games president and majority stakeholder Tim Sweeney announced that his company has settled the antitrust lawsuit it <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in September 2024</a> against Samsung. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1942259929865420855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>We’re dismissing our court case against Samsung following the parties’ discussions. We are grateful that Samsung will address Epic’s concerns.</em></p>



<p>Epic's concerns were related to Samsung's introduction of the Auto Blocker security feature, which launched with the One UI 6.0 update. Auto Blocker was originally added in October 2023 as an opt-in feature that would disable app installation from sources other than the Samsung Galaxy Store and the Google Play Store. However, in July 2024, Auto Blocker became enabled by default. Epic Games stated:</p>



<p><em>Auto Blocker defaulting to “on” requires an exceptionally onerous 21 step process to download an app outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store, mirroring Google’s “Unknown Sources” process with multiple steps and scare screens. Auto Blocker is the first time that Samsung has imposed additional friction on consumers who try to get apps outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store.</em></p>



<p><em>Auto Blocker undermines the jury’s unanimous decision in Epic v. Google, specifically that “Google entered into one or more agreements that unreasonably restrained trade in a relevant antitrust market” including “Agreements with OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] that sell mobile devices”.</em></p>



<p>Epic Games is, of course, referring to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic win in the anticompetitive lawsuit against Google</a>, dating back to December 11, 2023, when Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Google had violated antitrust laws by maintaining the Play Store as the dominant storefront for Android. This included making deals to ensure that apps would be published exclusively through the Play Store and requiring that the Play Store be installed on third-party devices. The Judge also ordered Google to allow alternative app stores on the Android system and temporarily prohibited them from offering monetary incentives to developers who release exclusively on the Play Store.</p>



<p>The Epic Games Store eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on Android and iOS</a> (although only in Europe in the latter case, at least for now) on August 16, 2024, following Epic's strenuous legal efforts against Google and Apple.</p>
