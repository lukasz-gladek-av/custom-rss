            <p>It looks like Unknown Worlds is posting sneaky screenshots of Subnautica 2 in the original game.</p>
<p>Whilst Unknown Worlds is being, ahem, coi, eagle-eyed fans think they've discovered sneaky peeks of Subnautica 2 in the first (and currently only) game via its time capsule feature.</p>

<p>Originally it wasn't clear where these mysterious images were coming from, but moderators of the Subnautica subreddit have since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1e4vn00/comment/leuop67/">confirmed</a> "screenshot[s are] from the upcoming Subnautica 2" and not fan-made mods. </p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then,this has sent players back under the waves on the hunt for more.</p>
<p>Here's just a few of the images discovered so far:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Time is one of the great enemies of even the best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. It’s often hard enough to get a group of people together in the same space for a gaming session, doubly so if you need to find several hours to play the latest heavy, epic title. So there’s an instant market for faster-playing games. They’re also great for family play or for casually breaking out for a quick game before you head out for the evening. But as you’ll soon find out from our list of suggestions, small and fast doesn’t mean light or boring: from timer-based games to hilarious <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games">dexterity games</a>, you’ll soon discover that fast often equals fun. </p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Quick-Playing Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#scout">Scout</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#5-min-dungeon">5-Minute Dungeon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#fuse">Fuse</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#kites">Kites</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#klask">Klask</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#strike">Strike</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#sail">Sail!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#coup">Coup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#love-letter">Love Letter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#draftosaurus">Draftosaurus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games#ticket">Ticket to Ride: London and New York</a></li></ul><h2 id="scout">Scout</h2><div id="195820" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scout</h3></p></div><p>Ignore the pointless circus theme; this is a fantastic little set collection card game with a devious twist: You can’t change the order of cards in your hand. Nevertheless, you have to work with what you’ve been dealt to try and beat whatever’s in the middle of the table, with higher value cards beating lower value, and longer runs and sets beating shorter ones. </p><p>If you can’t – as is often the case – the person who played those cards gets a point, and you have to pick a card up, making it easier for the next player and allowing you to slot it into your hand where you like, creating new combos for future plays. It’s fast, furious and surprisingly hard to master, with timing your best plays properly critical for success. No wonder it was a nominee for the prestigious <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiel des Jahres</a> award the year it was released. </p><h2 id="5-min-dungeon">5-Minute Dungeon</h2><div id="198563" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>5 Minute Dungeon</h3></p></div><p>One way to ensure a game is quick playing is to run it to an absolutely punishing timer, which is how 5-Minute Dungeon manages to do exactly what it says on the box. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">Build a deck</a> of dungeon challenges, pick a character, start the timer, and then it’s down to the adventuring party, working together, to defeat the dungeon in real-time. </p><p>Each trap or monster needs a particular set of symbols to banish, but you don’t have time to coordinate your plays properly, leading to a desperate slapping down of wasted cards, cries of woe, and forgetting of special character abilities in the heat of the moment. You’ll need to try and slow down just enough to chart a path through the chaos while still keeping up with the clock, and finding a moment to delight in the hilarious artwork and fantasy meme riffs. </p><h2 id="fuse">Fuse</h2><div id="198564" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Fuse</h3></p></div><p>Another timed game, this one sets the clock at 10 minutes, which your group must use to try and defuse as many bombs as possible from a deck of bomb cards. On your turn you’ll draw and roll as many dice, which come in different colors, as there are players, then discuss and divide them up while the timer ticks down. Each bomb card comes with a dizzying array of color and number requirements for dice to defuse it, from simple addition or equality to actually making stacks of dice in particular combinations. </p><p>The uncertainty of drawing and rolling never fails to give this game a thrilling edge, while probability ensures there’s some good strategy to doling out the dice. If you want to up the ante, there are some super-hard bombs to shuffle in for extra challenge.</p><h2 id="kites">Kites</h2><div id="198565" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kites - Time to Fly</h3></p></div><p>A whole different take on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> real-time mechanism, Kites comes with several sand timers of different lengths and colors, which represent different kites that you’ve got to keep in the air. On your turn, you play a card and flip any timers that match its colored icons. Your goal, as a group, is simply to stop any one of the timers from running out. </p><p>This is much easier said than done, and the game has an extraordinary spinning plates feeling as you desperately speed round the table, trying to flip timers trickling out their very last grains. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can add more colors and special challenge cards to keep your game in the air for longer, just like the titular kites.</p><h2 id="klask">Klask</h2><div id="197673" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Klask</h3></p></div><p>Possibly the shortest game on the entire list, with almost no setup time and games that can be over in seconds. But that’s no problem when it’s so addictive you’ll want to go again right away! Klask is a simple dexterity game where you use a magnet to steer a paddle that knocks a little plastic ball around the playing area, aiming to get it into your opponent’s goal while defending your own.</p><p>To add even more skill and amusement value to an already breakneck experience, there are also magnetic obstacles to avoid, lest they stick to your paddle and make your shots even more unpredictable. It’s such a fast, fun, fickle game that you’ll be using that short play time to host mini-tournaments.</p><h2 id="strike">Strike</h2><div id="198566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Strike Dice Game</h3></p></div><p>Strike is a fast-paced push-your-luck game that gets even faster the more players choose to tempt fate. Everyone starts with a fistful of dice and, on your turn, you throw one into the “arena”, an oval box insert, possibly aiming to knock existing dice there around. What you’re looking for are matching numbers, which you can add to your dice collection, ending your turn.</p><p>If you don’t get any matches, you can pass or continue throwing, which ups your chance of matching but also risks leaving more options for others if you don’t. Each dice has an X instead of a 1, meaning it’s removed from the game instantly, and the last player left with dice wins. It’s an addictive combination of luck, dexterity and playing the odds and once it’s reeled you in there are tournament rules for extended play.</p><h2 id="sail">Sail!</h2><div id="198567" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sail</h3></p></div><p>Most folks are familiar with the common playing card mechanic of trick-taking, which really helps this two-player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a> run faster. You’re working together to steer a pirate ship through dangerous seas, pursued by a hungry kraken. The symbols you pair on your trick might inch your craft forward, injure the sea monster, cause it to attack you, or do nothing at all. </p><p>But you’re not allowed to tell your shipmate what’s in your hand, only pass one card to them at the start of each turn, which has to try and speak volumes as to your plans. This makes every single play a mini-drama of tension and release in an overall arc of terror as you try to balance tricks won, movement and keeping the beast at bay. With six scenarios of punishing difficulty, this is a lot of game in a small box.</p><h2 id="coup">Coup</h2><div id="197941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Coup Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Bluffing on hidden roles is a great way to fit a lot of game into a small package, and Coup give you the biggest bluffing bang in the smallest box. Each player gets two role cards which give special powers like taking extra coins or cheap assassinations. The aim is to knock out your opponent’s roles, putting them out of the game. </p><p>The genius twist is that, whatever roles you're dealt, you can execute any power in the game, providing no-one catches you at it. Most roles have the chance to block one another, which is fine until it becomes clear that someone is claiming one they don't have. Then all hell breaks loose as the accusations start flying and no-one wants to be first to make the actual challenge. Because if you're wrong, it's you that looses out and not the target.</p><h2 id="love-letter">Love Letter</h2><div id="198214" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Love Letter</h3></p></div><p>Another bluffing game but with much more dynamic roles, Love Letter sees the players competing to get the titular epistle to the princess, who is also the highest-valued card. You start with a card and, on your turn, draw another and choose which to play. Each card has a number and a special effect, two of which knock other players out of the round based on whether you can either guess what card they’re holding or beat the value of that card against yours. </p><p>Other cards protect you, let you swap cards with another player or peek at their held card. The last two players left compare card values, and the highest wins. It’s a devious little game of social engineering, just like real courtly courtship, and while the rules suggest you play the superfast rounds multiple times to determine an overall winner, it’s also easily fun enough to play a single quick-fire hand.  </p><h2 id="draftosaurus">Draftosaurus</h2><div id="198568" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Draftosaurus</h3></p></div><p>Games of Draftosaurs begin with players grabbing a handful of dino-meeples – which are cute enough to justify owning this game on their own – at random from a bag. Then, you take it turns to roll the dice and place a dinosaur on your dino-zoo playmat. The dice-roller can place where they want, but all other players have to obey the rule on the dice face. There are a number of different enclosures, each with their own simple placement rules and scoring opportunities. Then, everyone passes the remaining dinosaurs to your left and repeat until all the pieces have been placed, and the scores tallied to find a winner.</p><p>The combination of random roll and passing on gives the game some interesting teeth as you ponder whether to risk pieces in higher-scoring options or keep back something your neighbor is collecting. Easy to learn and fast to play, it’s a quick filler that can easily end up being popular enough to play all evening.</p><h2 id="ticket">Ticket to Ride: London / New York</h2><div id="198569" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride London</h3></p></div><div id="198570" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride New York</h3></p></div><p>The enormously successful Ticket to Ride franchise is based on players collecting sets of colored cards and playing them to claim routes on a map.  Most of your points come from tickets that you score if you connect their printed destinations, but fail to complete the route, and you’ll lose those points instead. </p><p>It’s a brilliant recipe that forces you to balance the desire to collect against the risk of other players slapping down the cards before you. These two variants keep that addictive core gameplay loop, but make it quick by giving you only a tiny, cramped board to play on, leaving you feeling like you’re scuffling in a phone booth. Each has its own unique twist to the recipe, with London offering bonus points for completing districts and New York for linking up tourist hotspots. </p><h2>How to Speed Up Slower Games</h2><p>Medium-length games can become quick-playing games with a few house rules, or tweaks to your setup and your play style, although all the players will have to be on board with the changes, and you’ll need to go through it with them beforehand. Here are some hints on places you can make up time.</p><p>Firstly, you can mimic what a lot of the games on this list already do and add a timer, limiting the amount of time a player has to complete their turn. Some people will absolutely hate this, but others won’t mind, and a few will even thrive in the pressure cooker environment that results. This is a particularly good trick for games that have a negotiation element, as the timer ups the skill required to communicate your deals as concisely as possible.</p><p>A surprising number of games are also amenable to turn overlap, especially ones that have limited player interaction. While one player is collecting the resources earned during their turn, for example, the next player can begin working on theirs. You can overlap at any point of the turn where parts of the game that might impact the next player - like cards available in a market, say - aren’t changing. In low-interaction games, that can be a surprising amount of time saved.</p><p>Finally, it can also help to ban mobile devices, and even things like pencils and paper, at the table. This ensures everyone is focussed on what needs to be done in the game at all times, not spending time taking notes, or - worse - scrolling social media, and can actually improve the atmosphere and sociability around the game. And if you can’t do that, you can consider embracing it and playing online instead, using a service like <u>BoardGameArena</u> to take care of all that painstaking setup and administration time for you.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-took-this-long-because-bioware-wanted-to-get-it-right-game-has-700-characters.939033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-took-this-long-because-bioware-wanted-to-get-it-right-game-has-700-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>BioWare attended San Diego Comic-Con 2024 to discuss <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and showcase the voice actors chosen for the upcoming action RPG.</p>
<p>While there, Creative Director John Epler and Creative Performance Director Ashley Barlow spoke briefly to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilgaurd-took-so-long-as-bioware-wanted-to-make-sure-we-got-this-one-right-that-and-it-takes-a-long-time-to-record-700-characters-and-140000-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamesradar</a>. Epler explained why Dragon Age: The Veilguard took so long to make:</p>
<p><em>We had other projects going on at BioWare as well. We wanted to make sure we got this one right. It's the best version that it could possibly be.</em></p>
<p>Ashley Barlow added:</p>
<p><em>We started casting five years ago. The team, the talent has been on for five years. It takes a long time to record 700 characters, you know - 80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks. It just takes time to make good.</em></p>
<p>That's a lot of characters, but some of them will probably have only one or two voice lines. Overall, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will have more voice lines than its predecessor (2014's Inquisition), which had 88K, but still way less than other games. Red Dead Redemption 2 had over 500K voice lines, and Starfield had over 250K. Larian never provided a fixed number for Baldur's Gate 3, but it's a safe bet that it has way more voice lines, considering that there are over 140 hours of cutscenes and around 1.3 million words in the award-winning cRPG.</p>
<p>In another video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S94JyK-F8KA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with The Gamer</a>, John Epler discussed whether reading comics and novels is necessary before playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><em>One of the things we do try to make sure with the games is that you don't need to have consumed all the ancillary content to understand what's going on. Still, there's characters from the comics, especially The Missing, the most recent one, that show up in the game. One is a pair of characters we've talked about before, Evka Ivo and Antoine, two Grey Wardens. In general, we just love to make sure that there's a continuity. Again, if you don't read the comics or the books, you still know what's going on, but if you do, it gives you that extra level of texture. Honestly, the same is true even for the previous games. We want to make sure that if you play the previous games you get that extra context, that extra texture, but also we want to allow players who don't necessarily consume all that ancillary media to really get into the story of the game and understand what's going on.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't be shown at Gamescom 2024</a>. Despite the absence, according to EA, the game is still slated for a Fall 2024 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford says news about the next game in the Borderlands series will come "sooner rather than later".</p>
<p>Gearbox – which is now a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">subsidiary of Take-Two</a> after being sold by Embracer last year – hasn't yet confirmed another Borderlands game is on the way, but Pitchford says he hasn't "done a good enough job of hiding the fact that we're working on something [...] and [he] thinks people that love Borderlands are going to be very excited".</p>

<p>"These are fuzzy words, but sooner rather than later, we're going to be talking about what we've been working on, and I can't wait.</p>
<p>"I think I'm genetically made to try and create joy and happiness, and build entertainment. I love movies and I love video games, I love entertainment," he added.</p>
<p>"So I'm grateful that we have so many great things coming with Borderlands, and I can't wait to talk about the stuff that we're working on with our fans."</p>
<p>The Borderlands movie - which Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has, perhaps prematurely, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-start-of-cinematic-universe-randy-pitchford-says">the start of a "Borderlands Cinematic Universe"</a> - sees Cate Blanchett's infamous outlaw Lillith returning to the planet Pandora in search of a missing girl. Along the way she teams up with former mercenary Roland (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kevin-hart-to-play-roland-in-borderlands-movie">Kevin Hart</a>), pre-teen demolitionist Tiny Tina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/young-gamora-actress-to-play-tiny-tina-in-borderlands-movie">Ariana Greenblatt</a>), her protector Krieg (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/florian-munteanu-viktor-drago-in-creed-2-is-krieg-in-the-borderlands-movie">Florian Munteanu</a>), Padorian archaeologist Tannis (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>), and robot Claptrap (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a>), uncovering an "unimaginable power".</p>

            <p>An uncut eight-minute video of Astro Bot has popped up online.</p>
<p>The footage – recorded at ChinaJoy2024 – shows off the game's combat and platforming premise, as well as a delightful boss battle with an octopus in scuba gear (nope, I don't understand, either) and boxing gloves.</p>
<p>You can see the action for yourself in the video below:</p>

<p>Astro Bot is set to release exclusively on PS5 on 6th September, 2024.</p>
<p>"It feels bold to say so early on, but if the demo's quality is representative of the full game, Astro Bot looks like a strong candidate for the top spot on my own game of the year list," Digital Foundry's John <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hands-on-with-astro-bot-creative-beautiful-and-authentically-playstation">wrote</a> after a little hands-on time with it last month.</p>
<p>"Astro's Playroom certainly shows a similar level of polish and fun game design, so I'm optimistic that the full release will be equally good if not even better.</p>
<p>In fact, if Team Asobi can execute on the vision the demo provides, this might be one of the best 3D platforming games ever made. There's a huge amount here that's unexpected, imaginative and absolutely joyous, and I can't wait to play the full release.</p>

            <p>
Just up the road from Newport, in the countryside off the M40, a troupe of actors and backstage boffins are gearing up for a fresh season of strangeness. 
</p>
<p>
Key of Dreams is billed as a unique blend of interactive theatre, puzzle solving and branching narrative spread over 24 hours in Treowen, a historic 17th century Welsh manor house you've likely seen on Doctor Who. Within its walls, Key of Dreams mixes the location's real-world history with weird fiction tales inspired by the likes of MR James and HP Lovecraft, in an experience that allows guests to decide the fates of its various characters and guide how its intertwining storylines evolve.
</p>
<p>
Unlike other interactive theatre performances, such as those from the acclaimed Punchdrunk, Key of Dreams is designed to be a more influenceable experience, with less of an emphasis on following tightly scripted narrative in favour of something more open world. Launched last year to positive reviews and an endorsement from Neil Patrick Harris, a handful of guests have already made repeat trips, taking advantage of the fact Key of Dreams' storylines are swapped in and out to keep its mysteries fresh, with an array of endings so no two visits are quite the same. 
</p>
<p>
It all sounds ambitious, even for creators well-versed in the complexities of branching narratives, and yet its production company Lemon Difficult is still in its infancy. Five years ago, its founder and creative director Ivan Caric worked as a consultant for a telecoms company - until everything changed suddenly when his father died during Covid. 
</p>
<p>
"I had a reassessment, I guess is a gentle way of putting it," Caric tells me. "I had a bit of a breakdown." 
</p>
<p>
It was a moment to take stock, Caric says, and make a leap of faith to work on something closer to his personal interests: role-playing games, immersive theatre and - when he was a bit younger - running around playing LARP. 
</p>

"I've done role-playing games, I love video games and I love immersive theatre," he says, chatting with me via video call. "I wanted to create something that was an intersection of all of those, that took bits from each and yet was enjoyable for anyone not just into immersive theatre but also escape rooms, gaming, puzzles. 
</p>
<p>
"Lots of immersive theatre doesn't get what makes a good game," he continues, "and that's not necessarily a bad thing, they're just trying to achieve something different. Whereas I'm interested in the mechanics, and how they make people feel."

Key of Dreams has three main narrative pillars, each designed to appeal to various groups of visitors. Before each 24-hour session begins, players are invited to join one of several secret societies, which helps mix people together (though you can say no and join another with a friend if you so choose). Each group has its own goal, linking to the wider weird fiction mythos. Then there are the experience's NPCs, its cast of four actors who live in-role throughout, with their own personalities and backstories to discover, and goals you can help or hinder. Finally, there are stories involving puzzles within the house itself (which for Christmas this year will feature Dickensian festive horror tales, Caric tells me). 
</p>
<p>
"It's a collaborative and a competitive experience, because there are these groups which are in competition against each other," Caric says. "But because there's this investigative vibe - there's boards, red string - it does encourage cooperation." 
</p>
<p>
One of the key considerations for Lemon Difficult when engineering the experience was to make it something all guests - up to 30 at a time - can feel included within, rather than one where specific individuals end up being able to steer its outcome. Likewise, it is designed so that any guest who turns up determined not to engage won't spoil it for the rest. Typically, however, this isn't a problem.
</p>
<p>
"There's a guy called Matthew Pennington who runs the UK's biggest LARP," Caric says. "His background is database admin - and he treats his LARP as software that he runs on people. You're trying to encourage certain behaviours, rather than have concrete rules which say you can do this, you cannot do that. Obviously there are rules, there are certain things you're not allowed to do, but you can nudge people into certain behaviours that can result in the effect and in the world that you want. That's what we've tried to do."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously people are people, they're not software," Key of Dreams' lead writer Laura Langrish adds. "But by building the sense of tension, the weirdness, by changing the soundscapes, the light, it changes how they're feeling." People entering the experience quickly become caught up, she continues.
</p>
<p>
"If you take someone and tell them a weird story and say at the end they have to do a ritual, it's going to feel awkward," she says. "It just will. But when you've spent a whole day in the house with these objects, talking to people, when someone says 'you know what you have to do to end this story, it's your choice to do it', well..." 
</p>
<p>
Key of Dreams kicks off in the afternoon, when - like any good horror - things begin normally enough. But then stuff starts to get weird - "and then after that things go a bit batshit," Langrish teases. "There's kind of an informal tutorial to how the mechanics of it work, the people, and then you're off exploring the story, doing rituals, making terrible decisions," she says. "And by that point it's dark, you've got a lantern, and there's a conspiratorial element to it." The action continues through the evening - even during mealtimes, which include a seven-course banquet - before events are resolved after breakfast the following day. 
</p>
<p>
"The cost is the giant elephant in the room," Caric notes. Key of Dreams is not cheap. It's pitched as a luxury overnight immersive experience and priced accordingly, at £400 for a ticket, not including accommodation. Caric justifies the "value proposition" as being fair for a 24-hour experience with a high actor-to-guest ratio, four meals including the banquet, and the cost of the venue. Still, he accepts it is out of reach for many - and hopes to run a more affordable version in London next year.

<p>
"It's physically very demanding," Caric says of the actors involved. "They're basically there and in role for 12 to 14 hours, even when people aren't watching. And they have to react to how people behave. But because you have all this time to get to know them, you can befriend them, find out what they like and dislike. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not like a dating sim, though," Caric quickly adds. "You can't just discover they like this obscure thing, find that and suddenly they're your best friend. You build a relationship with them, because they're meant to be real people."
</p>
<p>
Lemon Difficult has worked with many of the same actors for a few years - including one person involved in the upcoming Return to Silent Hill movie. But the cast come from a variety of professional backgrounds, including another actor involved in re-enactment at stately homes, who supervises a puzzle where you smelt down lead.
</p>
<p>
"You can't really recruit for 'look, we're going to live in the same house for three weeks, how do we not kill each other?'" Caric says. "We've ended up with something of an extended family." This also helps with what Caric describes as "a tight budget", where the team work together to create their own props, or rely on the help of friends - such as a pal of Caric's who works as a software designer, who programmed the Raspberry Pi-based tech that connects to radios throughout the house.
</p>
<p>
Someone from Lemon Difficult's creative team, such as Caric or Langrish, is always on-site, overseeing how events progress while in character as a sinister lawyer ("think Wolfram &amp; Hart", Caric says). But in building the experience, the intent was that its actors get plenty of latitude to react organically along the way. "Being backstage is like being a GM who has lost control of the game," Langrish muses. "At any point there are 20-something players running around, you don't know where they are or what they know, and you've just got to trust the NPCs are doing their job."
</p>
<p>
So how do you write a story - or multiple intertwining stories - for a group of players with the freedom to uncover them all at their own pace? "Branching narrative is an understatement for what we do, but in some ways it's more complicated and in some ways it's less," Langrish says. "Ours is a lot more open world. It's a case of writing for the actors so they know how to react in lots of different scenarios: what they know about a scenario, how they should react, and how they should react to ensure guests have a good experience. In a video game, if you fail or die you just restart. Whereas we don't kill the guests."

<p>
Unravelling Key of Dreams' mysteries involves exploring Treowen's house and grounds, in a manner Langrish compares to that of Gone Home. "You're exploring a house through the objects within it, to learn about the people who were there but now aren't," she hints. These stories are created from a mix of weird fiction tales (one is a mash-up of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward by HP Lovecraft and The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, where you'll discover what went on through pieces of writing, pieces of wallpaper, and potion bottles), but also real history - which guests can continue looking into once they get home.  
</p>
<p>
The ability for guests to share knowledge and pool resources heightens the experience, Caric says, beyond what you might experience in a single-player story game. "Guest collaboration is really important, and it's our job and the actor's job to point people to others who may be investigating the same thing. It's all opt-in, and there are many ways to go about it - you can research, you can ask characters, and these all point to the same place."
</p>
<p>
"You can do all the legwork and feel very clever," Langrish says. "You can also just sit in the bar with a cocktail and get the same information spending four hours opening really fiendish puzzle boxes and get it as a narrative hidden in there. We had a couple who came along and solved things in those two different ways."
</p>
<p>
Investigative work and puzzles make up a core part of the experience, but Lemon Difficult is keen to ensure things never feel, well, too difficult. "Obviously there are things to collect, physical things to put together, paths to follow, there are those mechanics, but we really spend a lot of time thinking about how things will make people feel," Caric notes. "We don't want people to feel like they've lost. We want people to feel bewildered but not for too long.
</p>
<p>
"I'm playing Talos Principle 2 at the moment and there's a rush when you solve a puzzle after being slightly frustrated. Sometimes you need that frustration - but you don't want it to go on too long." It's here the experience's actors can help - or be persuaded to help - in character. "I love escape rooms, but I hate asking for clues as it makes me feel stupid," Caric continues, laughing. "Whereas we can see how people are getting on, and very gently nudge them towards clues in a way that feels seamless."
</p>
<p>
"Now we've done it, I'm confident in saying it's brilliant," Langrish says. "Before that, though, it was a terrifying thing. There is so much written for this show." Each of the actors have a 40-page document that acts as part script, part character history, as well as a spreadsheet that tracks how events can unfold. "Each of the five main story threads and each of the four characters all have different ways in which they can end," she explains.  "And how those nine different things end in the night then changes how the morning happens."
</p>
<p>
My time speaking to Caric and Langrish wraps up with them sharing more of the backstage work built into the experience, and the planning that happens before guests wake up the next day. But like Key of Dreams' many secrets, the machinery behind it all is best left unspoiled. This sounds like one to discover yourself.

                <p>Adamantium is coming to the MCU thanks to Captain America: Brave New World from an unlikely source--The Eternals. If you've ever been a Marvel comics fan, you know why this is big news. The fictional metal Vibranium has been a central element of the MCU since Captain America's shield first appeared, but that's because Marvel's most famous metal belonged to a character they couldn't use at the time.</p><p>As part of Marvel Studios' big San Diego Comic-Con panel, the studio is talking about the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World. Among the many details shared in the panel and trailer, this one stood out: Adamantium is coming to the MCU.</p><p>In Marvel comic books, Adamantium is the king of sci-fi metals. Captain America's shield is crafted from the material in the books, as is the body of Ultron (the primary antagonist of Avengers: Age of Ultron). But Adamantium is best know as the material coating the skeleton of Marvel's best-known and most profitable mutant, Wolverine.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this introduction is the source. Adamantium is being found for the first time in the solidified form of the Celestial that rose from the Earth in the South Pacific in the 2021 film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">The Eternals</a>. This is one of, if not <em>the</em> first mention of the Celestial since the movie released, aside from Easter eggs like the mention of "a giant statue of a man sticking out of the ocean" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-episode-2-9-easter-eggs-and-references-you-missed/2900-4284/" data-ref-id="2900-4284">in She-Hulk</a>.</p><p>For years, the X-Men and all mutants--including Wolverine--belonged to 20th Century Fox. With Disney's acquisition a few years back, the X-Men were back in the hands of Marvel proper, leading to Wolverine's debut in the just-released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine film</a>.</p><p>It would be easy to assume, then, that Deadpool &amp; Wolverine is the introduction of adamantium into the MCU. But Deadpool &amp; Wolverine isn't quite the same as a mainline MCU film. It acts as a sort of bridge between the Fox and Marvel Studios films, and takes place on Earths other than Earth-616 (Marvel's primary canonical Earth). The Wolverine in that movie also won't be the one introduced to the MCU. Thus, this acts as the official introduction of the metal into the main MCU--setting the stage for the day that Marvel Studios recasts the grumpiest X-Man and lets him go 'snikt' for the first time with his iconic claws.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer-breakdown-and-easter-eggs/2900-5589/" data-ref-id="2900-5589">Captain America: Brave New World</a> stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Captain America, and introduce both Giancarlo Esposito as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/giancarlo-esposito-confirmed-as-leader-of-the-serpent-society-for-captain-america-4/1100-6525357/" data-ref-id="1100-6525357">leader of the Serpent Society</a> and Harrison Ford as Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross. hits theaters on February 14, 2025, so take your beloved to go see Harrison Ford maybe turn into the Red Hulk.</p>
