			<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements were <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1849828271372026120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the type of system configuration required to play the game at different resolutions, 30 and 60 frames per second, and with different graphics presets.</p>
<p>To run the game at 720p resolution at 30 frames per second at the Very Low preset, players require an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 1300x CPU, GTX 1650 4 GB or AMD Radeaon RX 5500 XT4 4GB an 16 GB of RAM. On the other hand, to enjoy the game at its best at the Very High preset, 4K resolution, and 60 frames per second, players will need an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU, RTX 4080 or Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-Remastered-PC-system-requirements-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Judging from the infographic above, the Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements are essentially the same as those of Forbidden West, so those who had no trouble running the second entry in the series released earlier this year on PC shouldn't have much trouble running the remaster of the first, which comes with some impressive enhancements as detailed <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches on October 31st on PC and PlayStation 5. The remaster will be available for only $10 to owners of the original release.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[River of Gold Review - Gold for Gameplay, Bronze for Theme]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/river-of-gold-review-gold-for-gameplay-bronze-for-theme.1019478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running centrally through almost the entirety of Rokugan, the <em>River of Gold</em> connects all but the Northernmost clans with the central trade. Influence there means power across the continent. Welcome to <em>River of Gold</em>, a board game set in the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting. I was just sent a review copy of <em>River of Gold</em>, so let's&nbsp;have a look at the core board game, and see how deep the theme runs throughout.</p>

<p>I've been playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit"><em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> (<em>L5R</em>)</a> since the first edition roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty">collectible card game (CCG)</a> when it was first published in 1995, and I've played all editions through its life, to the last living card game incarnation of the card game, and the current edition of the roleplaying game by Edge Studios.</p>

<p>When I heard they were making a board game set focused on merchants, over the standard samurai, courtiers, and shugenja (magic users in the world of Rokugan), my only hope was that they still kept the wonderful and incredibly detailed theme of the setting. With nearly 30 years worth of lore, this could be an incredible way to introduce a whole new market of gamers to this rich world of <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=pd5GUvsN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=6dOmBMQE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>River of Gold</em> components look incredible laid out on the tabletop [Photo: Office Dog Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>The aim of <em>River of Gold</em> is to score victory points, and these can be achieved by delivering orders or trade goods, gaining influence along the river by building buildings, and claiming masteries, which are competitive goals.</p>

<p>The turn phase for each player is simple, streamlined, and adds a real pace to the game. Players roll a dice at the end of their turn, which gives them time to plan their next turn while other players are taking theirs. At the start of their turn, they can use divine favor points to modify their dice, and then they get a choice of 3 actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=tBIIINBC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=0a9u95Iz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get a choice of buildings to place in <em>River of Gold</em>, and these also determine the pace of the game, moving the game into the next era when enough have been built.</figcaption></figure><p>Players can either build a building along the river, which gives some immediate rewards, and also rewards you when other players visit your shore space. Buildings also gain you influence in the area, moving you along an influence track, which gains you further rewards and victory points during the end game.</p>

<p>Or players can also choose to sail one of their ships along the river (players get 2 ships, which start the game at different points on the river) which gains you visitor rewards for the areas you visit, and also owner rewards for those who own buildings in those areas. The final action choice is to deliver to a customer.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, players draw 2 customer cards that detail the customer's request. By fulfilling the customer's request, players gain an ongoing ability, and also an end-game effect to help with scoring.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=7r0FG6jc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=KODPWJH4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> includes custom dice with a number and a symbol that tie into each available action.</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the above action choices is influenced by the dice roll, which all have matching numbers and symbols. Players can move spaces equal to the dice, build in one of the 6 shore areas that match their dice, or deliver to a customer who also has a matching die number at the top of their card (there are 5 customer types, each with 6 cards to match each dice number/symbol). So there is some element of randomness, but as mentioned above, you can change your dice roll with your limited divine favor points.</p>

<p>The pace of the game is kept going by the 2 eras that are controlled by the building track. Once enough buildings have been built, 2nd-era building tiles start to appear, triggering the start of the 2nd-era, with the final phase for each player starting when the last 2nd-era building tile hits the board. The simplicity of the turn keeps games moving, even with 4 players, and there's a lot to think about when choosing your actions.</p>

<p>You want buildings so that you're getting visit rewards as players sail, but you also want to deliver to customers to get the ongoing benefits from that, and you also want to sail yourself in order to get money to build buildings, but you also want to stop your opponent's from getting the things that they want in certain areas.</p>

<p>It all comes together for a very light, but strategic non-confrontational game, very much like the courts of Rokugan, where you can never outright challenge, but you can make passive-aggressive remarks, and make moves to stop your opponents, rather than aggressively attacking them.</p>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has 4 clans that you can play, the Crab, Crane, Mantis, and Scorpion. But your clan choice has no in-game effect other than changing the color of your pieces, and the flavor text on the reverse of your player board (which you never see because you use the other side of it in the game.</p>

<p>There is an included Clan Patrons expansion to the game, where you can pick or randomly determine which of the 2 patrons you use for each clan (each clan has 2 unique patrons), and this gives you a benefit throughout the game. This adds an element of theme that ties into the clans themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=ITRGBQ40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=1E6PHGkn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> has an included mini-expansion, Clan Patrons, that adds some <em>L5R</em> theme to the game.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Deep Is the <em>Legend Of The Five Rings</em> Theme In <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has got some beautiful components, and it looks very <em>L5R</em>. There's a great map in the back of the rulebook that will help new players immerse themselves in the Rokugan setting, and there's incredible artwork used throughout. But other than the Clan Patrons mini-expansion, the theme is skin only, and this could be any setting and wouldn't change the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>L5R</em> clans are all vastly different, with their own unique flavor, strengths, and weaknesses, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have capitalized on this. No one trusts the Scorpions, the Mantis are considered lower than the other clans, because while a major clan, they are made up of several smaller clans, and the Crane and Crab hate each other. The Crab are very warlike, defending the continent against the horrors that live in the Shadowlands, and because of this, they favor anything that lets them win, over what the other clans would consider honorable. But none of this comes through in <em>River of Gold</em>.</p>

<p>The mini-expansion goes some way, but for the effort it took to include cards, they could have easily just included some optional rules for each clan on their clan board. Given each clan an ability, a restriction, or a goal that they have to achieve to gain extra rewards, or penalties for not achieving at the end.</p>

<p>This would have kept the balance of the core game, but given <em>L5R</em> fans and those new to the setting, a deeper feel for the theme, and not have made it feel so soulless when such a deep setting has been used to promote the mechanics.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><i>River of Gold </i>is a great game. It looks beautiful, play is fluid, fun, and challenging, but it feels like a copout to use such a deep setting, and then not include anything beyond a couple of cards on the theme. Hopefully, new players will be drawn in to explore more of the setting because <em>L5R</em> is incredible, but for an <em>L5R</em> fan, this feels like a missed opportunity to make an incredible <em>L5R</em> board game, about an element not usually covered in the roleplaying or card games.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>If you want a solid board game that's easy to play, doesn't have direct confrontation, and also looks beautiful on your tabletop, then <em>River of Gold</em> will hit the spot. If you're looking for a board game that looks into the rich theme and narrative of the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting, then beyond the Clan Patrons mini-expansion (which does add a little depth to each clan), you won't find much here beyond the <em>L5R</em> art and capturing of the setting in the components.</p>

                <p>In 1997, one of the most-remembered moments from Final Fantasy 7 was the murder of a beloved companion character, which resonated throughout the rest of the game and all of its subsequent follow-up media. Final Fantasy 7's narrative hinges on that moment, and there didn't seem to be any way around it without cheats until now.</p><p><strong>Spoiler warning: If you don't know who dies in this 27-year-old game or don't want to know, stop reading now.</strong></p><p>Aerith Gainsborough meets her end at the hands of Sephiroth, but as related by a Final Fantasy 7 speedrunner who goes by Luzbel, a way to skip past Aerith's death was found by two other players: AceZephyr and Kuma.</p><p>The way to pull it off is more of a glitch than a cheat. When the player is riding a chocobo on the world map, there's nothing that prevents them from walking to the Forgotten Capital, the site of Aeirth's murder. If Aeirth is in the player's party, she'll see her own death and fight alongside the player against Jenova. The downside to this approach is that players won't have a high level during the fight, and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-discovered-final-fantasy-7-glitch-finally-lets-you-save-beloved-character" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the game will "softlock" during cutscenes if Aerith is in the party after the timeframe of her death.</p><p>Aerith's fate was also one of the primary plot points in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> earlier this year, which demonstrates her enduring popularity among fans of the new series. The newly discovered glitch in the original game may spare Aeirth from death, but it's not a perfect solution, and she wasn't really meant to survive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/castle-crashers-dev-behemoth-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>developer The Behemoth has announced its next project, and it's an arcade throwback title with a very familiar name.</p>

<p>"Game 6", as The Behemoth refers to it, will also be called&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, and it'll launch on PC via Steam on October 31st. It'll enjoy some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also set to launch on that date</a>.</p>

<p>The Steam page for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>describes the game as an "arcade extravaganza" in which you play as a chicken gathering up baby chicks and collecting candy corn as you soar through the skies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=UcrkFUQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=BsjFKs1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Behemoth's new game&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically weird.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay footage released by The Behemoth today makes&nbsp;its latest game<em>&nbsp;</em>look a little like&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, although mercifully, it appears not to be embracing the kind of live-service nonsense the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>reboot</a> is going for.</p>

<p>Candy corn you collect over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will allow you to unlock cosmetics "like chicken colors, beaks, wattles, and feet", and you'll also be able to compete in daily leaderboards to see if you can beat the rest of the world at&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>.</p>

<p>The game is aiming for a pretty low price point, too; it'll only cost you $3.99, which puts it on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;(although it's unlikely we'll be seeing any<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc"><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC</a>&nbsp;for this one anytime soon).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, which also shows off the kind of chaotic gameplay you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will be The Behemoth's sixth major project. The studio's first effort was the Flash game&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid</em>, which was followed up by side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>in 2008.</p>

<p>After that, the California-based studio released wacky platformer&nbsp;<em>Battleblock Theater&nbsp;</em>in 2013 and strategy RPG&nbsp;<em>Pit People&nbsp;</em>in 2018, followed by a reimagined version of debut title <em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3027260/BEHEMOTH/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a> on October 31st. Stay tuned for more on all other things The Behemoth-related.</p>

            <p>Rock Paper Shotgun has a fuzzy conception of "news", in that we regard the "new" element of news as sorely overrated, more of a guideline than an obligation. The trick to selling this mindset gracefully is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. "It's news to me," I sternly insist, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lethal-company-developers-next-game-is-an-open-world-where-you-cant-see">announcing a game</a> you might pedantically observe was actually announced in 2019. "I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it," I declare, writing about my discovery that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> requires a permanent internet connection, even when you're playing the campaign.</p>
<p>The hair-splitters amongst you might object that this has been known since June this year, but that's no problem, because I have no reliable empirical evidence that you exist either. The only sources I'm prepared to trust are certain people on Reddit, who have also just learned about the always-online requirement after experiencing disconnects in single player, and are getting violently pissed off.</p>
<p>The implications of Call Of Duty single player going always-online are as you'd expect. Firstly, there's the risk of being  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1gblua0/due_to_call_of_duty_black_ops_6s_always_online/">booted out of your campaign playthrough</a> if you experience a disconnection, and secondly, the story mode will only be playable while Activision keeps the servers online. I'm not expecting them to pull support anytime soon - this is Call Of Duty, the annual shootman extravaganza which new owner Microsoft is prepared to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">sacrifice hundreds of developer livelihoods for</a>, though not their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">CEO's annual compensation</a>. Still, there will come a point when they wind down the servers, and we can only hope they've added an offline mode by then.</p>
<p>While digital rights management could be a factor, Black Ops 6 seems to require an internet connection because it makes heavy use of texture-streaming, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">a bid to cut down install sizes</a>. As remembered by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/infuriating-black-ops-6-campaign-crashes-caused-by-awful-online-only-requirements/">Videogamer</a>, the ability to stream textures to your hard drive was added in November 2020, following the release of Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. It was optional then. It's mandatory now, though there's a "Minimal" option for people with less bandwidth.</p><p>Our Black Ops 6 review is in progress. I've just obtained a code, and might give the campaign a try myself over the weekend. I'll let you know how the always-online stuff pans out, either in a Maw post or in a separate article. It'll still be news by then, for all of reality is but the fleeting reflection of my mind's eye. If you're more interested in the multiplayer, Jeremy has conjured up some guides for the best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-loadouts">Black Ops 6 loadouts</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">best Black Ops 6 guns</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</h5><p><span>October 31st</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Grasshopper Manufacture</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The story of Shadows of the Damned's development is an interesting one. The second-ever collaboration between <a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51-and-shinji-mikami-interview-discussing-shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-killer-7-sequel-and-more/">Goichi "Suda51" Suda</a>, creator of the No More Heroes series, and Shinji Mikami, the man behind Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, and many other successful CAPCOM games, the game was originally conceptualized to be a survival horror game called Kurayami very different from the wacky, edgy, over-the-top third-person shooter that eventually released in 2013. Despite Suda51 not being too pleased by the many changes made to his original concept, Shadows of the Damned turned out to be an extremely fun game with some standout features, such as the story and characters, the dark humor, and the relentless pacing that makes the entire experience feel like a true rollercoaster from beginning to end. The soundtrack by Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka was the cherry on top of an extremely tasty cake.</p>
<p>After being stuck in PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hell and being unplayable on more modern gaming hardware, the cult classic by Grasshopper Manufacture has been given a second chance with Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, a remaster that leaves the original experience almost untouched while slightly updating visuals and adding a small selection of additional content.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241016134149_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If we were to just evaluate the remastering job, there's no doubt that Grasshopper Manufacture and Engine Software really did the bare minimum. On PC, and presumably PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, the visuals now render at 4K resolution, but most of the assets don't seem to have been updated in any way, resulting in uneven visual quality. And that's it, basically. The PC port supports rebindable mouse and keyboard controls, which work great for a third-person shooter in the vein of Shadows of the Damned, but that is the only setting that can be changed in this version of the game, as there are no graphics options whatsoever. It's not even possible to change resolution: the game just runs in fullscreen mode using the monitor's resolution. While this could be fine, given the type of game and how undemanding it is, it's really difficult to accept a PC port with no options to tweak whatsoever in 2024. At the very least, the remaster is priced reasonably at $24,99 and, ultimately, does what it set out to do: give players the chance to experience the madness Suda51 and Mikami created over ten years ago on modern gaming hardware.</p>
<p>Even though Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered leaves a lot to be desired as a remaster, it is still a worthwhile release as the game is still as fun as it was in 2013. Controlling demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, players travel to the Underworld to save his girlfriend Paula from the Lord of Demons, Fleming, who wants to get back at the demon hunter by repeatedly killing the woman in the most gruesome of fashions. Aiding the foul-mouthed demon hunter is the equally foul-mouthed demon Johnson, who can transform into a bike, a torch, and multiple weapons with some ludicrous names, such as Hot Boner, and even more ludicrous capabilities, such as using demon teeth as ammo. With the demon acting as a guide, Garcia makes his way to Fleming's Castle of Hassle, fighting hordes of demons, opening up doors using the weirdest of keys, including the strawberries that demons love so much, and learning how unhinged the Underworld and its denizens truly are.</p>
<p>From this quick overview, it should be clear how the Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered characters and setting are standouts in the experience. While Garcia's journey is relatively straightforward, the eight or so hours required to complete the game are quite memorable thanks to its dark humor and the banter between Garcia and Johnson, which is so entertaining that by itself, it could be worth the price of admission alone. In many ways, the Shadows of the Damned experience is reminiscent of Madworld from PlatinumGames, where straightforward gameplay was elevated by irreverent humor and wacky setting. Outstanding performances from Steve Blum as Garcia and Greg Ellis as Johnson further enhance the experience, delivering all the game’s hilarious dialogue and stories with convincing charm.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241018134823_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the story and characters have aged extremely well, also considering how we don't see this type of humor too often nowadays, the gameplay hasn't aged as well, although it is still quite fun. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered hasn't touched the original mechanics and features in any way, so the game still plays like a straightforward, high-speed third-person shooter sharing some remote similarities with Resident Evil 4, mostly due to Mikami-san's involvement. The game, however, couldn't be any different from the glorious entry in the CAPCOM series in regards to the complexity of the level design. In Shadows of the Damned, the locations aren't particularly big or articulate, and the vast majority of puzzles players find are closed doors that require some of the aforementioned keys to open, which are often obtained by exploring the immediate vicinities of the closed doors or by killing demons. The entire experience is undoubtedly built around combat, and it is geared toward moving players from one intense combat encounter to the next, which could be disappointing for those looking for a more involving experience, but it's this no-nonsense, breakneck pace that makes Shadows of the Damned the engaging game it still is in 2024.</p>
<p>The quality of the combat mechanics and the scenarios created around them also help quite a lot. The basics are incredibly simple. Garcia's arsenal includes three long-range weapons - a handgun, a shotgun, and a sub-machine gun - a torch that can be used as a short-range weapon, and a Light Shot, which is used to dispel barriers made of darkness, stun enemies temporarily, light up certain locations and more. Stunned enemies can also be killed with a gloriously gory special attack that is extremely effective, sometimes maybe a little too much. Outside of upgrades to weapons, which unlock new combat options, Garcia's moveset doesn't change during the course of the game, but the combat scenarios and the enemies do, and quite a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241016134345_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the journey, for example, the player is told that staying in the darkness is extremely bad and that Garcia can only resist inside for a set amount of time before his health starts dropping. However, as the adventure proceeds, darkness becomes an invaluable ally to the demon hunter, as standing in it will allow him to shoot switches to unlock doors, uncover weak points of specific demons, and even take down some of them without having to get into an intense fight. The way the game twists its simple mechanics to provide variety is remarkable, and very few games managed to achieve this so competently. With the addition of some simple mini-games, genre-bending sequences like the classic sidescrolling shoot'em up sequences in Chapter 4, and some amazing boss battles, with the exception of a couple of endgame fights, the experience never gets stale for its entire duration. The lack of any side venture or collectibles, ultimately, damages the experience's replay value a bit, but also makes it so that it can keep this engaging pace without faltering. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered adds a much-requested New Game Plus mode, which is a great way to experience Garcia's journey again without having to worry about upgrades. A couple of new costumes round up the additions included in the remaster, which are not game-changing in any capacity but are still nice to have.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is not in any way close to the best remasters released in recent years, featuring a middling visual upgrade and an extremely limited amount of new content. As a way to give Suda51 and Mikami's collaboration a second chance, however, it definitely delivers. Over a decade after its release, the Shadows of the Damned experience continues to be one of a kind and one that's worth experiencing for all fans of the two legendary Japanese developers.</p>

<p>As a remaster, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered leaves something to be desired, offering minimal visual improvements, no graphics options on PC, and no gameplay enhancements. However, it's still a worthwhile purchase for fans of Suda51, Shinji Mikami, and third-person shooters., as the quality of the original experience still shines through, with its relentless pace, engaging story, memorable characters, and a dark humor that's hard to find in games today. Garcia Hotspur's war against Fleming to save Paula remains just as captivating now as it was in 2013.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's bringing crossover card skins based on popular franchises like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and more.</p>

<p>This update constitutes the second part of the "Friends of Jimbo" event, which was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>&nbsp;and which has already seen the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>joining&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(with the latter even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro">returning the favor recently</a>).</p>

<p>The latest Friends of Jimbo update brings four new franchises into the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>fold:&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, each of which gets a number of cards based on "fan-favorite characters".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=49QhJLB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=LrJL_O6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has some new crossover cards for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the first Friends of Jimbo update, this&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>crossover content is entirely free, and it's up for grabs across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is currently available as well, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date">mobile devices</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this isn't the big&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update that developer LocalThunk <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">promised back in August</a>. That one is set to bring "new ideas and strategies" to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and it's set to launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to avoid the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>hype, it's a poker-based roguelike created by Canadian developer LocalThunk, and it's based around creating big combos and game-breaking strategies to reach higher and higher score multipliers.</p>

<p>While the game is based on poker, it's more about creating synergy across the cards in your deck so that you can keep meeting a series of rising point antes over the course of a run.</p>




<p>Shortly after being released,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed 500,000 sales</a>, hitting the million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">within a month of its initial launch</a>. At last count, the game had reached two million sales, and that number is only likely to increase as time goes on.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/balatro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

<p>For those interested in taking advantage of the gun, here are the best Model L attachments, Perks, and Equipment to use.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-model-l-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Model L attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Model L</a> excels in medium-ranged engagements, with a slow fire rate that’s easy to control and consistent damage. The iron sights aren’t the best, so the <strong>Merlin Mini </strong>is a nice choice for Optic. Then, to keep you off the enemy’s radar, the <strong>Suppressor</strong> Muzzle is a vital option. </p>



<p>Boosting the damage range and bullet velocity is the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong>, making the weapon even more effective at range. Then, the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> gives you more than enough bullets in a mag to finish off multiple enemies. Lastly, the <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves handling with a decrease in aim down sight and sprint-to-fire speeds.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-model-l">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Model L</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>Perks are a vital aspect of any loadout in BO6, and so we’ve chosen <strong>Assassin</strong>, <strong>Double Time</strong>, and <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> to get the Enforcer Combat Speciality. Then, <strong>Perk Greed</strong> allows you to select another Perk, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket </strong>to be a huge lifesaver, especially when enemies are lobbing grenades at the objective.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are a classic tool for catching enemies in enclosed spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up with health. Finally, we’ve gone with the <strong>Trophy System</strong> to support the team in capturing objectives.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-model-l">Best Secondary for Model L</h2>



<p>The best Secondary weapon for the Model L is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>, a fully automatic pistol that can support your battles in close-range situations. As the Model L is a long-range AR, this Secondary keeps you covered in those close-combat situations where you need something that has a faster fire rate and more mobility.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-model-l-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Model L in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will unlock the Model L in Black Ops 6 by reaching Level 40. This will take some time, but by playing objective-based modes and gaining as much XP as possible, you should get there in a relatively fast fashion.</p>



<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to rank up fast</a> if you’re eager for tips on unlocking the gun quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-model-l-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Model L any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Model L is great on medium and large-sized maps, but it isn’t he best at close ranges due to its slow fire rate. So, with that said, it’s an excellent AR but you’ll need to play to its strengths to get the most out of it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When Season 14 arrives in December for Overwatch 2, Blizzard will bring back 6v6 matches with two different tests. The original game featured those team sizes, but the sequel controversially replaced that setup with 5v5 competitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller detailed the upcoming 6v6 experiments on <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's website</a>. The first test should land during the first week of Season 14 (currently scheduled to launch December 10) and will incorporate team compositions of "at least 1 of each role, and no more than 3." Then, in the middle of Season 14, Overwatch 2 will try out "the classic 2-2-2 composition" with a few changes.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1598264205" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

different ways that we might implement a change without running into the same problems we had previously." There seems to be a lot up for consideration for Overwatch 2 in regard to 6v6. For instance, Keller stated that previously he couldn't foresee 5v5 and 6v6 both working together in the sequel. But now, he's open to the idea.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-6v6-sort-of/1100-6525278/" data-ref-id="1100-6525278">Bringing back 6v6 for Overwatch 2</a> was initially broached in July.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> may have just turned a decade old, but it's seemingly more popular than ever, setting a new highest daily active user count of over 500,000 players.</p>
<p>DayZ's second expansion, Frostline, has tempted - and tempted back - hundreds of thousands of players, with 501,222 logging on on 20th October: 235,618 on Steam, 113,897 on PlayStation, and 152,037 on Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-400k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>has reached a pretty impressive sales milestone despite being on release for less than a week, developer Wube Software has revealed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Friday Facts</a>&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>blog post, Wube says that&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>sales have passed the 400,000 mark. Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>enjoyed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-player-count-space-age-20-update">highest ever concurrent player count</a>&nbsp;thanks to the launch of said DLC, as well as the base game's 2.0 update.</p>

<p>By way of one "last little surprise" for&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, Wube also announced a new feature called the Galaxy of Fame. Essentially, when you finish&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s campaign, you'll be able to upload a snapshot of your game, which will then add your game's info and stats to a collective gallery.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-galaxy-of-fame.jpg?itok=i9XKn2Cu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-galaxy-of-fame.jpg?itok=M6KBCYkA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Galaxy of Fame allows&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>players to immortalize their achievements.</figcaption></figure><p>While you're looking at the Galaxy of Fame, you can browse other player' factories and get a glimpse into their inner workings. Wube says it isn't banning "saves that use cheats/commands/editor" yet, although more "filtering options" will soon be added.</p>

<p>The studio also provides an update on&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>and the 2.0 update for Nintendo Switch. Sadly, if you were hoping for the DLC to hit Nintendo's console, there's some bad news: the Switch isn't getting&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>.</p>

<p>Wube says that there's "simply not enough RAM" in the Switch to fit&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s new factories, nor is there enough CPU to run the DLC at 60fps thanks to the expanded systems. New sprites also won't fit in the Switch's VRAM, apparently.</p>

<p>However, the 2.0 update will be making its way to the Switch. Wube says it should arrive in "1-2 months", although the studio is reluctant to commit to a release date "since the release process on consoles takes a long time".</p>




<p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and the base game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also available on Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/factorio-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

If you look at titles such as <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, they clearly know how to modernize famous franchises for today’s audiences, while remaining mainly faithful to the source material.

Most point toward the quality-of-life features like the ability to skip time between cases, and the overall polish of the remaster. It’s a stable, smooth game that’s downright fun to play.</p><p>However, even the most user-friendly gaming experience will attract negative reviews. <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> isn’t perfect, and the bad reviews point out its flaws in spades.

<p>Those looking to for a reason as to why Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold below expectations thus leading to a sequel being rejected need to look to the top of Ubisoft. </p>



<p>That’s what Michael Douse, the director of publishing at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios, had to say about the situation. </p>



<p>In a social media post (h/t <a href="https://80.lv/articles/baldur-s-gate-3-publishing-director-blames-ubisoft-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-s-poor-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>), Douse pointed the fingers at Ubisoft management, saying that the decision to not release the game on Steam day one hurt any chance of the game’s success.</p>



<p>“The last notable game on their platform was arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021,” <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1849147473354211400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Douse said</a>. “The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn’t perform, so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn’t be launching their store all too much.</p>



<p>“If it had released on Steam not only would it have been a market success, but there would likely be a sequel because the team are so strong.”</p>



<p>He then went on to call out the game’s critical success across the board.</p>



<p>“It’s such a broken strategy,” he said. “The hardest thing is to make a 85+ game — it is much, much easier to release one. It just shouldn’t be done as it was.</p>

<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has sold around one million copies since its launch, far below what the internal expectations were for the game. Insider Gaming learned that Ubisoft was was expecting the game to sell on par, or better, than some of biggest Metroidvania’s in the market. When that didn’t happen right away, a decision was made to move on from the project.</p>



<p>Now, the team that developed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is no more after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft disbanded them to move on</a> to different games.</p>
