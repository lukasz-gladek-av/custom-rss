<p>Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t helped it grow Xbox Game Pass or the gaming business in general. According to a new report from The Information, the growth from the acquisition has yet to hit what Microsoft was hoping for when it made the $69 billion purchase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Information claims</a> that Microsoft was hoping that the purchase would help convince more players to sign up to the service as well as push more studios to releasing their games on the subscription-based platform. Instead, their sources say say that “several leading game studios have resisted Microsoft’s pitch that they should put their titles on Game Pass in exchange for fees that Microsoft offers to pay to the gaming studios.”</p>



<p>Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who oversees funds including a reported $800 million of Microsoft stock, told the outlet, “[Activision] has been disappointing.”</p>



<p>Microsoft had targeted reaching 100 million subscribers by 2030. As of February 2024, there were 34 million subscribers, including those who became subscribers after Microsoft converted Xbox Live to Xbox Game Pass Core. Microsoft has failed to hit Game Pass growth targets in each of the last two years. That led to Game Pass’s growth being dropped as a metric that determined CEO Satya Nadella’s pay at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its prices</a> while introducing a new tier—Game Pass Standard—that took away Day One releases from console subscribers unless they upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft expected more studios and publishers to rent Azure cloud servers for their games. It’s said that Activision is still using Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its server rentals along with “primarily relying on its own servers for development”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft regarding the report. Should a response of any kind be received, it will be added to this story. Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision not helping Microsoft grow its Xbox Game Pass service along with other areas of the gaming division?

                <p>It's officially 115 Day for Zombies fans, with January 15 being the yearly celebration of Call of Duty's Zombies mode. For this year's festivities, Treyarch has revealed the details for the next Zombies map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>, and double XP is now live to celebrate 115 Day.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's new Zombies map is called The Tomb, which will launch with the start of Season 2 on January 28. This map's narrative follows the events of the Citadelle des Morts main quest, with the characters headed to an excavation site in search of the Sentinel Artifact. A first look at the map can be seen in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245" data-ratio="0.5375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245"></a><figcaption>The Tomb DLC map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says The Tomb was designed to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. The developer also teases one of the season's new weapons by saying, "What if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?" This could be hinting at the return of the MP-40 or PPSh-41 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate 115 Day, a quad feed of double XP is available in Black Ops 6 from now until January 21. This includes the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2X GobbleGum earn rate</li><li dir="ltr">2X Player XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Weapon XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Battle Pass XP</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch included a preview of the quality-of-life upgrades planned for the Season 2 update. This includes a challenge-tracking feature similar to the one available in Modern Warfare 3, letting players track up to 10 challenges for camos and calling cards.</p><p dir="ltr">A new co-op pause feature is being added with Season 2. Currently, the pause feature is only available in solo games, but the update will include the option to pause when playing with friends. This feature requires all players to be in the same party, and the party leader will have the ability to pause the match for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have the ability to choose a separate HUD preset for Zombies and multiplayer, so they no longer need to switch HUDs between modes.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on The Tomb will arrive closer to the season's launch, but here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything we know so far about Season 2</a>, including the much-anticipated updates for the Ricochet anti-cheat.</p>

            <p>
Stray Kite Studios, the indie developer co-founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> lead designer Paul Hellquist, has unveiled its first original title - fantasy themed real-time tactics roguelite Wartorn, which is coming to PC early access at some point this "spring".
</p>
<p>
Stray Kite - whose other co-founder is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/age-of-empires-online">Age of Empires Online</a> lead programmer Shovaen Patel - has previously collaborated on likes of Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, but Wartorn will be its first original release. It follows two elven sisters, Yara and Elani, as they journey across the war-ravaged Isles of Talaur - a fantasy realm "torn apart by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds" - in order to reach the safety of their ancestral home.
</p>
<p>
Wartorn is described as a "single-player, squad-based, roguelite campaign experience" that'll see players recruiting groups of strategically diverse fantasy creatures - including goblins, elves, demons, treefolk, and more - to their Caravan. Squads can be mixed and matched before skirmishes, with battlefield positioning, squad combos, and careful deployment of abilities all said to be key. Losses, however, will reduce morale, and it's Game Over if all hope is lost.

<p>
Additionally, there's talk of emergent, elemental-themed combat, enabling players to harness the likes of fire, water, lightning, tar, and planta to create unique tactical opportunities - with tar amplifying fire, lightning surging through water, and so on. That's on top of a physics-based environmental destruction system, intended to add "depth and unpredictability" to battles - and there's also a slow-down-time feature, giving players pause to issue precise commands in order to make "even the most complex scenarios... accessible".
</p><p>
Stray Kite is also touting a heavy focus on narrative, with players facing "unpredictable" events with each new attempt to get home. These are said to involve tough, impactful decisions - from who gets fed to which lives can be saved - plus "moral quandaries of violence and sacrifice".
</p>
<p>
"Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness," Hellquist (who also served as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> creative director) explains in today's announcement. "We've poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us."
</p>
<p>
Wartorn is currently scheduled to enter early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store sometime this "spring". Stray Kite is promising a "polished experience and a wide range of units, squad upgrades, hero upgrades, family members, biomes, maps, events, and quests" at launch, with more coming as development progresses toward Wartorn's 1.0 release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/former-blizzard-ccos-bonfire-studios-game-is-called-arkheron/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The next game led by former Blizzard Chief Creative Officer (CCO) Rob Pardo has officially been revealed. Pardo’s Bonfire Studios has announced Arkheron, a team-based PvP game “set in a dark and foreboding world”.</p>



<p>According to the studio, Arkheron will feature familiar “ideas and concepts”, but the game is “about creating something entirely new”. That being a dynamic, fast-paced PvP gameplay experience.</p>



<p>“There’s a simple truth at the heart of our development philosophy,” Pardo said via release. “If we don’t love our game, our players won’t either. We believe the best games are born from a genuine love of playing them, which is why we’ve poured years of passion into developing&nbsp;Arkheron, constantly iterating and refining it to deliver something truly unique and exciting. </p>



<p>“We’ve played the game daily as a team for years, and while we haven’t figured out yet exactly how to describe it, we often say ‘you have to play it to get it’. We’re eager to start sharing the fun we’ve found in&nbsp;Arkheron&nbsp;with a wider community soon, and we hope players will love it as much as we do.”</p>



<p>The game has been holding private playtests and will be opening it up to more players in the coming months. Signups <a href="https://bonfirestudios.com/playtest/index.html?rafid=FYK-22192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are currently open</a> for those in North America with more regions opening later this year.</p>



<p>What are you hoping Bonfire Studios’ Arkheron entails, and are you going to sign up for the playtest? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/15/xbox-repair-reduce-waste-energy-saving/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> new options for support to repair your Xbox console. The first, for in-person repairs, will begin on January 20 with uBreakiFix by Asurion becoming an Xbox Authorized Service Provider at nearly 700 store locations across the US The second involves the Microsoft Store, with replacement components becoming available to purchase online as of today.</p><p>According to the blog post, these options include the Xbox Series S - 1TB in Robot White, Xbox Series X - 1TB Digital Edition in Robot White, and Xbox Series X - 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition. Microsoft advises reaching out to your nearest <a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uBreakiFix</a> by Asurion location and confirming participation in the program.</p><p>If you prefer to order parts online, the components are available via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's online store</a>, as well as the Microsoft Repair Hub on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iFixit</a>. Previously, the replacement components available for purchase were limited to controller parts.</p><p>In the blog post, Microsoft also details a correlation between these new repair options and the company's goal to become a "zero waste, carbon-negative, and water-positive company by 2030." In the meantime, it's aiming to eliminate single-use plastics from its packaging by 2025--hence why the Xbox Series X|S packaging is paper- and fiber-based.</p><p>Said goal has also had a smaller impact on the consoles themselves. According to Microsoft, it has improved how the Xbox Series S handles video, with average reduction approaching 10% in power consumption. The company also recommends using the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which can be found via Settings, General, and Power Options on your console.</p><p>The shutdown option has been available since September of last year, its addition paired alongside the announcement that the company's green initiatives have saved over 3 billion car miles of CO2 emissions.

"We fundamentally believe that the answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly," Microsoft president Brad Smith told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-15/microsoft-s-ai-investment-imperils-climate-goal-as-emissions-jump-30?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.

<p>Nikola “NiKo” Kovač has finally played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his first official match with Team Falcons</a>, and the organization has to be pleased with the first result of this new CS2 lineup. Despite substantial financial backing, Falcons has struggled to break into the top of the Counter-Strike hierarchy in recent years, but the result today is a step in the right direction.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-niko-and-former-heroic-trio-shine-against-ence-at-blast-bounty">NiKo and Former Heroic Trio Shine against ENCE at BLAST Bounty</h2>



<p>Utilizing the <a href="https://blast.tv/article/blast-premier-2025-bounty-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST event’s bounty system</a>, the lower-seeded ENCE opted to challenge Falcons. The ENCE core, led by four-time Major winner Lukas “gla1ve” Rossander, sought to take advantage of Falcons’ short time spent practising together. ENCE gambled on a Train pick, hoping that Falcons would be even less prepared on the newest CS2 map.</p>



<p>Train was a highly entertaining affair, as the unfamiliar map produced a messy but fun match of Counter-Strike. But the big match experience of NiKo and the entirety of the Falcons roster prevailed over ENCE. ENCE came up short in several rounds where they had a man advantage and were unable to hold onto a late 12-9 lead. It wasn’t NiKo who led the way for Falcons, but former Heroic member René “TeSeS” Madsen, who produced four multi-kill rounds in the final six rounds of regulation and overtime. Falcons claimed four straight rounds in OT to steal away Train, 16-12.</p>







<p>The series turned to Dust2, a strong map historically for several of Falcons’ players. Falcons started strong with five straight T-side rounds, though ENCE managed to fight their way back. NiKo stepped up the most in Falcons’ second half CT-side, but the team couldn’t stop ENCE from sending the second map to OT as well. However, TeSeS delivered for Falcons in the clutch again in OT, closing out a close series win for Falcons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-removal-of-a-private-doctor-sparked-a-union-at-the-developer-of-candy-crush<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In early 2024, Activision Blizzard under its new owner Microsoft sent an email around to employees at its Stockholm office letting them know that one of their most popular company benefits was going away. And in doing so, the company inadvertently sparked a union effort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has learned that last fall, over one hundred employees at mobile game maker King’s Stockholm location formed a union club with Unionen, Sweden’s largest trade union. The group has since been acknowledged and is in communication with company management in the hopes of eventually securing a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that will govern their work environment, policies, and benefits going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unions in Sweden are a bit different from the ones those in the U.S. may be familiar with. In Sweden, eligible workers can join a trade union representing the type of work they do at any time, regardless of whether or not their individual company has organized. As a result, roughly 70% of the country is involved in a trade union (per data shared by Unionen), and the country has a long history of laws more friendly to unions than in many other countries. Trade unions negotiate broadly with their respective sectors over working conditions such as salaries and sick leave, and individual membership in a trade union can confer some small, extra benefits to employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s another layer to union membership in Sweden, which is forming a union club and securing a CBA. If enough employees join the same union at a company, they can vote to install a union board to negotiate a CBA on their behalf. That CBA can secure them additional workplace-specific benefits similar to U.S. union contracts, and local union boards can even receive representation at the top levels of company management and a voice in major company decisions. This is what has happened at King Stockholm, following a growing games industry trend already seen at Swedish gaming companies such as <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-sign-collective-bargaining-agreement-with-labor-unions" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Paradox Interactive</u></a> and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-100-developers-of-just-cause-contraband-at-avalanche-studios-have-unionized"><u>more recently, Avalanche Studios</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The doctor is out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke with Kajsa Sima Falck, an engineering manager at King in Stockholm and a board member of King Stockholm’s Unionen chapter. Falck explained to me that prior to 2024, union talk at the company was relatively quiet. There was a channel in the company Slack dedicated to union discussion for the small handful of union members, but it mostly went unused. She recalls it having only around nine or ten members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then, in early January, employees of Activision Blizzard in Stockholm received an email from management with some devastating news. Falck explains that during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Stockholm office had been granted an unusual benefit: a free, private doctor for themselves and their families. The doctor, rumored to have been hand-picked by then-CEO Bobby Kotick, quickly became extremely popular among the staff. She was good at her job, Falck said, quick to respond to phone calls and emails, instrumental in supporting them during the pandemic, and empathetic toward employees’ requests for sick leave or mental health notes. Over time, much of the staff came to rely on her for all their healthcare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is why it was so devastating when employees were told, not long after Activision Blizzard was acquired by Microsoft, that this benefit was being taken away. What’s more, employees were only given a week’s notice as to the end of this benefit, meaning individuals and families suddenly had to scramble to find a new doctor and new healthcare options.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/welcome-to-our-new-stockholm-kingdom-1-1736961303607.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">King's office in Stockholm, Sweden.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Employees were offered private health insurance benefits effectively to replace the doctor, but Falck noted that the replacement benefits aren't as good as what they had before. “You have to go through a portal and you have to talk to a nurse every time you want to get an appointment for something,” she says. “So it's not that personal experience of having a doctor, like a proper person that cares for you, and wants the best for you, and puts you on sick leave if you're feeling burnt out. She [the private doctor] was a godsend.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Falck tells me that normally, employees of King Stockholm were fairly quiet about company issues or complaints. But not this time. It seemed like <em>everyone</em> was talking about this, with a number of posts about the change popping up in the Stockholm general Slack channel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had no bargaining power,” she says. “I mean, if we had a CBA in place, we could have had a chance to try to negotiate and talk to our employer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no recourse available, Falck suggested spinning the union Slack channel back up, and suddenly the channel was flooded with interest, eventually reaching 217 members by the time I spoke to her. Over the next several months, the newly-energized group made plans and contacted representatives at Unionen. And in October of 2024, the group officially voted to form a union club with a union board at King Stockholm. [IGN reached out to Microsoft and Activision Blizzard King for comment for this piece, but did not receive a response.]</p><h2 data-cy="title2">No gods, only King</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its official formation, the King union has met with Activision Blizzard HR a few times to discuss how the two groups will communicate going forward, and Falck says their response has been “neutral.” This was to be expected, given the legal protections for unions in Sweden. But Microsoft has also publicly committed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u>taking a “neutral approach” toward unions</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized"><u>reports from other</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-vote-to-form-largest-us-video-game-worker-union-to-date"><u>newly-formed unions</u></a> within the company seem to indicate it’s following through with that globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Falck says she and the other union members are clear-eyed about the fact that it’s too late to get their private doctor benefit back, much less the same beloved doctor that was so popular among staff. But she says it is an expectation that they will eventually bargain with the company to obtain a CBA that will protect other popular benefits from being pulled out from under them in the same way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it comes down to being able to protect the [benefits] that we have with agreements to make sure that they don't do changes without us having influence and being able to negotiate changes,” she says. “That's where everyone was at when this benefit was taken away, because we have some benefits that are kind of unique. They're not super unique to the game industry, but they're quite unique as a whole to companies in Sweden. Like we have a bonus, we have all these things like benefits from Microsoft that are quite good. So we want to make sure we get those protected so if things are going to change, we can at least try to fight that or get it somewhat bulletproof for the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other important issues Falck mentions may come up are salary and information transparency at the company, as well as protection and transparency around company reorganizations and, critically, layoffs. But most importantly for Falck and her colleagues is the ability to influence their workplace for the good of everyone. As Unionen Stockholm organizer Timo Rybak explains:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The whole idea of unionizing in Sweden is based on the fact of both parties having influence and getting to the table to discuss matters,” he says. “It's employees helping their employer have knowledge of the everyday work, which is entirely unavailable to any company president, or any HR representative for that matter, [who are] not a game developer [and don’t] do the daily work of every single employee. That's just impossible. So giving all of those people a say and a seat at the table, well, that's just a positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Labor law in Sweden is still skewed towards the employer, their rights are greater than those of employees. But of course, what rights you do have as an employee, you should be protecting and be aware of and that kind of ties into the fact that unionizing is also a way of learning your rights, and especially in an industry like game development or IT at large, which has a very large community of immigrant workers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Falck points out that the union has already seen the benefits of simply sharing information on employee rights, saying that a large number of European and American game developers have come to work at King over the years and don’t necessarily understand what they’re entitled to. Organizing has enabled them to share information and educate one another on their rights as employees to better enable them to advocate for themselves individually, and as a group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Falck and her colleagues, forming a union club at King may have started as a backlash to an unpopular change. But its purpose is ultimately to protect the things they love about a job they care deeply about. “It's just a completely different world and a different company that we're getting used to. So we want to protect what is King, what is the culture, what are the benefits.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Renegade Game Studios is no stranger to concocting such a thing, and one of its latest creations brings together the tech of Cybertron and high-stakes racing board games with the brand-new release Robo Rally: Transformers.</p><div catalogid="d7122cb8-a821-479b-b295-e48bd6388b18" id="214116"><div id="214116" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Robo Rally: Transformers</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Robo Rally: Transformers is an adaptation of Richard Garfield’s (yes, the guy who created Magic: The Gathering) 1994 classic Robo Rally. The new game sees some fan favorite Autobots and Decepticons dropped into the rally race. Based off Avalon Hill’s 2016 <a href="https://zdcs.link/akRWlW?object_uuid=3d11cded-9bd3-4fac-adb6-e84048f98b2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">revised release of the game</a>, Robo Rally is a programming title that tasks you and up to five other players to race around a course to reach various checkpoint flags, before taking home the goal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To do this, you play cards in a sequence that dictates the actions you take, from moving to turning in a different direction and more. Each player reveals one of their cards, with everyone taking their action and seeing how the moves resolve. This new version adds a handful of unique mechanics and features pulled from the Transformers property that Ratchets (see what I did there?) everything up a notch, including transforming into your bot’s alt mode, shooting, and even new Cybertronian hazards to watch out for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robo Rally Transformers includes six choices of bots for players to pick from: Optimus Prime, Blurr, and Arcee, representing the Autobots; and Megatron, Drag Strip, and Flamewar for the Deceptions. Each of the Cybertronian contestants is outfitted with a unique ability and three special upgrades they can equip, further boosting their abilities in both robot and alt modes. All are represented by impressively detailed plastic minis, each in a unique color and shaded to help bring out those glorious robot details. As a whole, the production quilting on display here with Robo Rally Transformers is top-notch, something that I have come to expect out of Renegade Games products – they make good stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who tends to be the “teacher” of games, I always appreciate board games that can be taught relatively quickly with even brand new players being able to grasp the majority of how a game works by the end of a turn or two. Robo Rally Transformers, I am happy to report, fits comfortably into that category. The basic systems like how the cards work is painless and straightforward with card actions being simple to grasp, such as “Move 1/2/3” or “Turn Right/Left,” with effects from the upgrade cards being only a slight step up in terms of complexity to understand. The biggest hurdle is keeping track of what the various tiles do, but the game comes with a handy player aid to clear up that confusion, though it would have been nice if more than a single aid were included, perhaps enough for each player to get one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The box contains a number of double-sided boards that can be used to build a wide variety of maps to race around on. They vary in complexity and optimal player counts, with some that are great on their own or work best when paired with additional boards. The instruction booklet includes a number of layout recommendations that are fun to play, with even the beginner introductory configuration providing a good time for players to test their metal on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games I played, I never found a configuration that I didn’t enjoy and the modularity let me build my own levels too, once I got used to the systems. This adds a great deal of replayability to the game. I had an especially good time making truly devilish and hazardous maps to navigate around, which resulted in a number of hilarious situations of folks being shoved into laser beams, falling into lava pits, or blasted by a bunch of players all at once. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robo Rally Transformers is one of those games that I think gets better the more players you add, thanks to how all the characters can play and interact with one another, throwing the whole game into a frenetic and unpredictable gauntlet. The more characters on the board, the larger of an influence (and bigger disruptions) anyones’ actions can have on one anothers. A single person pumping into someone else, causing them to rotate, or sent into someone else early on, can cause a snowball effect for the rest of the round as their pre-planned actions were based on the position and rotations they <em>should</em> have been at.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Robo Rally Transformers is one of those games that I think gets better the more players you add.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all makes for some hilarious moments, but also frustrating ones, if your plans to reach one of those coveted checkpoints crumbles at the last moment.

As someone who hasn’t yet played the base or original versions of Robo Rally, I’m still able to see why this is a franchise that has stayed around for thirty years. The mixture of planning your moves and tense anticipation as you wait to see if your strategy will play out as you want makes for terrific board gaming. The addition of Transformers, with their alt modes, special upgrades, and new level hazards, adds a whole new layer in the tried-and-true formula that makes this package a great offering for new and old fans alike. Thanks to its more beginner-friendly setup options, you will know pretty quickly whether or not it’s a game for you, but if you can embrace and thrive in the chaos – and love Transformers – there's plenty of fun to be had here.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, more new products from the Scarlet &amp; Violet—Prismatic Evolutions lineup will be launching in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’d like to thank the community for their continued support and patience as we work to deliver this highly anticipated expansion to fans."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is welcome news for the Pokémon TCG community, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-deals-im-grabbing-these-pokmon-tcg-etbs-before-they-sell-out">which has been struggling to secure preorders and new release products</a> since the Pikachu-focused "Surging Sparks" expansion on 8 November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stock does seem to be slowly flooding the market, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-deals-pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-in-back-in-stock-and-im-buying-now">Surging Sparks restocks, including Elite Trainer Boxes, still on sale in the UK</a> at the time of writing at Amazon.

		<p>Rebellion know more than anyone how satisfying it is to blow the nuts off a Nazi. While that might not particularly trailer-friendly fare, it’s safe to say we all know that’s the first thing that anyone is doing when Sniper Elite: Resistance launches on the 30th of January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. The second thing you might want to do is indulge in some of the all-new features that Rebellion are bringing to bear in this entry in the storied series, with a fresh new trailer here to give a deeper dive into them all.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfhRzW2lUfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, there’s a new Operative in the shape of Harry Hawker – excellent alliteration there – and an all-new threat for you to overcome, and you can enjoy shooting Nazi’s in whatever body part you choose in either solo or online co-op. Bring a friend, then you can shoot Nazi’s in two places.</p>
<p>There’s also the new Propoganda missions, which are individually unlocked by discovering Propaganda posters hidden within the main Campaign. This new game mode lets you play as a Resistance fighter in thrilling quick-fire challenges against the clock and they look very cool indeed.</p>
<p>This is currently the only aspect of the game that we haven’t been able to check out, as Tef has been hands-on with it at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">Gamescom ’24</a> and at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-spending-the-night-in-lyon/">another event</a>. He came away suitably impressed, calling it “Stealth action comfort food”, before continuing, “Sniper Elite: Resistance will give another batch of good ol’ Sniper Elite action. It’s solid and dependable, and it’s always gruesomely amusing to see the series’ staple X-ray kill cam trigger as you explode someone’s testicles from the other side of the map.”</p>

<p>So there you have it. Watch the trailer, find your comrade, and prepare to shoot some Nazis in the nuts on the 30th of January, 2025.</p>

			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-legend-of-the-nomad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resumed</a> publishing developer diaries for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The new entry is solely dedicated to the protagonist, the enigmatic <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-protagonist-phyre-unveiled-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elder vampire Phyre</a>, and their so-called Nomad's legacy. According to the narrative's background, Phyre is really old and left a big mark on history, creating all sorts of legends that various characters in Seattle will have heard of.&nbsp;During multiple conversations, players will have the opportunity to shape their character's legacy, as outlined by Senior Narrative Designer and Writer Sarah Longthorne:</p>
<p><em>Importantly, we have chosen not to do this up-front in the style of Bloodlines 1, because this history is a choice as much as any other in the game, and a choice is most effective once you know the stakes. It should make you umm and ahh, maybe even agonise a little: What will happen to X if I choose Y? As such, it was important to us to have these choices occur once play has already begun, once you have started to feel your way around Seattle and its various dangers. These will come in waves — some ‘golden path’, others optional (for instance, if you choose to spend more time with and open up to certain characters) — each tackling a different aspect of your legacy which, tapestried together, suggest a more bespoke story.</em></p>
<p><em>The first thing we establish is the theme. Who does the Nomad say they are? A legendary warrior? A curious traveler? Or a desperate survivor, fleeing disaster to disaster to avoid their foes? Once this is chosen, we branch out into further options — each unique to that choice — which both refine roleplay and drill further into that initial theme with your motivation. These sub-choices layer in more texture, allowing your mind to play it all out like a movie and start filling in the details. Later, you’ll have other opportunities to further fill out this narrative, even (if you wish) touching on details that preceded or even caused your embrace.</em></p>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/6.__In-game_screenshot_of_Safia_discussing_the_Legend_of_the_Nomad.-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The player's choices in Bloodlines 2 will trickle down to following conversations, possibly even much later in the story. Moreover, they will influence the endings, which will be shown through stylized cinematics that mix images of Seattle with character shapes, inspired by True Detective. According to the developers, there are nearly 40 images for all the different finales in the game. A map of all the endings had to be made so that they could see how they connected, and the concept team used this to create a series of storyboards and choose the right images for each ending shot.</p>
<p>The next Bloodlines 2 developer diary is slated to go live on the official website on January 29. The game still has no release window, although Paradox Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed hope</a> it would launch in the first half of the year, while also clarifying that a potential third installment would be licensed to a third party rather than developed in-house.</p>

The sequel to 2018's<em> God Of War, Ragnarök</em> is a bigger and often better open-world action game that tells an epic story about the end of the world, gods fighting each other, and a father learning to let his son grow up.

This was a PS2 and Wii game released in 2009 (a very late PS2 game) that wasn’t great and was quickly forgotten. But hey, it never got an Xbox port, so its sort of Sony’s own exclusive Indiana Jones game. It’s not as good as last years <em>Great Circle</em>, which will land on PS5 in 2025, but hey, its something! </p><hr><p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p><h2 id="h7778"><a id=""></a>PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>God of War Ragnarök</em>| PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Atlas Fallen: Reign Of Sand </em>| PS5</li><li><em>SD Gundam Battle Alliance</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> | PS4</li><li><em>ANNO: Mutationem</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Orcs Must Die 3</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Poker Club</em> | PS4</li></ul><h2 id="h7779"><a id=""></a>PlayStation Plus Premium</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Medievil 2</em>| PS4, PS5</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s the new year, and it seems as though game developers believe that in amongst all that spring cleaning and remodelling you’ll fancy a bit of digital renovation as well. Following this week’s earlier announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/learn-how-to-design-a-house-with-architect-life-a-house-design-simulator/">Architect Life: A Design Simulator</a>, it’s now the turn of your derelict local sports hall, with Sports Renovations from Goat Gamez set to arrive on March 27th for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPORTS RENOVATIONS - Release date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfU2BjKMeAI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Published by Dear Villagers, Sports Renovations will set you on the path to sports-hall remodelling stardom, as you find yourself tasked with fixing up a series of dingy, broken and graffitied arenas and training facilities, using a variety of tools to bring them back up to code and ready for the next generation of sports stars to begin their journey.</p>
<p>There’s a heap of different tools available to you, nabbing a little pinch of Powerwash Simulator to help you clean things down, while providing you with what looks to be an oh-so-satisfying vacuum cleaner to suck up debris. Beyond that there’s a bucket for you to put rubbish in, and plenty of paint for you to daub on the walls of your facility. </p>
<p>The trailer showcases just how grimy things are when you start out, and the possible end product too, with gleaming new facilities that look absolutely fantastic. You get to design and lay everything out inside your venue too, placing rowing machines, exercise bikes and weight racks in just the right spot for your imaginary gym buddies.</p>


<p>The additional content here looks stellar, and there’s reams of historical sports memorabilia from posters through to trophies and even radio broadcasts to give you a window into sports history that’s unlike anything else out there. This sounds like an amazing idea, and I can’t wait to check it out when the game releases on the 27th of March.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps-plus-gets-god-of-war-ragnar%C3%B6k-like-a-dragon-gaiden-atlas-fallen-reign-of-sand-and-more-in-january.1083138/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-gets-god-of-war-ragnarok-like-a-dragon-gaiden-atlas-fallen-reign-of-sand-and-more-in-january/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has just unveiled the PS Plus lineup for January 2025. It's looking like a great month for subscribers of the Premium and Extra tiers, who will obtain access to games like Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarök, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Deck13's Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand, among others.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest title of the bunch is God of War Ragnarök. A direct sequel to the 2018 masterpiece that redefined an already popular series, God of War Ragnarök successfully maintained the same narrative excellence of the previous installment while delivering a lot more content and new gameplay mechanics. It received a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>God of War Ragnarök is exactly what we hoped for, and even more. It offers a masterfully told story using a more mature approach, seasoned with a unique setting, a rich characterization of the characters, and challenges that can keep even hardcore gamers busy at the highest difficulties. In other words, it is a title that is simply just too good to be missed.</em></p>
<p>The second big game on this month's PS Plus list is Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which Launched in November 2023 as a spin-off of the main series where original Yakuza protagonist Kazuma Kiryu embarked on a new adventure as a secret agent. Taking place roughly at the same time as Yakuza: Like a Dragon, it served as a bridge towards Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where Kazuma returned as a protagonist alongside Ichiban Kasuga. The game got a 7.8 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-what-is-dead-may-never-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name&nbsp;is a bite-sized appetizer meant to satisfy players' appetites for just a few more months until Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits global shores. That being said, Gaiden hits all the marks I want to see in the series: amusing side stories, an epic crime drama that spans multiple games, and all the knuckle shuffles one could ever want.</em></p>
<p>The third big-budget title featured in the January 2025 PS Plus lineup is Deck13's action RPG Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand. This one didn't exactly thrive at launch, though the developers kept working on the game and improved it a few months ago with a sizable update. Here's an excerpt from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-reign-of-sand-enhanced-and-improved-but-still-lacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our updated review (scored 7.3</a>):</p>
<p><em>With welcome improvements, quality of life changes, and new content, Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand enhances the game developed by Deck13. However, the update mainly improves the game's existing strengths and fails to address the core issues with its combat system. As a result, the update delivers only partial improvements, leaving those dissatisfied with the game's floaty and unsatisfying combat still wanting more.</em></p>
<p>The remaining titles PS Plus subscribers are getting on January 21 are either indies or niche games, such as SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Sayonara Wild Hearts, ANNO: Mutationem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/orcs-must-die-3-reinforcing-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orcs Must Die 3</a>, Citizen Sleeper, and Poker Club. Lastly, the Premium tier is also being expanded with two classics: MediEvil II and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.</p>

            <p>My feelings about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forest-reigns">Forest Reigns</a> are equal parts enthusiasm and disappointment, inflation and deflation, straight off the back of the announcement trailer. On the one hand, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">a fan of weird forests</a>, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.</p><!--more-->

<p>The game's reigning forest isn't "just part of the environment," intones <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/">the Steam page</a>, but "a conscious entity with its own desires and intentions". You will "interact with it to reveal its mysteries, use it for defeating enemies, or face its wrath as it reacts to your choices". So far, your choices seem mostly to consist of "shoot it/don't shoot it". The trees don't like being shot, which seems a bit elementary as "desires and intentions" go. I don't want to talk to them, necessarily, but their objecting to being pumped full of AK47 rounds doesn't feel very mysterious.</p>
<p>There's the suggestion of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis">Gaia theory</a> going on here, but the act of blasting volatile glowy bits or luring plants into strangling foes just look like variations on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>'s exploding oil drums and baitable predators. Still, that isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself, and it's possible you'll develop more of a relationship with the trees than can really be shown in an edited gameplay overview. Fingers crossed.</p><p>I don't think this is open world, but it's advertised as non-linear and mission-based, with factions you can cooperate or compete with to unlock different story outcomes. There's also a crafting system and a variety of guns to modify and coo over. Hah, I bet some of those guns are made out of wood, aka trees. I bet the trees don't like that either. So unreasonable.</p>
<p>Forest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a> doesn't have a release date. While you wait for one, let me try to lead you into the undergrowth with talk of other tree-themed games. The obvious and most horrible one is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a>. It makes the trees in what I've seen of Forest Reigns look like the cute, geometric palms from Sonic The Hedgehog. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witch-strandings">Witch Strandings</a>, a curious Kojima homage from Strange Scaffold, and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-devour">Roots Devour</a>, in which you are a tree that drinks blood.</p>

This is happening in stark contrast to <em>Overwatch 2</em>, which has seen steady decline even before the sequel launched without most of its promised features. As <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ momentum grows, fans of <em>Overwatch 2</em> are in their feelings about leaving behind what was once the biggest game in the world.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As a years-long <em>Overwatch </em>fan, I feel the same way. <em>Overwatch 2 </em>entered its 14th season in December, and I have barely touched it. I enjoyed what little time I spent with the new tank hero Hazard, but a whole new hero shooter that felt fresh was a few button presses away on my PlayStation 5. My friends are playing <em>Marvel Rivals </em>regularly and are excited to do so, rather than requiring the weeks or months of my begging to have them begrudgingly play <em>Overwatch</em> for an hour. This will probably be the first time I don’t finish a battle pass in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s lifetime. But I can’t lie, I miss <em>Overwatch</em>’s heroes.

In the face of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ success, <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s offerings feel even more paltry, and fans have taken notice.</p><p>The shift is palpable. While we can’t see concurrent players across all platforms, there are signs that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is eclipsing <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s audience, such as the stark gap between the two in streaming numbers.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2 </em>has work to do if it wants to reclaim this ground. Right now, Blizzard is testing a 6v6 format akin to the original game, which has some fans interested in a return to the series’ roots. But there’s still a fair bit of stink on <em>Overwatch 2 </em>after Blizzard failed to deliver the game it announced in 2019. Without a sense of forward momentum, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>feels stagnant, and lackluster skins and cosmetics aren’t enough to overtake <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. This has resulted in a lot of <em>Overwatch </em>fans in a weird limbo of not wanting to say goodbye but not having much reason to go back. Still, I can’t help but look at the Soldier: 76 statue on my shelf and feel like I’m grieving a long-time relationship.</p><p>Despite all my issues with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, on a strictly mechanical level I think it’s probably the better game. Heroes are more balanced, the map design is more consistent, and as divisive as it might be, I love having Role Queue in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, meaning I can guarantee there will be healers on my team. But that broken chaos has also been what has made <em>Marvel Rivals </em>feel fresh. If <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s future doesn’t include the promised PvE modes, I don’t know what the game’s future looks like. Hopefully, now that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is breathing down its neck, Blizzard will have a promising update in the coming months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
