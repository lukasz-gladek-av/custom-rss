            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e52bc8cecf5d2"><a title="Metroid Prime Title Screen" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e52bc8cecf5d2/metroid-prime-title-screen.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> has one of the best title screens ever.</p>
<p>It starts off with edge-lit glimpses and silhouettes, a bit like a Bond intro. But instead of naked bodies and <em>wait-was-that-a-nipple,</em> there’s something grotesque and alien and impressively FMV in the darkness.</p>
<p>There’s those classic Prime-y choir synths, which might be the mournful sounds of an ancient civilisation, or just a planet’s history given voice.</p>
<p>And the text comes with such <em>awesome</em> panning and scanning and general UI maximalism, with this honeycombed screen texture and skittering letters flicking on and off — some of the letters from <em>Retro Studios Game</em> become <em>Metroid</em> — and noises that are part hacking, part insectoid trills, with a heartbeat sound underneath.</p>
<p>The choir goes one note higher for the fourth note, there are two more lub-dub pulses before a crucial beat of silence, and then <em>that drop</em> of the main theme, clear and bright - a signal from space. Then the best bit! That weird shimmer-shudder sound as the Metroid Prime 2 title enters the screen. You can feel it in your ASMR gland.</p>

<p>And don't get me started on the sense of epic heroism from raising the last two notes of the phrase when the melody gets repeated.</p>
<p>So much of the Prime series’ appeal is here. The mood, the music, the mechanical scanning and interfacing with worlds historic and natural, and you've not even pressed Start! (You should press Start.)</p>
<p>But maybe you like the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Prime</a> one more; the eerie crackle and fade-in of <em>Nintendo and Retro Studios presents</em>, the Lucozade orange that might be a Metroid's innards, the spooky version of the main theme.</p>
<p>The 2023 remaster 'fixes' the short animation cycle so that the tendril sways up and down but it looks a bit silly. That abrupt VHS loop in the original had the sinister feel of found footage, like the scene of a crime.</p>
<p>But the title screen was more than just a flashy entry point, a nice hallway to the house (read: deadly planet). It set the tone, framed the game. And in my memory, it’s now part of the game’s texture and movement: When you press Start, it does that little swing into a different part of the Metroid (with more bioelectric fizzing), and then after choosing your save, there’s that swooping guided tour and slow fade-out.</p>

<p>This sequence of that spacey intro theme followed by the more upbeat choral blare of the file select, before Samus emerges to that iconic five-note fanfare, is a cadence as inseparably linked in my mind as the track sequence on an album. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4">In The End</a> comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t2WkCudwfY">A Place For My Head</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, I’ve not even played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3</a> and yet I somehow ‘remember’ the title screen, probably just from some YouTube archaeology. But it still stuck because it <em>rocks</em>, with that tragic, vaguely female siren synth and an ink blot of infestation across text that's gelled together like cells.</p>
<p>Recognisably Prime, with that meld of the organic and the technological, and you can forgive that too-long fade-to-black and the goofy font of ‘Corruption’ because in the second bit of the tune there's that desperate high note wail as the <strong>Terminator</strong> drums kick in.</p>

<p>So good. Who even needs to play the game?! (I do, Nintendo - please release those remasters.)</p>
<p>But then again, maybe you prefer the 2D Metroid title screens, and I can respect that.</p>
<p>You might like the cinematic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, with its alarm shrill escalation before that full-screen reveal of bodies deathly still beside a moving (but still caged?) Metroid at the centre, the thick bass coming in waves like a planet’s pulse.</p>
<p>Or the stars and surface of OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Zero Mission</a>, beginning with the crust of the world before the adventure beneath. Or the impressively creepy off-key dissonance of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid 2</a> one, that progresses to a tune that includes the low health alarm as a sample/anxiety trigger. Wild!</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer the straighter Metroid font used in the Mercury Steam games, without the skew that gives it that <strong>Star Wars</strong>-intro sense of vastness and adventure. (Why would you prefer this?)</p>


<p>Some people are apprehensive about Prime 4 because of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-open-world-confirmed">a motorbike in a PS2 desert</a>, which is fair, I guess. I think it looks rad personally, and am excited for the prospect of more Prime. More of that slow-grow of knowledge and abilities, the weighty feeling of squelch and scrunch as you traipse through gorgeous biomes, the organic curve of alien architecture.</p>
<p>But also the pleasure of engaging with something so gorgeous and evocative that I might still think about its title screen 20 years later.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 23 Jobs with unique abilities that determine what each Job can do. With so many choices available and ample customization options, choosing the best Jobs to win battles with ease can be overwhelming. With our tier list, however, you can easily learn which Jobs provide the highest damage and the best utility.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, but the ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings.</strong></em></p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-job-tier-list" data-level="2">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job Tier List</a><ul><li><a href="#h-s-tier" data-level="3">S Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-a-tier" data-level="3">A Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-b-tier" data-level="3">B Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-c-tier" data-level="3">C Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-d-tier" data-level="3">D Tier</a></li></ul></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-job-tier-list">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job Tier List</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job tier list. Created with <a href="https://tiermaker.com/">TierMaker</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Top-tier Jobs. Extremely versatile, powerful, or broken. They excel in multiple roles and remain strong throughout the game.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Strong Jobs. Very effective in most situations but slightly less versatile or powerful than S-tier. </td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Mid-tier Jobs. Situationally strong and useful.</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Low-tier Jobs. Supportive with limited usability, but solid as secondary Jobs.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Bottom-tier Job. Outclassed by every other Job.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Ninja is among the best Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ninja</strong> - The king of physical damage. Thanks to its unrivaled speed growth and innate Dual Wield ability (allowing two attacks per turn), the Ninja can act first and deliver very high damage. In addition, the Dual Wield support ability is the most crucial skill for nearly every physical-focused endgame build. Its only drawback is its low HP, making it a glass cannon that constantly needs support.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Monk</strong> - An indispensable, versatile physical Job. The Monk is a self-sufficient Job that needs no weapons to deal massive damage, as its attacks scale with its excellent Physical Attack and Brave stats. Its Martial Arts skill set is among the game's best utility kits, offering free, instant-cast healing and MP regeneration (Chakra), resurrection (Revive), and ranged physical attacks (Aurablast/Shockwave).</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetician</strong> - One of the most broken Jobs in the game. Its unique Arithmetic skill allows for instant-cast, map-wide magic with zero MP cost, bypassing casting time and range limits. It requires heavy JP investment and a high-Faith unit, so it takes more effort to make it effective than Ninja and Monk. Although its damage has been nerfed in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the Arithmetician is still a devastating Job that can clear entire maps solo with the proper setup.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Samurai offers superior versatility in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Samurai</strong> - A powerful hybrid job. While its physical attacks are standard, though they can be improved with the Doublehand Support Ability, the Iaido Job Command provides versatile magic-based abilities like area-of-effect healing, elemental damage, and buffs without consuming MP, at the potential cost of the katana used to activate the skill. Its signature Reaction Ability, Shirahadori, grants high evasion rates against physical attacks, making it a staple for any build.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Chemist </strong>- The most efficient support class in the game, available from the start. The Item Job Command has zero casting time and can instantly heal, restore MP, or revive allies from a distance, bypassing the Faith mechanics and casting times of spells. The Auto-Potion Reaction Ability and the Support Ability Throw Item are crucial for survivability, making the Chemist a great choice as a secondary Job as well.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Black Mage</strong> - The main offensive spellcaster in the game, specializing in high-damage, area-of-effect elemental magic. The Black Mage has the best Magic Attack growth among the standard magic-based Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, allowing its spells to deal massive damage throughout the adventure. Its main weakness is the long casting time, which may cause involuntary friendly fire. Its Magic Attack Up Support Ability is also essential for every other magic-based Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Time Mage</strong> - The master of turn manipulation. The Time Mage's abilities, such as Haste and Slow, are critical for gaining a decisive advantage. Support ability Swiftness is a fundamental ability for any serious spellcaster, although less than in other versions of the game due to faster casting time for some spells. The Movement Ability Teleport, which ignores height and terrain restrictions, provides excellent mobility that works great for most Jobs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Although far from being one of the best Jobs, the Dancer is a solid choice in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Geomancer </strong>- A highly versatile class that uses Geomancy, which are instant-cast spells tied to the terrain. These spells always hit, can inflict a variety of status effects, and scale off of both Physical Attack and Magic Attack while ignoring Faith, which is great for hybrid builds. The Attack Up Support Ability is an essential skill for all physical damage-based classes.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mystic </strong>- A magic caster specializing in Mystic Arts, spells that inflict status effects and permanently raise or lower a unit's Bravery and Faith stats. Although it falls off during the late game due to an optional, much better character, this Job works decently as a secondary Job for units with high Faith. The Defense Boost Support Ability also gives it better survivability on the frontlines.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dancer </strong>- A special female-only class that uses Dance abilities to cast debuffs on all enemies with a 50% success rate. Though fragile and focused on support, some of the Dance abilities are extremely useful, such as Forbidden Dance to cause random status afflictions, and Last Waltz to reduce enemies' CT to 1. This makes the Dancer a solid choice in some scenarios where debuffing the enemy is more important than going straight for damage.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mime </strong>- A powerful but very situational Job that can learn no skill. The Mime's only action is to perfectly replicate the last non-Mime action taken by any friendly unit on the battlefield, which makes them devastating if paired with an Arithmetician, but also tricky to use in scenarios where one isn't available. Its excellent stat growth is offset by its high unlock requirements.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dragoon </strong>- A physical fighter and excellent tank with high HP and access to heavy armor and shields. Their signature command, Jump, launches the unit into the air, making them untargetable for a short time before they come down for a powerful, high-range attack. Their low speed, Jump charge time, and lack of versatility, however, impact their usefulness compared to other physical-oriented Jobs that can deal more damage more quickly.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Summoner </strong>- A strong magic-based Job that can deal elemental damage at a wider AoE than the Black Mage. The high charge time of some spells and their high MP cost, however, require way more upkeep than the Black Mage, resulting in a still viable, but less effective Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mediator </strong>- A unique support-focused Job that provides buffs and debuffs via the Speechcraft abilities and can naturally equip Guns. Though essential for recruiting monsters, there are Jobs that do what it does in a more effective way. </li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though generally useful, the White Mage is quickly outclassed by other Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>White Mage</strong> - A support-focused Job specializing in restorative and protective magic, offering single-target and AoE healing, defensive buffs, and even damage with the Holy spell. Although useful, a Magic Attack-focused Samurai build outclasses White Mages at what it does best, making it a good choice only for some experimental builds, like a Dragoon hybrid build that takes advantage of its solid speed growth to make Jump more effective.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Knight </strong>- A durable physical job with high HP, strong Physical Attack, and access to heavy armor and shields. The Arts of War abilities have some utility in certain scenarios, but other Jobs are more effective at debuffing without engaging enemies head-on. Also, a late-game special character's unique skills completely outclass the Arts of War abilities with guaranteed success, relegating endgame Knights to being tanks and not much else.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Thief</strong> - A high-speed, high-mobility Job whose Steal command is the only way to obtain some rare weapons and gears. Due to their low damage output and low HP, the Thief Job is a mediocre main Job, and works best as a secondary Job for other, better Jobs that can take better advantage of the Steal command and Movement +2 ability. </li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Squire</strong> - The starting job for all male units and the foundation for all physical melee classes, the Squire Fundamentals abilities can be put to great use by other Jobs, such as Focus for a Job like Monk. JP Boost, which increases Job Point gain, and Movement +1 are solid abilities for any Job, making the Squire a great secondary Job even in the late game. Its unspecialized nature and limited gear selection, however, make it a good choice as a main Job only at the beginning of the game.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bard </strong>- A special male-only class that uses Songs to cast buffs on all friendly units. Although not too different from the Dancer in function, debuffs have far more utility, making this Job worthwhile mainly to learn the Movement +3 ability, or in some special challenge runs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Even with some buffs, the Archer remains one of the worst Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Archer</strong> - As the only Job capable of equipping Bows, the Archer can extend its attack range with height. Unfortunately, this Job falls off very quickly even during the early game, due to its average Aim Job Command, which requires time to charge an attack to deal increased damage, and the low damage of Bows and Crossbows. The Concentrate Support Ability, which prevents attacks from being evaded, and Adrenaline Rush Reaction Ability, which increases speed when the unit receives damage, have some utility, but they are too little to prevent the Archer from being the worst Job in the game.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-reportedly-preparing-to-launch-a-free-version-of-xbox-cloud-gaming-with-ads.1315900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems that after hiking the prices for Xbox Game Pass by 50%, Microsoft isn't done making changes to its Xbox gaming services, as a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">The Verge</a> alleges that a new free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming is currently being internally tested, with a public test to be announced soon. The catch to this version being free is, unexpectedly, it'll be free *with ads.</p>



<p>How it'll work, according to The Verge, is that players will be able to stream free-to-play games, some games that players own, and a collection of Xbox Retro Classic titles. How the ads will work is that players will have to sit through two minutes of ads before they can stream a game, and they'll reportedly only get five free hours per month, in one-hour sessions.</p>



<p>It'll be available on PC, consoles, and handheld devices. The first public beta test is apparently coming "<em>soon</em>," with its full release set to be out "<em>in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>We've had hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-vp-hints-at-more-affordable-xbox-cloud-gaming/">Microsoft is looking to make Cloud Gaming "<em>more affordable</em>"</a> before, which could easily be seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">as the new price changes for Xbox Game Pass</a>. Yes, the price for the service went up by 50%, but you no longer have to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate to use Xbox Cloud Gaming, and can stream games through the cloud from the cheapest Essential tier.</p>



<p>This would go a step further, though it's worth considering who would be satisfied with one-hour sessions and a total of five hours across the span of a month. It feels like the kind of restriction that wouldn't exactly satisfy anyone who would want to stream games in the first place, pushing them to simply get an Essential Game Pass subscription for a reasonable experience.</p>



<p>Regardless, even with this tier being free, it's doubtful this would be met with enthusiasm and positivity from players. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">console price hike</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">removal of cost-saving features</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts for subscribers</a>, now likely followed by more ads being pushed in front of players just trying to play some games don't exactly make for a winning public reception. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Xbox is reportedly close to announcing a new ad-supported version of its game streaming service. Apparently, Microsoft has been internally testing ad-supported cloud streaming with employees, letting them play games without a <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">Game Pass</a> subscription.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">On October 3,<em> The Verge</em> reported</a> that sources familiar with Microsoft’s future plans have confirmed with the outlet that the tech giant will soon announce a new way to stream Xbox games without a Game Pass subscription. Currently, you need a Game Pass subscription to stream Xbox games. This new free streaming option will reportedly feature pre-roll ads that will appear before playing a game.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Xbox about this report.</p> <p><em>The Verge</em> further reports that sources with knowledge of the internal testing of the service say these ads are about two minutes long. There’s also a limit of one hour per session and about five hours max a month, though this might change if and when the service is rolled out to the public. It sounds like this upcoming free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will let folks stream some games you already own, some other select eligible games, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-retro-classics-app-activision-blizzard-games-free-1851781736">retro titles</a>.</p>

 <p>This new ad-supported free streaming option will be available on Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. Reportedly, Microsoft is planning to test out this new option via a public beta. A full rollout of the service will happen in the months that follow.</p> <p>It’s been a not-so-great week for Xbox Game Pass. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">On Wednesday</a>, Xbox announced a massive price increase for all tiers of Xbox Game Pass while also completely reorganizing and renaming parts of the popular subscription service. In doing so, Xbox made everything a bit worse and more expensive. The gaming giant also quietly announced that, unlike all other Xbox first-party games, future <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483"><em>Call of Duty</em> games would not migrate to Game Pass Standard within a year of launch</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">This all follows in the wake of Xbox raising the price of its consoles last month</a>, which was&nbsp;the second Xbox console price hike to happen in 2025.</p>

            <p>Following its early access launch, Skate's first season will arrive next week, bringing new areas, events, challenges, and more.</p>
<p>Called Hesh &amp; Fresh, the first season is inspired by the '90s and will run from 7th October until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six">mentioned last month</a>, the season will bring an updated lighting system to ensure the city of San Van is "more grounded and lived in", while the skate.Pass allows players to earn in-game seasonal currency (called Tix) with which to purchase cosmetic rewards.</p>

<p>Two events will be added this season. The first is Skate-o-Ween, based on Halloween (obviously) but with an emphasis on amusing outfits. It'll run from 21st October to 11th November.</p>
<p>That will be followed by the 7-Ply Maple Harvest from 18th November until 2nd December, calling back to the 70s and the wood used for skateboard construction at that time.</p>
<p>Both events will have community parks updated in celebration, as well as themed cosmetics.</p>
<p>The season will also add 40 new challenges rotating weekly, new brands in the in-game store, and 21 new songs from 90s artists like Bad Religion, Dinosaur Jr., Ice Cube, and more.</p>
<p>Skate arrived in early access last month and has so far proven a success, in particular with players sharing their stunts on social media.

<p>"After an absolute age, EA's wheelie classic is back with great handling and a whole world of slightly jarring niceness," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review">Skate early access review</a>.</p>
<p>Skate is published by EA, which this week announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">planned private acquisition by a group of investors</a> including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in a private transaction worth $55bn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed what you can expect from the first season of free-to-play skateboarding sim&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next week, and there are a ton of new cosmetics up for grabs, plus more.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official blog, the first season of&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>will bring two seasonal events with it, as well as "a little makeover" for San Vansterdam, lots of new challenges and objectives for you to pursue, and, of course, a brand new battle pass.</p>

<p>First up, it's the first of two seasonal events, Skate-o-Ween. It's San Vansterdam's annual Halloween celebration, but EA says it's "less focused on the spookiness" and "more about getting a chuckle out of someone". It runs from October 21st to November 11th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=9GkDyJ_V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=x-M6o5tQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s first season is bringing new stuff galore next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The second big event this season is the 7-Ply Maple Harvest, which begins on November 18th and ends on December 2nd. Both events will feature updated community parks, plus new themed cosmetics you can grab either via in-game challenges or by visiting the Extravert Shop.</p>

<p>Completing seasonal events will earn you event currency, and you can then use that currency to grab special cosmetic items. EA says it'll have more info about both events before they go live in&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>.</p>

<p>Season 1 will also bring new general cosmetics for you to earn outside of the specific seasonal events, but of course, the battle pass will have both a free and a premium track, and you'll have to cough up some cash if you want to get premium items.</p>

<p>It's not all about spending money, though; several new music tracks are also being added for Season 1, including the likes of Bad Religion's "Against the Grain", Jane's Addiction's "Stop!", and Gang Starr's "Full Clip", among others.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its first official season kicks off on October 7th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is getting ready to announce an ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the software maker has started testing ad-supported games streaming internally, allowing employees to play select titles free without a Game Pass subscription.</p><p>I understand that the free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will include the ability to stream some games you own, as well as eligible <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/tag/free-play-days/">Free Play Days</a> titles, which let Xbox players try games over a weekend. You’ll also be able to stream <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672037/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-activision-retro-classics">Xbox Retro Classics</a> games.</p><p>Sources tell me the internal testing includes around two minutes of preroll ads before a game is available to stream for free through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is also currently testing a limit of one hour for sessions, with up to five hours free a month. These limits may well change when the service is officially launched.</p><p>The ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming version will be available on PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices, and via the web. Microsoft is planning to test free streaming through a public beta test soon, before launching it fully in the coming months.</p><p>Microsoft’s free streaming test comes in the same week that the company expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming access to its Xbox Game Pass Premium and Essential plans for the first time, as part of a revamp to Game Pass and a 50 percent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/790658/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-console-price-hikes-notepad">price hike for Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes">came out of beta</a> this week. Game Pass Ultimate members can now stream select games in 1440p resolution, with up to 30Mbps bitrates. Ultimate subscribers also get up to 20Mbps bitrates for any other games streamed at 1080p. Premium and Essential subscribers are limited to 1080p resolution and a 12Mbps bitrate.</p><p>An ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming has been long in the works. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart first dropped hints about a free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">nearly two years ago</a>. Microsoft also made it clear recently that it wants to make Xbox Cloud Gaming more accessible.</p><p>“I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud,” Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of next generation, said on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint">Xbox podcast in August</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's inching closer to last thing UK time on a Friday, so my job is to bring you the single most devastating and depressing bit of news I can to get the weekend started right. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a>, the funky little game in which you play a house in search of a romantic connection with another building, has had its full release delayed to early 2026.</p>
<p>See, I told you it'd be devastating. A few months' extra wait until you can engage in more vaguely flirty banter with a windmill. I knew I should have insisted we develop some embeddable tissues which could be inserted into articles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It was a tough decision, but I wanted to give more time for the game to breathe -- to polish on the narrative and ensure that the game feels smooth," developer Tanat Boozayaangool wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2666920/view/526481129361900884?l=english">Steam post</a> about the delay. "I want to tell a meaningful story through this game, but right now, everything feels rushed. I'm thankful for the reception on this game so far, grateful for all the opportunities that the community has enabled for me.</p>
<p>"But looking at the game as a whole, it just needs a lil bit more time. This will also give the team time to work through bugs, optimization, and accessibility features to ensure that we launch with the best version of Building Relationships. Rest assured, that the end is in sight: the story arc has been set, the plot determined -- I just need to give it a bit more polish."</p>
<p>They then shared a teaser image of the player building sitting next to a windmill in a garden. COME ON, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING THE ADDED WAIT EASIER.</p>
<p>I digress. While I played the Steam demo for Building Relationships (which is still live if you want to dive in) after reading some <a href="https://www.vg247.com/building-relationships-steam-next-fest-demo-made-me-crush-on-a-windmill">Next Fest coverage Oisin wrote about it</a> back when both of us were at brash and occasionally funny RPS sister site VG247, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/building-relationships-is-a-short-hike-but-you-are-trying-to-chat-up-toy-houses">Edwin</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-happy-to-report-that-building-relationships-has-more-than-one-joke-and-most-of-them-are-pretty-good">Nic</a> have also written about it here. Here's an except from the former's piece that neatly sums out what the game's all about:</p>
<blockquote>Building Relationships stands out the most in hindsight because it felt the most at ease in its own skin and also, because it's not every day you get to chat up a small apartment building. (I personally wouldn't date an apartment building because all the ones I've lived in had mold, but this one had a certain forlorn charisma, reminiscent of that friend who's too busy pairing off everybody else to find love himself.) It's a pocket open worlder with boisterous katamari physics in which you bounce about fluttering your curtains at bungalows and completing very simple quests, such as fishing (in this case, for cars). It is a game wholly invested in the act of enjoying a pun, which is surely the definition of a promising first date. It has pleasantly daft writing, blossoming biomes that remind me of Proteus a bit, and some amusing camera angle choices during conversation.</blockquote>
<p>Right, I'm off to try and distract myself until early next year with some non-building related puns.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-digitally-erasing-guns-from-james-bond-posters.1315837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! It’s Friday, and I’m so happy because today is my last day before I go off on a two-week vacation. But before I leave, I have one more Morning Checkpoint for you all. Yup, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other cool stuff is back again, and this time we’re looking into the rumored <em>Halo</em> remake, mourning the death of AOL dial-up, and preparing for so many damn games to launch in October. Enjoy, and I hope you get to go on a vacation very soon. You deserve it.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon is erasing guns from old James Bond posters</strong></h2> <p>Here’s something strange. Amazon, the new owners of the James Bond franchise, are allegedly digitally erasing guns out of old promo images of various Bond actors and using those censored images on Prime Video. <a href="https://hmssweblog.wordpress.com/2025/10/03/altered-007-images-raise-fan-concern-about-amazon/">This was documented by 007 fan blog <em>The Spy Command,</em></a> and it’s all really silly, with some images simply cropped to hide a gun and others changed more drastically. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philnobilejr.bsky.social/post/3m2c4ko55zc2j">There’s also evidence that some of the images are being tweaked using AI tools.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <h2><strong>The rumored <em>Halo </em>remake is reportedly being developed by the <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> company</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/">As first reported by YouTuber Mr.Rebs and corroborated by XboxEra</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">previously reported but not yet announced remake of the original <em>Halo</em></a> is allegedly being developed by Abstraction Games, a studio owned by Virtuous.&nbsp; Virtuous is the same studio that developed this year’s smash hit RPG, <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 3</em>‘s promised offline mode has been canceled</strong></h2> <p><em>Payday 3</em> launched in 2023 to negative reviews, and players flocked back to <em>Payday 2 i</em>nstead. Since then, the devs have been trying to improve the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-solo-offline-mode-beta-update-june-27-heist-pc-1851560236">In June 2024</a>, the studio behind the game launched a pseudo-offline mode that still required the internet. At the time, it was called a “stepping stone” to a true offline mode. Well, that’s not actually going to happen after all.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/as-if-things-werent-bad-enough-payday-3-has-canceled-its-promised-offline-mode/">As reported by <em>The Game</em></a><em>r</em>, during a recent livestream,<em> Payday 3</em>&nbsp;general manager Jonas Skantz confirmed that the studio wasn’t planning to make a true offline mode, claiming that adding the fan-requested feature “is not feasible for where we are going with the game.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Five of the most wishlisted games on Steam are launching in October</strong></h2> <p>We’ve talked a few times about how October is going to be a month packed with video game releases. And here’s more evidence of that. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/buckle-up-five-of-the-most-wishlisted-games-on-steam-are-all-coming-out-this-month/">As spotted by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> some of the most wishlisted games on Steam right now, including <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Little Nightmares 3,</em> are all launching in October. Good luck out there, folks.</p> <h2><strong>AOL’s dial-up internet service is officially dead</strong></h2> <p>*SCREECHING NOISES* *DIFFERENT LOUD NOISES* *DEEE DEEE DDEEEEE DOO DOO DOOOOOOO* Okay, finally online. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/aol-dial-up-internet-shuts-down-08162912737f2fb221f10ba87ce5fc41">Now to look up news about my internet provider AOL, and oh no….</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-toasty-guy-from-mortal-kombat-has-left-the-studio-after-30-years-2000631151">The Toasty! guy from<em> Mortal Kombat</em> has left the studio after 30 years</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">OpenAI’s new video tool is producing slop featuring copyrighted characters like Goku</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-build-masterpiece-mario-zelda-2000631059">Hey, the new Lego Game Boy is awesome and not very expensive</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to announce an ad-based version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, according to a new report. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's sources</a> said Microsoft is now testing an ad tier for the streaming service, with employees trying it out now before it may launch publicly for everyone.</p><p>The report said the free ad-based tier for Xbox Cloud Gaming will allow players to stream "some" of the games they already own, along with select titles from the "Free Play Days" promotion that allows people to play select titles on weekends at no cost. Xbox Retro Classics titles may be included, too.</p><p>In terms of the ads themselves, the report said the current iteration has people watching two minutes of preroll ads before jumping into a game. The report also mentioned that there could be streaming limitations, including a cutoff of one-hour sessions each and up to five hours for free each month. It's possible things change before the ad-based program goes live, if it does at all.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming version with ads is said to be in the works for PC, Xbox, handheld devices, and internet browsers. Prior to this report, an industry analyst said Microsoft might look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">offering people the ability to play games for free in exchange for watching ads.</a></p><p>An ad-based tier is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-for-free-microsoft-is-experimenting-with-ad-views-for-access-to-hundreds-of-xbox-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox boss Tim Stuart first hinted at it some time ago</a>. In August this year, Xbox boss Jason Ronald teased an evolution of Xbox Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying on a podcast</a> that Microsoft was looking for a way to make the service "more affordable" and "accessible," and dropping the price to $0 is in line with that ambition.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-exits-beta-with-some-improvements/1100-6535146/" data-ref-id="1100-6535146">Xbox Cloud Gaming left beta and added more improvements.</a> Additionally, Microsoft announced that the highest-quality streaming, 1440p, will be locked behind the Game Pass Ultimate paywall, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">the price just went up to $30/month.</a></p><p>Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p>

                <p>So, you're bored at work, probably sitting in front of your computer scrolling nothing to look busy. (Did I just snitch on myself?) Maybe you'd rather be playing Sucker Punch Productions' new samurai fantasy sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, but you've got however many hours until you get home. Well, if you wanted to make the wait easier, you should definitely check out the recently released "Music from Watanabe Mode" soundtrack. It's a total vibe.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is the PlayStation 5-exclusive sequel to 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Many things in Yotei are similar to Tsushima, but there are a few differences. One of them is the newly introduced Watanabe Mode, a collaboration with Samurai Champloo director Shinichirō Watanabe that features original lo-fi music created under his direction. You could only listen to these beats on your PS5 if you selected Watanabe Mode--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">one of three playable options</a> based on samurai film directors like Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike--but now, Sony has dropped the soundtrack on music streaming services.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_EoEz8oFso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4_EoEz8oFso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released on October 3--one day after Yotei hit PS5--<a href="https://ghostofyotei.lnk.to/watanabe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "Ghost of Yotei - Music from Watanabe Mode - EP"</a> houses nearly 30 minutes of chill beats to kill (time) to. You can listen to it just about everywhere: Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, YouTube Music, and a streaming service I've never heard of called Deezer.</p><p>It's a real chill vibe. If you're familiar with Samurai Champloo and the artists Watanabe collaborated with for that legendary anime's soundtrack, then you know what to expect from this brisk but banging EP. It could fit right in with an episode of SamCham, and really brings that lowkey energy to Yotei's vengeful scenarios. It's a nice juxtaposition between the serious and the calm.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched on PlayStation 5 to generally favorable reviews from critics. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling awarded it a 9/10, saying it "builds and improves upon its predecessor with a gripping story, rewarding exploration, and fantastic combat, with each aspect emphasizing the characteristics of a new protagonist." Now that it's finally out, we've been busting ass on a bunch of guides to make your time in 1600 Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido, Japan) easier. This includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-weapons-locations-guide/2900-7098/" data-ref-id="2900-7098">where all the weapons are</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-best-skills/2900-7091/" data-ref-id="2900-7091">the best skills to unlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-wolf-den-locations/2900-7102/" data-ref-id="2900-7102">how to find all the wolf dens</a>, and more, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/which-ghost-of-yotei-mode-should-you-play/2300-6466416/" data-ref-id="2300-6466416">which mode you should play</a>.

		<p>A few weeks on from the early access release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skate-4">Skate</a>, EA and Full Circle have now revealed what’s coming in Season 1: Hesh &amp; Fresh, kickflipping off on 7th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Mi9EKoBCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The free-to-play reboot of the popular extreme sport series, Skate has taken players to the skate park paradise of San Vansterdam. Now the city is getting even bigger with new locations, weekly challenges, a skate pass with both free and premium reward tracs, and seasonal events for Halloween and Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Skateable Areas</strong>: Find seasonal decor at spots like The Orb and The Skateway plus other new areas for you to discover throughout San Van.</li>
<li><strong>New Events:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skate-o-Ween (Oct. 21 – Nov. 11): </strong>Skate-o-Ween in San Van is a lighthearted Halloween celebration that’s less about the spook and more about getting a chuckle, creating an inventive costume and just skating in a fun outfit.</li>
<li><strong>7-Ply Maple Harvest (Nov. 18 – Dec. 2): </strong>The annual San Van 7-Ply Maple Harvest is a long-standing festival celebrating the city’s unique maple trees; in the 70s, skaters discovered that the trees’ wood were perfectly suited for skateboard construction. It’s a community tradition rooted in accomplishments, growth, and reflection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Challenges and Tasks: </strong>Season 1 will introduce 40 new Challenges that will rotate in and out weekly. Players can also take on all-new daily, weekly, seasonal and event Tasks to earn Tix and unlock fresh rewards.</li>
<li><strong>New Brand Partners and Soundtrack Additions: </strong>New brands are joining the in-game store, including NHS’s Santa Cruz, Independent and Creature. Season 1 also brings 21 new songs with a 90’s vibe – featuring tracks from Bad Religion, Dinosaur Jr., Ice Cube and more. The full track drops soon!</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Update and skate.Pass: </strong>Launching alongside Season 1 is the brand new Lighting Update and skate.Pass, which you can read more about in <strong><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six">The Grind Vol. 6.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Skate might technically be in early access, but the game is free-to-play and available across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-with-the-full-game-on-the-cart">A 'proper' physical</a> release for the game on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/yooka-replaylee-gets-a-launch-date-on-switch-2-full-physical-release-confirmed">was confirmed</a> when the digital launch was announced (which is much sooner - next week, in fact, on 9th October), but we can now ditch those placeholders in the knowledge that the Switch 2 cart will arrive on shelves in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>The physical version on all platforms comes with some extra goodies: a map and some stickers. Here's how the PR blurb puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This physical edition for Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PlayStation 5 includes the base game (with physical cartridge for Nintendo Switch 2), a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. All platform versions will be priced at $49.99 USD (SRP).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reworking is described as the "definitive rebuilt and enhanced version", which not only gives <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">the 2017 Kickstarter success</a> a significant glow-up for modern platforms, but also throws in a ton of new pagies, new minigames, remixed worlds, and an orchestral soundtrack featuring lush new arrangements of Grant Kirkhope, David Wise, and Steve Burke's tunes.</p>
<p>The team at Playtonic recently confirmed that the Switch 2 version would be running at 30fps, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yooka-replaylee-runs-at-30fps-on-switch-2-team-investigating-performance-mode">they've said</a> that they're "investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch".</p>

			<p>The multiplayer beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">now live in its early access period</a> for users who've pre-ordered the game and Xbox Game Pass subscribers. It'll be live for anyone who wants to check out the beta, not included in those two categories, on October 5, but even before it opens to the general public, reports have surfaced across social media that cheaters are running amuck through the game.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">Eurogamer</a>, after a bunch of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">talk from Treyarch and Activision about its new and improved anti-cheat</a>, which even goaded cheaters on by saying, "<em>Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear</em>," cheaters have taken up the challenge Activison put to them.</p>

<p>In fairness, the above clip comes from an account that<a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1973874240253489434"> Treyarch has already found and banned</a>, so the team is indeed doing its best to get rid of cheaters as they appear, but this doesn't say very much about the preventative measures, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">adding the same Secure Boot protections that Battlefield 6 has</a>, in Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Is it enough for Treyarch to ban these accounts after they've already gotten in-game and ruined a match or two? On one level, yes, as long as cheaters are being caught, then you could argue that's the anti-cheat protections working well. That said, the players who have their matches ruined by cheaters who are only caught after the fact might not feel that way.</p>



<p>As long as there are people playing multiplayer games, there will be those who will cheat, and it's a constant battle for developers to minimize the impact of cheaters as much as possible. But it's worth asking what these kernel-level measures are for if they're not even prepared for the opening hours of an annual beta test. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I don’t play <i>Helldivers 2</i> nearly as much as I should. But the last time I called in the stratagem that is installing the game through Steam, I sat in awe at the absurdly massive 141.51GB install size. My drives are perpetually overflowing with nonsense, so it really is a me problem. But seriously? Why the hell is this game so large? Thankfully, Arrowhead Game Studios has an answer.</p> <p>In a recent “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">Tech Blog</a>,” Arrowhead’s deputy technical director explained just why we all have to flinch at that colossal storage requirement upon installing or reinstalling <i>Helldivers 2</i> on PC. Turns out, it’s old, platter-based storage mediums with their slow, spinny discs to blame. Unlike more modern solid state drives that have evolved beyond the need for mechanical moving parts, hard-disk drives (HDDs) are really slow, and by duplicating various bits of data, you can improve performance for those on older hardware.</p>

 <p>So yeah, that massive install size actually represents multiple copies of the various bits of code that make up <i>Helldivers 2</i>. As the blog states, this is done to put essential data “in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.” This reduces the “seek time” an HDD needs to do to load up something. The blog continues:</p>

 <blockquote><p>For example, our build system will ensure that a copy of a tree texture is stored on the same part of the disk as the level geometry data. When the game loads the level, the read head can access all the necessary information on a single, continuous sweep, without having to “seek” to a different location. This dramatically speeds up loading times.</p></blockquote> <p>The blog spills some digital ink speculating whether or not, in 2025, saddling everyone with duplicated files is necessary–especially when common practice for building a PC has been to use an SSD for quite some time. Based on Steam user surveys, Arrowhead says it thinks about 12 percent of PC gamers on the platform still use old-school spinny drives. And since <i>Helldivers 2</i> is a multiplayer game, that means you want that 12 percent to also be loading into the game as fast as you are. So yeah, it’s not just about catering to these players specifically. It’s about making sure everyone, even those who don’t have access to a more modern drive, still has a good, speedy time. Real woke shit right there.</p> <p>That said, if you have an older machine and can’t afford a meatier graphics card or CPU upgrade yet, switching over to an SSD is one of the more affordable options for improving not just your gaming, but your entire machine’s performance. And hey, even a 512GB SSD is <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">cheaper than a year of Game Pass right now</a>.</p>
