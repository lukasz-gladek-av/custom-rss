			<p>There’s an ungodly number of new games released every week these days, and it’s a lot to just keep up with what’s coming out, let alone play them all. On top of the sheer volume of general chaff and nonsense we get served, there are also games that are very similar to something else, but with a couple of tweaks – just look at the bullet heaven genre that Vampire Survivors spawned. So, in amongst all of that, TankHead stands out as being quite refreshing. It’s not perfect, but it is novel, and that counts for a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="TankHead - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzYw01FIwUc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>TankHead is set in a world where mechs are actually humans that have infused their spirits into floating robots that then build tanks on their heads… I think. Alright, so basically people can project themselves into a little drone, and then use that drone to explore areas they wouldn’t normally be able to. Some people that do this get lost in the sauce a little bit though, and they become TankHeads, horrifying masses of technology and human spirit. The first one of these you meet is an enormous tanker with too many weapons, too many limbs, and a big old life bar. It’s seriously weird in a wonderful way.</p>


<p>You play as someone called Whitaker, who’s looking for a way to get into the Event Containment Area, the main area that people can’t go into. To that end, you hook your little drone up to a vehicle and just drive in there. Thankfully, considering what you’ll find in the ECA, that vehicle is actually a tank.</p>


<p>The majority of the game has you driving between objectives, getting into a few fights with some incredibly strange enemies, and then doing a little bit of scavenging to get more ammo, fuel, and new parts – you’ll need to hurry to grab them before they blow up, but can apply new parts in the field for an instant boost. It’s a nice mix-and-match of things to do, and while it can get old if you play for too long, each individual mission doesn’t ask too much of your time.</p>
<p>If you don’t succeed in doing all of your main objectives in any given mission, then you’ll be booted back to before you started, stripped of any new parts you found on your attempt and given the opportunity to rejig your tank before you try again, so long as you have enough funds. It’s a little bit extraction shooter, a little bit roguelike in that sense. You can also get permanent upgrades using chips you can find, which is a nice bit of progression.</p>

<p>The combat feels good for the most part, and while it quickly becomes clear that your only real strategy is strafing with your strongest armour toward the enemy and shooting back at them. The variety of enemies is good, whether it’s smaller spider-bots and drones or rival tanks of various designs, where you need to chip away at their armour to reveal weak spots. The AI can be a little simplistic, but it all comes together to be fairly satisfying and fun.</p>
<p>It all builds up to the huge spectacles of the boss battles, which really lean in on the bizarre kitbash vibe of the enemies and take them to new heights. You’ve seen the multi-legged walking building and flying stingray in the launch trailer, but there’s plenty more beyond these. The only downside is that, because the fundamental formula strafing to avoid damage while picking off armour to reveal weakspots doesn’t change, these can feel like a slog and bullet-spongey.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		TankHead is, overall, an enjoyable and interesting take on tank gameplay and on roguelike ideas. It looks fantastic, the story is compelling, and the world it's set in is very cool. I like it, but I don't love it. A bit more variety would have been nice, but in the end, it's going to be exactly what some players are looking for, and that's gonna be great for them.	</p></div>

			<p>Tales of series remasters will be released fairly consistently in the future, according to the series producer Yusuke Tomizawa.</p>
<p>Speaking during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs4h2yfF8D4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales of Series 30th Anniversary Project event</a>, the JRPG series producer talked about what's next for the series in terms of remasters, saying that Bandai Namco is planning to release remastered entries in the series fairly consistently in the future. He also added that a development line for the Remastered Project has been created to support this consistent release plan, so we should expect older entries in the series besides Tales of Graces f to become available on modern platforms in the future relatively quickly, which is great news considering how most entries in the series are stuck on previous generation consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="『テイルズ オブ』シリーズ 30周年プロジェクト スペシャル生配信" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fs4h2yfF8D4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The next month or so is going to be a great time for fans of the Tales of series. Before the aforementioned Tales of Graces f Remastered launches on PC and consoles next month, a dedicated team called Life Bottle Production will launch its English translation patch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch/">Tales of Rebirth</a>, one of the 2D entries in the series originally launched on PlayStation 2 which will unlikely ever be remastered. This translation patch will launch later today.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Tales of Arise, which launched back in 2021 on PC and consoles. The game is a solid addition to the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/festive-stellar-blade-update-brings-new-costumes-and-more-tomorrow.1062546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Shift Up has announced a holiday-themed&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing all kinds of festive goodies for you to enjoy, including new costumes, new decorations for certain areas, and more.</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>updates have brought things like a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, but this one's all about celebrating the holiday season, and the new costumes and content reflect that aim.</p>

<p>First up, Xion now sports its own Christmas tree, and The Last Gulp has been "decorated for the holidays". New seasonal music will play in the camp as well, contributing to a festive atmosphere and "melting away battle tension".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-holiday-update-festive-outfit.jpg?itok=jXGU0VJX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-holiday-update-festive-outfit.jpg?itok=I95xgi7y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s new holiday update brings new costumes and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>update without new costumes, and this one brings a festive Santa dress for Eve to wear, described by Shift Up as giving the game's protagonist an "adorable and festive appearance".</p>

<p>A new hairstyle, Santa Girl, has also been added, in addition to accessories like "Snow Crystal Glasses, Wreath Earrings, and Sleigh Ear Cuffs". Suffice it to say Shift Up's going all in with the holiday theming for this one.</p>

<p>It's not just Eve getting in on the festive fun, either. Adam also gets a new costume in the form of "I'm No Santa", which sees him riding atop the shoulders of a fake Santa. It's a cute costume idea, but perhaps not as cute (or horrifying) as your drone's Rudolph cosmetic.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can disable all of this festive fun and just play&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as it was originally intended, but where's the fun in being a grinch, eh?</p>

            <p>Sometimes dogs are hard to shut up. Over a year and half after releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hrot">Hrot</a> from early access, the developer of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>-inspired shooter has fixed the dogs after discovering that a few of the canines have been, for some players, barking in a hideous and endless loop. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A lot of people have complained about some barking," said developer Spytihněv in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/824600/announcements/detail/606394123884168300?snr=2___">an update post</a>. "There are some negative reviews about it, but I've always thought that it's just some people who don't like the dog barking while [firing guns]. Today I found out that on some PC configurations there was a looping unbearable barking." </p>
<p>Here is how one dog is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JXA7CvNZgY">meant to behave</a> in the game. And here is an example of the same dog, but <a href="https://x.com/DInexistente/status/1868377773313765755">infinitely barking</a>. You can shut the pup up for two seconds by feeding him until he vomits, but then he just starts yapping again. Then again, is this too not normal dog behaviour? Who can say. Judging by some of the Steam comments, it looks like this bug was affecting Linux-based systems.</p>
<p>"It's a shame that such a bug survived there for almost 2 years," said the developer, "levels with the ratters must have been awful, even downright unplayable, brrr."</p>
<p>I haven't played Hrot (to my shame, as a Quake-liker) but I do know that the "ratters" mentioned here refer to those same puppies that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAGPFrzehyE">hunt rats for you in this level</a>. They are very cute, but it wasn't the highlight of the game for Rick, who wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hrot-review">Hrot review</a>. He preferred the opening episode:</p>
<blockquote>"Here, the game's socialist parody and nuclear anxiety are in perfect sync. As you wander through Prague's abandoned streets, gymnasiums, and cultural centres, you'll encounter pictures of Czechoslovakia's first communist dictator Klement Gottwald, which you can kiss to show your allegiance to the nation. Later, you'll descend into some subterranean chamber lined with desiccated corpses, as that Geiger-counter crackle rises to an overwhelming crescendo."</blockquote>
<p>This makes it sound very high-brow. It is also a game in which you shoot a horse wearing a gas mask with a double-barrelled shotgun. It is a game where you fight a doppelganger of Putin riding a bear. Since finishing work on the shooter, the developer turned his sights to the strategy genre, releasing a retro RTS set on "a sandy planet with horses, tractors and techno music". It is called - let me check... ah, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2630920/Shrot/">Shrot</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On the series’ 20th anniversary, there are now dozens of sequels, upgrades, ports, and spin-offs that have introduced new creatures, iterated on the core boss fighting design, and expanded the lore in fascinating ways. To help explain what the franchise’s universe is all about, Capcom turned to none other than <em>Star Wars</em>’ Rey:</p><p>“Since ages long forgotten, one word has defined our very existence: balance,” Ridley says at the beginning of the brief history of <em>Monster Hunter</em>. “From the humble Felon to the ferocious Tigrex, every living being across this vast land plays its part in the great cycle, including us.” She explains why players spend all their time killing stuff in the game, as well as the hierarchy of beasts, from weak packs of Jaggi to all-powerful Elder Dragons. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>has always walked an uncomfortable line between the necessities of repetitive arcade action loops and the narrative repercussions of the ensuing carnage. “There is no thirst for violence, just an appreciation of life,” Ridley explains. More so than any previous entry in the series, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> seems intent on trying to convey the need for harmony, exploration, and curiosity as motivating virtues in its nevertheless brutal boss-slaying world. </p><p>The series’ first mainline entry built from the ground-up for the current generation of consoles, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 28 along with a slew of other big games in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/february-2025-too-many-games-assassins-creed-civ-7-ps5-1851657731?_gl=1*1q0b6l0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDM1NzkwMy4xMzUuMS4xNzM0MzYxOTc4LjQzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/february-2025-too-many-games-assassins-creed-civ-7-ps5-1851657731?_gl=1*1q0b6l0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDM1NzkwMy4xMzUuMS4xNzM0MzYxOTc4LjQzLjAuMA..">what’s already a super-packed month</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards were recently spotted on Zotac’s website.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, Zotac’s website featured listings for the upcoming, next-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These listings have been removed; however, there are still some hints that point towards an upcoming announcement. If you head to Zotac’s <a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/product/graphics_card/all?field_filter_g_memory_type_tid%5B%5D=2954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will observe new additions to its filters section. Players can filter the GPUs on the website by GDDR7 memory type and 32 GB capacity; these features are not available for the current RTX 40 series GPUs.</p>



<p>Five new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs surfaced on Zotac’s website, including RTX 5090, RTX 5090D (China Exclusive), RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The website didn’t feature the RTX 5060 and RTX 5080D GPUs. The listing also confirms 32 GB GDDR7 memory for the upcoming GPUs. With the graphics cards already surfacing on hardware manufacturer’s websites, it seems like Nvidia might be gearing up for an announcement soon. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-pc-game-of-2024.1062528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC is arguably the definitive gaming platform, deeper and broader than any of the bespoke boxes you stick under your TV. It has become a catch-all for multiplatform games, an inevitable second home for first-party console exclusives, and a bastion for smaller games that may not be able to develop ports. It’s also a destination of its own for unique, mouse-and-keyboard-driven genres that just aren’t quite as comfy to play while sitting on a couch, while also being the place for portable-friendly games thanks to the likes of the Steam Deck. Unsurprisingly, it meant we had a lot of games to pick from when it came to crowning our 2024 PC favourites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While plenty of incredible games came to both the PC and other platforms this year, our picks for the best PC games of 2024 stand as a mix of impressive experiences across multiple genres – some of which you simply can’t play with a controller in your hand. There’s the intricate, automated empires of Satisfactory; the exquisite puzzle design of Animal Well; the just-one-more-round compulsion of Balatro; the thrilling detective work of The Rise of the Golden Idol, and more besides.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But only one can be crowned the best PC game of 2024. What did the IGN team judge to be the most worthy? Let’s take a look at the results…</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With so many excellent games to choose from this year, the spread of votes for the best PC game was understandably broad. The varied taste of the IGN team meant that several games picked up a strong number of votes, but sadly not enough to secure a podium finish. Of those games, the two that only just missed out were 1000xResist and The Rise of the Golden Idol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty of games tell a compelling story, but it’s the way 1000xResist tells its story that truly stands out. It is a confident and moving tale that isn’t afraid to get deep, blending surreal concepts with emotionally charged deconstructions of the human condition in a manner reminiscent of games like Nier: Automata. Thanks to its narrative-first design being something of a first cousin to visual novels, 1000xResist’s story is able to double down on delivering ideas and plot in innovative ways that raise the bar for its genre. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/mixcollage-13-dec-2024-01-42-pm-1990-1734126162303.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rise of the Golden Idol and 1000xResist</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A follow-up to 2022’s breakout detective game, The Rise of the Golden Idol continues to impress by empowering you to solve its crimes with hands-on detective work. Set in the 1970s, it presents multiple diorama-like crime scenes in each chapter, demanding you to gather clues via close observation and then piece together exactly what happened. Rarely are the actual events as simple as they seem, and the truth can only be deduced from spotting minor things such as an empty gun chamber or the hidden subtext in an angry note. It’s a “puzzle” game that’s not simply about finding the right button to push, with an artistic presentation uniquely its own.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Animal Well</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/animalthumb-1716580525971.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Animal Well</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2D pixel art platformers can feel like they are a dime a dozen these days, but Animal Well is different. That may sound like a cliche setup, something you’ve heard before about plenty of other games, but it really is true here. Animal Well wears the skin of a puzzle-driven metroidvania while also twisting all the usual trends that come along with that structure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren’t fighting your way through waves of enemies or upping your missile capacity here, in part thanks to Animal Well’s almost complete rejection of violence. Instead you’ll find bubble-blowing wands that can produce floating platforms, frisbees that can tame ferocious dogs, and firecrackers that illuminate the dark to reveal the hidden platforming challenges ahead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real joy of Animal Well, though, is realising that there’s far, far more to each item than their obvious use. And then you begin to realise that there’s far, far more to each location than the obvious objectives. And as you begin to peel back the layers, you soon discover that what initially appeared to be a five-hour metroidvania is instead a gargantuan puzzle with enough secrets to discover that they could fill an actual well. It’s an innovative and endlessly enticing take on otherwise well-worn territory. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Satisfactory</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/satisfactoryversion1-0tlaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1725975211485.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Satisfactory</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After nearly five years in Early Access, Satisfactory’s 1.0 update arrived this year to cement it as one of the absolute best automation games around. It’s a game all about building assembly lines and laying down endless miles of conveyor belts, which is much more of an immense joy than it may initially seem. The subsequent tech climb that sees your factories become faster, more efficient, and inevitably more complicated always keeps you looking forward to that next big breakthrough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sight of spaghetti-like factories that span a thousand acres can seem intimidating at first, but don’t let that put you off: Satisfactory’s well-constructed web of objectives helps you build confidence in your engineering capabilities. Within just a few hours you’ll have graduated from novice conveyor belt enthusiast to an automation veteran, capable of troubleshooting catastrophic malfunctions as if they were minor inconveniences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the factories are your primary concern, Satisfactory is much more than the end result. This is also a Minecraft-style open world in which you must delve into caves, survive deadly gas clouds, and stripmine rock formations in order to gather the materials needed to both fund and fuel your colossal creations. Throw in a few friends working together in co-op to pave over every inch of green on this detailed alien world and you’ve got a recipe for “blink and an hour has passed” captivation that rarely quits. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: UFO 50</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/09/26/ufo-50---screen-3-1569520006711.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">UFO 50</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">UFO 50 is an almost incomprehensible achievement. The concept of an old-school gaming system being miraculously unearthed and made available today is a cute one already, and I wouldn’t blame you if you assumed the catalogue of 50 games that came with it were largely just quant minigames that make for an amusing but fleeting distraction. But that’s simply not the case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each and every entry in this library is essentially the size of an entire retro game of its own, many of which would have surely been standout hits in their era if they actually existed at that time. But this isn’t a collection of games made in the 1980s, and the deeper down the rabbit hole you go the more obvious that becomes. The games of UFO 50 are <em>smart.</em> Like, <em>modern day indie darling</em> <em>smart. </em>Each one weaves excellent new ideas into the canvass of a retro classic, resulting in games that feel like toys of yesteryear but play like a 2024 Steam top-seller. Echoes of No Man’s Sky, Hotline Miami, Into The Breach and more can be found between the scan lines, but each game is more than just a de-make of its inspiration. UFO 50 is essentially a playable examination of the past and present of video games.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s just so much to dig into here, with an almost alarmingly consistent level of quality. UFO 50 could have been half as big as it is and it still would have been impressive – instead, it’s borderline stunning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Winner: Balatro</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/balatrothumb-1725546218547.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Balatro</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve already played Balatro, you probably understand why it’s here. In fact, odds are good you might still be playing it right now. And if you haven’t, I’d recommend you do, but the kinder thing might be to tell you to run. Because once you’ve jumped into its smart mix of roguelite deckbuilding and digital poker, you might find your free time slipping away and the sun creeping up during what was supposed to still be night. But then again, it sure is worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something about Balatro that effortlessly hooks you, the “just one more turn” syndrome distilled into its purest form. Everything about its fairly simple presentation is tuned perfectly to be endlessly satisfying, bringing delight or destruction with every card you play. While on the surface it’s a poker game that’s approachable for anyone who can tell their flushes from their full houses, don’t be fooled into thinking you need to know the rules of the classic casino game to play. In fact, this isn’t <em>actually</em> poker. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Balatro is an entirely original idea, and while poker hands may be at the centre of the screen, the real centre of the experience is building wild game-breaking decks that can send your score multiplier skyrocketing. Each round allows you to tweak and improve your collection of cards, switching out suits to more easily achieve better hands, or using celestial powers to assemble literal wildcards. The options are unbelievably deep for those who then want to break the intuitive tropes open with smart modifiers – you may have put together a four-of-a-kind in your day, but play a five-of-a-kind for the first time and you won’t ever want to go back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the truly impressive trick of Balatro, making you think you know what it’s doing at every step of the way, then teasing you in deeper as more game-shifting Jokers are discovered, more decks are unlocked, and the scores you consider impressive start stretching from the thousands into exponents so large you need a degree to decipher them. Wrap that up in a lo-fi presentation as deceptively well designed as the card game it houses, and you’ve got a game we’re undoubtedly going to be playing for years to come. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of the four best decks in Pokémon TCG Pocket — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo ex, Pikachu ex, Charizard ex, and Starmie ex</a> — only one (Pikachu) doesn't rely on these additional mana generation cards. They're therefore very powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is one such card, as players can flip a coin until hitting tales, and add one energy to a single Pokémon for every heads. This obviously gives players a 50% chance of getting an additional energy, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">Misty became Pokémon TCG Pocket's most infamous cards for instances when players would get several heads in a row</a> and add five, six, seven, or more energy to a single Pokémon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/misty-1734356473654.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a soft limit to how useful this is, as most cards don't need more than three or four energy to use their most powerful attacks. but that's all about to change. A handful of cards including Stage 1 Pokémon Vaporeon were revealed in the Mythical Island trailer, and it's this card that could turn those several successful coin flip turns into practically an instant win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vaporeon has an Ability called Wash out, which lets players move around an unlimited number of water type energy between their Pokémon. This means the several energy created by successful Misty turns are no longer trapped on one Pokémon and can instead be spread around evenly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its most extreme, players on Turn 3, the opening player's first chance to attack, could therefore play a Misty and have a board with Starmie ex and two Articuno ex all capable of unleashing their strongest attacks; players would have, say, eight energy at their disposal instead of the two provided to most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This exact play will be the exception and not the rule, but it will almost certainly make those already annoyed by Misty even more frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vaporeon could still be an incredibly strong card outside of these major Misty moves too, as being able to move around energy freely offers myriad new solutions to old problems.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/screenshot-38-1734356696953.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If an Active Pokémon is near a knock out, for example, players could shift all its energy to another Pokémon so the replacement is immediately ready to fight next turn, or transfer energy the opposite way to allow it to retreat and not damage the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It therefore could be enough to bump the Starmie ex above the other meta leaders, though with more than 80 new cards coming to the game in Mythical Island, the entire player versus player scene could be due a mix up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Image quality issues, persistent performance wobbles, and challenges with the console's exclusive AI-upscaling technology, PSSR have all been noted. A <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new update for the survival-horror game</a> aims to fix most of these issues, some of which boil down to disabling PSSR entirely.</p><p>Alan Wake 2 is the first game to allow players to toggle PSSR on or off, with the game falling back to its previous implementation of AMD's FSR upscaling when disabled. In most instances, PSSR has been an improvement over FSR (which uses linear scaling as opposed to AI-enchanced upscaling), but Alan Wake 2 has been an outlier. In its analysis of the game on PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-alan-wake-2-how-does-ps5-pro-handle-one-of-the-best-looking-games-of-this-generation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> observed issues with image quality that FSR handled better. It did, however, note that PSSR was overall a better solution.</p>

<p>It's clear then that developer Remedy is giving players the option to decide for themselves, letting them omit one of the biggest features of the PS5 Pro entirely if they choose. Included in the patch is a new 40fps mode, too, which balances the image enhancements found in the PS5 Pro Quality mode and the fluidity of the Performance mode if you have a display that supports 120Hz.</p><p>Further adjustments to image settings have also been made to the Performance mode to stabilize the frame rate, while other tweaks the to game's ray-traced reflections should reduce their overall noisy presentation. The update also includes some smaller changes to DLC content, as well as minor fixes across all platforms. It's available to download now, with the full patch notes listed below.</p><h3>Improvements and additions</h3><ul><li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li></ul><h3>Fixes</h3><ul><li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li><li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li><li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series publisher Bandai Namco has revealed that it plans to release remastered versions of games in the series on a regular basis, and that a special development initiative has been set up to this end.</p>

<p>Speaking as part of a new 30th-anniversary broadcast (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/bandai-namco-to-release-remastered-tales-of-titles-fairly-consistently" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>),&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>titles will be released "fairly consistently", and that the studio "intends to continue" remastering&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games "as much as possible".</p>

<p>He then goes on to say that what he calls the "Remastered Project" now has a dedicated development initiative devoted to it, and that the team is hard at work on that project, although he didn't say which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is up for a remaster next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=uhSZKwAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=qITewjIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games are on the way, Bandai Namco says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomizawa's words come around a month before the newest&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, is set to launch. It's a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f</em>, which is itself a port of the 2009 Wii game&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces</em>, with the Wii version only ever being released in Japan.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series does not include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a>. It's confusing, I know, but Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games carry a specific action RPG formula that marries real-time combat with fairly typical JRPG dungeon and overworld exploration.</p>

<p>The most recent mainline&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game, and the series' 17th main entry overall, is 2021's&nbsp;<em>Tales of Arise</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-arise-has-sold-3-million-copies-before-releasing-on-game-pass-and-playstation" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up three million sales for itself</a> before being added to Microsoft and Sony's subscription services earlier this year.</p>

<p>Tomizawa has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tales-of-arise-interview-yusuke-tomizawa/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Arise&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game for first-timers, but he has also acknowledged the importance of making the RPG, which has a slightly more realistic visual sensibility than many of its predecessors, appeal to "everyone".</p>




<p>As for which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is next to get the remastering treatment, it's far too early to say.</p>

<p>Tomizawa and Bandai Namco are staying tight-lipped, and since&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered&nbsp;</em>still hasn't come out yet, it's likely that launch will take up a lot of the publisher's attention for the foreseeable future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

On average, it will take players anywhere between 50-100 hours to max out a class through various end-game activities, depending on your playstyle and any assistance you receive. That’s a lot of playtime if you’re intent on trying out everything on offer. Let’s go over which classes are the best options for new <em>Path of Exile 2</em> players. </p><figure id="" data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you should always play whatever class speaks to you the most, from a playstyle and preferences perspective, <strong>choose the Mercenary as your first class if you want to see everything <em>Path of Exile 2</em> offers</strong>. It’s one of the all-new classes designed for the ARPG sequel, and as such, developer Grinding Gear Games spent a lot of time refining its abilities, gems, and passive skills, making for an exceptionally strong playstyle.</p><p>The Mercenary primarily utilizes crossbows with various round-based attachments and unique grenades to deal damage. One of the first skills you’ll unlock as part of the game’s prologue is Fragmentation Rounds, which essentially turns your crossbow into a close-range shotgun loaded with Dragon’s Breath rounds. Every shot, while slow to fire and reload, unleashes a burst of fire that deals significant up-close damage to enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From there, you’ll gain access to the game’s skill panel to unlock additional abilities once you receive an Uncut Gem. There are a few choices for the Mercenary’s best starting skills, but there’s nothing wrong with experimenting. You’ll receive countless gems throughout your playthrough, allowing you to mix and match or outright remove and replace abilities depending on the zone or your preferences. You’re not locked into a single build!</p><p>One crucial aspect to consider when selecting a class in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is how it plays solo. Many people play the game alone, though the sequel allows up to six players to cooperate while clearing bosses and zones. After spending approximately 30 hours playing through the main storyline as a Mercenary, I can attest that, while weak against certain bosses, the class does exceptionally well for the most part. It keeps enemies at range with diverse abilities designed to reduce movement capabilities, AoE (area-of-effect) attacks that make clearing small mobs of standard enemies a breeze, and single-shot damage attacks designed for elite enemies, like bosses and named mobs.</p><figure id="" data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Furthermore, the ability to wear various armor types, from leather to plate, makes the Mercenary a stalwart choice. If you don’t mind moving slowly, becoming a mobile tank, then heavy armor locks down your defense. But if you want to keep moving, use run-and-gun tactics with the crossbow, wear light armor, and dodge-roll away from danger with relative ease.</p><p>There’s a lot to love about Path of Exile 2, from its classes to the many tough-as-nails boss fights you’ll encounter, but it appears there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522">loot problem the devs intend to solve</a></span>.

As a lifelong Shadow the Hedgehog stan, I’m glad to hear that. I rewatched the first two movies last week as a refresher, and that first one is actually a lot better than I remembered. These movies still have their problems, like an overreliance on pop culture references and too much of the human characters for my liking, but it sounds like the third movie is addressing some of those issues. We’ll have our full review on <em>Kotaku</em> when the film launches later this week.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elden Ring has sold over 28.6 million copies, reaching a significant milestone for the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-sells-over-28-6-million-copies">Elden Ring Sells Over 28.6 Million Copies</h2>



<p>Announced <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/jp/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241213_eldenring_nightreign_debut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently</a> by FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, Elden Ring has sold over 28.6 million copies globally. Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a> from Niko Partners, the Dark Souls series sold only 27 million units before Elden Ring was released in February 2022. Since then, however, the franchise has sold over <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/integrated/pdf/2023EN_fact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">35 million units</a>, and Elden Ring was one of the factors that helped amplify the sales of this series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One factor that helped Elden Ring hit this number was the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which was released in June 2024. Before its release, Elden Ring’s sales were at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-breaks-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25 million</a>; an additional 3.6 million units were sold in the last six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Elden Ring franchise already has plans to keep the sales going in 2025. Announced during the latest iteration of The Game Awards, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new co-op action-adventure game</a> called Elden Ring Nightreign. This co-op title will act as a spin-off rather than a sequel and will be released for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign will <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank">host</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a network test in February</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was rated 18+ by PEGI, the classification board in charge of game ratings across Europe. Developer LocalThunk has resurfaced frustration over the rating, joking in a series of tweets that it should add "real gambling" to lower its rating down to 3+, like the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-ref-id="5000-635887">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111242" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI's reasoning for the rating</a>, the board singles out the use of real-life poker hands in Balatro, stating that its inclusion could teach players its mechanics for use in real gambling. Despite poker just being the basis for Balatro's roguelite gameplay, PEGI says its prominent gambling imagery is deserving of its highest Adults Only rating. This rating isn't new either--earlier this year, it was the reason Balatro was suddenly pulled from several console storefronts, as its previous 3+ rating was changed overnight without prior notice.</p><p>LocalThunk hasn't let it go, citing a game that several European countries have previously deemed to have gambling elements. EA Sport FC 25 contains the same microtransactions and loot-box mechanics that have been in the series ever since Ultimate Team was first announced, but has maintained its 3+ "suitable for all ages" rating. LocalThunk points to this specifically as a double standard, even joking that Balatro should incorporate the same mechanics in order to get its rating lowered.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</p>  — localthunk (@LocalThunk) <a href="https://twitter.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>LocalThunk continued to say that the issue wasn't necessarily with Balatro's own rating, but that other more blatant examples of "gambling mechanics for children" should be similarly clamped down on. "The red logo looks kinda dope," concluded the developer.</p><p>Balatro's rating hasn't stopped its meteoric success since launch. The game has sold over 3.5 million copies, and won several awards at last week's The Game Awards show. The captivating roguelite is also one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/#3" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's top 10 games of 2024</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the previous film featured Shadow in a scene after the credits, setting up the story for this third film.</p>
<p>Many fans are therefore eagerly awaiting this film's equivalent scene to see who might be coming next. This is your warning, then, to mute any necessary keywords and watch out on social media.</p>

<p>The UK premiere for the film took place last week, alongside various early viewing screenings. As such, recorded footage has now found its way online - we won't link to it here.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will release worldwide on 20th December, so it's not long until the post credits scene has been widely viewed.</p> <div>

More than anything, though, there’s a letting go of illusions. The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can’t figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!”</p><p><em>Wukong</em>, which won both the Players’ Voice award and Best Action Game, might be considered rather successful at the awards. It was beaten to GOTY, however, by <em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony’s self-congratulatory and adorable third-person platform game, and faced some serious competition with the likes of <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> and <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> also nominated. And while Ji recognized that all these games are “exceptional,” this apparently did not stop reactions at the ceremony from being so strong that some sitting nearby say they saw Game Science developers crying when the game failed to win.</p><p>Ji’s Weibo post goes on to say that he was so confident of winning this trophy that he wrote his acceptance speech <em>two years ago</em>. He explains that he was more optimistic than some of his colleagues, and states that the game’s success commercially and with players was not a fluke, but rather “an inevitable outcome of Chinese culture.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/chinese-players-review-bomb-baldurs-gate-3-steam-black-myth-wukong-loses-goty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/chinese-players-review-bomb-baldurs-gate-3-steam-black-myth-wukong-loses-goty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MP1st</em> reports</a></span> that some Chinese fans took the loss no better. In a grim turn of events, furious <em>Wukong</em> stans decided to review-bomb <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, of all games, after Larian boss Swen Vincke’s wonderful three-minute introduction to the GOTY award. During this speech, Vincke took the opportunity to argue for an industry that looks after its developers rather than exploits them, and that makes games for art as well as profit, but this may have been misunderstood by a contingent of <em>Wukong</em>’s Chinese fans. <em>MP1st</em> claims it’s a result of a poor translation read by Chinese players, but doesn’t point to where this may have happened.</p><p>When someone has poured their life and soul into a project, it’s extremely understandable for them to become emotionally involved in the rewards and awards that follow. It’s also the case that award ceremonies are subjective popularity contests, in which wholly dissimilar things (like a 3D cartoon platform game about a robot and a tough-as-nails action game based on Chinese mythology) are artificially pitted against one another, with results based on the voting whims of a small group of individually partisan industry representatives. It must feel lovely to win, but it’s also entirely daft.</p><p>If your favorite game of 2024 was <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, then you need not craft a trophy out of tin foil, but instead just recognize that that’s enough entirely on its own, and doesn’t require the validation of a few strangers who got to vote in the Dorito man’s yearly shindig.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, a developer at Unpacking studio Witch Beam is calling out the latter title as one of many "egregious scams" on the Switch's online storefront.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Unpacking creative director Wren Brier took <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3ldfndqrhzk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to BlueSky</a> to challenge Nintendo to remove "cheap fakes" from the Switch's eShop. "It's been over two weeks and these are still on the eShop," Brier wrote. "Nintendo hasn't responded to any of our reports of these egregious scams which are using our trademarked game name and purposely tricking Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes."</p><p dir="ltr">Brier originally posted about the Unpacking clones on November 28 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3lbzzabxois2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on BlueSky</a>.

The game results did pull up the original Unpacking first, but right next to it is Unpacking: Deluxe Edition.

Other games available on the Switch eShop from the company include Cowboys vs Zombies: Deluxe Edition, Anime Puzzle Quest: Deluxe Edition, and Car Parking: Premium Edition.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Witch Beam has dealt with Unpacking clones, either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unpacking-creator-nintendo-eshop-copies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  
          
      
<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p><em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>developer Wren Brier has claimed that Nintendo isn't responding to her requests to take down blatant copies of the game that are still squatting on the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:en7lk6dayjekqei65vpfornn/post/3ldfndqrhzk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Brier points out that this issue was first raised <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3lbzzabxois2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around two weeks ago</a>, when a user by the name of Daniel Vuckovic described eShop listings like&nbsp;"<em>Unpacking: Deluxe Edition</em>" as "straight up copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Earlier today, though, in the new thread, Brier says that "it's been over two weeks" and that the listings, which also include the likes of "<em>Unpacking: Chill Music Pack</em>" and "<em>Unpacking: Haunting Locations</em>", still haven't been removed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unpacking-eshop-copies-bluesky-wren-brier.jpg?itok=AE_qLbMP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unpacking-eshop-copies-bluesky-wren-brier.jpg?itok=WHs-odEr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Things are pretty bad when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>knockoffs on the Switch. Screenshot courtesy of Wren Brier.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but Nintendo hasn't responded to any of Brier's reports of what she calls "these egregious scams", which she accuses of using&nbsp;<em>Unpacking</em>'s "trademarked game name" in order to "purposely [trick] Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes".</p>

<p>Disappointingly, this isn't the first time Brier and her team have run into spurious grifters trying to profit off their work. Back in 2022, a <a href="https://x.com/UnpackingALife/status/1485791817757245441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">similar issue arose</a> when a mobile&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>ripoff topped the charts on the iOS App Store (shortly before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-rip-off-pulled-from-app-stores-but-only-after-topping-charts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">being removed</a>, that is).</p>

<p>It's especially disheartening when considering that Nintendo is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hdh1jb/comment/m1weaho/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently more than happy</a> to enforce the kind of strict content regulations that lead to the&nbsp;<em>Neptunia&nbsp;</em>games' Western release being canceled on Switch, but not to deal with seemingly obvious cases of infringement like this.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>itself, if you haven't played it, it's a puzzle game that revolves around putting objects in their proper place across a series of rooms. As you play, you'll also uncover a narrative told through the kinds of objects you're, well, unpacking.</p>

<p>The game proved popular with players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unpacking-sales-move-across-million-mark" rel="nofollow">crossing the million-sale mark</a>&nbsp;in November 2022 and bagging itself a mobile release the following year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-pushed-china%E2%80%99s-gaming-industry-to-new-heights-in-2024.1062405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently reported that China has enjoyed a record-high year for revenue in the games industry. In new data, it was highlighted that numbers swelled by more than 7.5% in 2024, hitting highs of $44.8 <strong>billion</strong>. This makes the Chinese video games market the second-largest domestic market on the planet.</p>



<p>Most of the growth is being attributed to Black Myth: Wukong, which set staggering sales records this year and was regarded as China’s first AAA game. The mythical title was released in August 2024 and remains popular today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-boosted-figures">Boosted Figures</h2>



<p>While it’s not the largest year-on-year increase China has seen of late, the figures speak for themselves – China’s video games industry is <strong>soaring</strong>. In 2023, a post-COVID boom introduced 14% growth in revenue, and while this year’s increase rate has been slashed in half, the total value is much higher overall.</p>



<p>This news was reported by the ‘China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association’ in Beijing and was circulated <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3290626/chinas-video-gaming-revenue-hits-new-high-2024-back-blockbuster-releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SCMP.com</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Chinese organisation said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The scale of the domestic market has been steadily increasing, with new mobile titles and single-player titles making outstanding contributions. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>China is also enjoying a boom in mobile gaming, with the data showing that up to three-quarters of the overall revenue accrued through 2024 is attributed to mobile games. Black Myth: Wukong may have turned millions of heads both in China and overseas, but mobile games are still king in the country.</p>



<p>It was further reported that the number of active gamers in China also grew this year, and now more than 670 million individuals across the country are engaging in video games in some way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of a new patch for Alan Wake 2. Version 1.27 is mainly aimed at improving the PlayStation 5 Pro support for the survival horror game.</p>
<p>When the new console launched in November, Digital Foundry <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, which performs admirably in most games, wasn't a great fit for this one due to the low internal rendering resolution. A few days later, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would take a few weeks to improve the quality of the PS5 Pro version.</p>
<p>About a month later, this new patch adds several options and improvements to Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<ul>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch is also available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, which are getting the following minor fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li>
<li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Wake 2 launched on October 27, 2023 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a> and overall reception from fans. However, sales weren't equally amazing. To this day, after the release of the two planned story DLCs (Night Springs and The Lake House), the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> only 1.8 million units and still <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn't managed</a> to recoup all of the development and marketing costs.</p>
