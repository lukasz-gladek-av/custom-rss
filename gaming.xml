            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"This is the absolute worst generation."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being revealed at last year's The Game Awards, Naughty Dog's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> is reportedly still years away from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Uncharted and The Last of Us studio should also not expect another glimpse of the project at next month's annual video games award ceremony, it was claimed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion around when to expect Intergalactic was recently sparked by journalist Colin Moriarty, who suggested he thought it possible the game would launch in 2026. (After various sites picked up the comment as confirmation, Moriarty then <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> a clarification to say he'd just been "speculating," though by then, the topic had snowballed.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In March this year, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> with 28 Years Later director Alex Garland, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said the developer still had "a ways to go" on the project. During the same month, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier stated that the game would not launch in 2026 (and neither would The Witcher 4, either). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Schreier has now <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-on-intergalactic-can-assure-you-that-intergalactic-is-not-coming-out-in-2026.1361842/post-148016161" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a> this statement — once again placing Intergalactic's arrival as 2027 at the earliest, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-tech-wizard-mark-cerny-teases-new-graphics-features-hes-excited-to-bring-to-a-future-console-in-a-few-years-time-sparks-wave-of-ps6-release-date-speculation-in-the-process">potentially skipping the PS5 generation altogether</a>. Meanwhile, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that the game won't be making a second appearance in trailer form at The Game Awards this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this a surprise? Not really. PlayStation (and Nintendo, and Xbox) have a habit of teasing blockbuster titles a long time before they're ready for most people to play them. And in an interview in May, Druckmann confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-developer-naughty-dog-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-other-than-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-confirms">Naughty Dog was also working on a second game</a> which he said he was acting as "more of a producer" and "mentor" on. Perhaps this game will be announced and launched first?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the reminder that Naughty Dog's big new IP is still years away has come as a disappointment to some. Should Intergalactic launch in 2027, it will have been seven years since the launch of The Last of Us Part 2. During the PlayStation 3 and 4 era, Naughty Dog launched a trilogy of Uncharted games and the first The Last of Us within the same timeframe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Naughty Dog has still launched new products over the past few years, including the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered — but these have been re-releases and remasters. At the same time, it has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">abandoned its long-awaited multiplayer The Last of Us spin-off</a>, which will now no longer see the light of day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am all for letting devs cook but this is the absolute worst generation for Naughty Dog," one fan <a href="https://x.com/NeoGameSpark/status/1992617103627804904" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media. "TLOU P2 dropped in 2020 and all we've gotten are barebones remasters, an unnecessary remake, cancelled multiplayer and waiting almost a decade for a new game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Druckmann has spoken confidently that Intergalactic will be worth the wait. Featuring a dark sci-fi story centered around the topics of faith and religion, the project will be led by a star-studded cast that includes Tati Gabrielle from the Uncharted movie as protagonist Jordan A. Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September this year, in an interview in which Druckmann described development as "firing on all cyclinders," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-maybe-the-most-expensive-game-the-studio-has-ever-made">the director branded his next project as "the most ambitious game we’ve ever made."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's the most expansive game we've ever made," he then teased, "[and] maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160759/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Developers Purple Lamp Studios are single-handedly keeping the dream alive for the continuing adventures of everyone's favourite sentient sponge.</p>
<p>2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_battle_for_bikini_bottom_-_rehydrated">Battle for Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated</a> was a fine update to a cult classic and a huge success to boot. The studio followed up with a solid sequel in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">The Cosmic Shake</a>, making good on the promise to continue the franchise.</p>
<p>We now have another adventure from that same template with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">Titans of the Tide</a>, a familiar adventure that is fun for all ages and preserves the universal appeal of its source material.</p>
<p>The story is about as simple as an average episode of the show. King Neptune and the Flying Dutchman get into a seismic squabble in the Krusty Krab, and the denizens of Bikini Bottom end up caught in the crossfire. Undersea inhabitants are turned into slime-throwing spectres and Squidward has something else to complain about. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up to battle the Dutchman's army of monsters and save the day. How else is Mr Krabs going to turn a profit?</p>

<p>Although this title is not a huge leap from The Cosmic Shake, it is a clear step up from PHL Collective’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_patrick_star_game">The Patrick Star Game</a>. Where that title was more of a kiddy-friendly puzzler, this is an expansive collectathon platformer.</p>
<p>As a proud member of the multi-generational legion of SpongeBob fans, I always look forward to these. The presentation is flawless, Bikini Bottom and its inhabitants are lovingly rendered. Levels are full of NPCs, most of which have a quip to throw your way, and some have genuinely funny dialogue that’s worth discovering. It's fun to explore the levels (with the help of a handy surfboard), finding all the fish people tucked away in every corner.</p>
<p>Titans of the Tide lets you play as both SpongeBob and his dim starfish buddy. Through the magic of a BFF Ring, both characters are with you throughout the game. Each of them has a unique ability set that helps solve platforming and environmental puzzles across the levels.</p>

<p>You can swap between them with the push of a button, with the non-controlled character floating around as a ghost. This spectral companion acts as an objective guide and lights a path to the next goal within the generously sized environments.</p>
<p>Special abilities are fun to mix and match. SpongeBob utilise his karate experience, while Patrick can burrow underground and grapple with a spectral whip. Levels often encourage using this character-switching mechanic, and it is satisfying to swap between the two for traversal and combat.</p>
<p>Battling the spectral minions of the Flying Dutchman is a bit thin. You get simple melee combos and the occasional light environmental puzzle during boss encounters. Some enemies require the use of a newly discovered ability, although most encounters are little more than punch and move on.</p>

<p>Between quests, you'll head to the Floating Patty, a hub area where you can chat with NPCs and pick up side quests from the likes of Plankton and Sandy. There's a lot of content here, with a broad variety of locations and a ton of side content. Collecting everything doesn't have quite the same challenge as flagship 3D platformers, but what's here could easily fill a giant-sized Krabby Patty.</p>
<p>While not a graphical powerhouse, Titans of the Tide plays like a dream. Quality (30fps) and performance (60fps target) modes are both viable thanks to a motion smoothing slider. I always enjoy the stretchy animations and physics ripped straight out of the cartoon.</p>
<p>Audio is also great, with the cast of the show on hand to provide voice work; this alone will be worth the cost of admission for fans. It's worth noting that barely a second of gameplay goes by without a cheesy quip, dumb Patrick-ism, or signature laugh from Tom Kenny, so mileage may vary on your tolerance for that.</p>

<p>The only real gripe I have with Titans of the Tide is that it doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from the other two titles in Purple Lamp’s series revival. Aside from the ghostly enemies and ability switching mechanic, this game is no different from Battle for Bikini Bottom or Cosmic Shake. Even the in-game store, which contains a generous amount of skins for SpongeBob and Patrick, is basically the same as it was in the previous game. The format is reliable, but three games in and it's starting to creak.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are a fan of the other games in this cycle of platform adventures, you are going to love Titans of the Tide. It's another colourful, funny SpongeBob adventure from Purple Lamp and, just like the cartoon, repeat viewings don’t tend to lessen the magic. The formula is starting to show its age now, but it's still the best virtual Bikini Bottom we've got.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Xenopurge Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/24/xenopurge-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenopurge-review.1362682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Xenopurge may be one of the most tense auto-battler strategy games I have played, and that is in no small part to the influences it takes from Aliens. You are a commander on a remote and secure base, but your job is to issue commands to your squad on the ground as they infiltrate Xeno bases to kill aliens, rescue important people, and gather intelligence. Yet, apart from their portraits on the side of the screen, and hearing their voices through the radio, your squad are nothing more than small health bar and a designation number on your screen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenopurge -  1.0 Full Release trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RlQPZgpjE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Humanity is at war with aliens and you are a member of MACE, the human military machine that is trying to fight back. The information you have is limited even as a Commander, but Xenopurge has a story threading through your encounters with the aliens, making you question what is really going on.</p>


<p>The game is played from a first person perspective as you view multiple screens to set up and manage your run and your squad. Four different squads eventually become available to you, but you will start with the Sentinel Squad which is a classic brute force squad that start with health packs and other boosts that improve speed and attack power. As you make your way through the ranks you eventually unlock the Huntsman, Synthetic, and Bioweave squad types. The Huntsman are more tactical, using turrets and mines to keep the enemy at bay, but they do not start with any health packs. Synthetics are all androids who have no healing ability, so have to be repaired between missions, but they can hack things like doors to stop enemies from getting through them for a time. The Bioweave are the weakest class to start off with, but each kill awards biomass which allows Bioweave units to upgrade themselves to become stronger.</p>


<p>Whichever squad you choose, you will only have limited input on their actions when on missions. Starting commands include prompting them to us a health stim, set up a turret, bioweave to create armour, or hack doors, though these depend on which squad you are using. As you progress through a run you may unlock new commands to use, hopefully selecting the most useful ones that complement your squad. Runs themselves consist of missions and stops at gear or upgrade points, where you can improve melee damage, get new weapons, upgrade soldier logic, or hire another soldier, boosting your squad size up to the maximum of four. Xenopurge is pretty generous with its rewards for successful missions, so you can always get some better gear, but not all of it in one hit.</p>
<p>All of this is viewed on a basic monitor in-game, where little green health bars engage with red health bars. You cannot direct where your squad will go, unless you get the ‘go to room’ command, and have to watch as they make their own decisions on how to proceed unless you give them a specific job to do, like collect a package. This is where some of that tension comes in for Xenopurge. For example, when one squad member is backed into a corner as enemies converge on them there is no way to get your other soldiers to run to their aid unless they are going in that direction themselves. The music really adds to the atmosphere, especially as the countdown gets closer to zero to triggering the next wave. Watching doors open on the screen where you have no line of sight is also tense, because you do not know what kind of enemy is coming for you. And hearing your soldiers shouting for help is another thing that really sells the immersion of being a commander who is helpless at times.</p>
<p>One issue I had with the AI was when ordering soldiers to extract, as they would just try and run past enemies or ignore fights that another soldier was engaged in, unless they get attacked themselves. I would imagine in real life, soldiers would still engage with enemies as they head to extraction points and help fellow squad mates. Another was that when all the rooms have been uncovered and most objectives cleared, units will stay in place even if they can hear another soldier shouting for backup. As I do not have the command to send soldiers to help their comrade, I would have hoped hearing it over the radio would spur them into action.</p>

<p>Despite those annoyances, Xenopurge has hooked me. There are a lot of run variations you can take on, with an achievement for completing each one, and squads can be altered with variants that give unique soldiers, such as one named Ripley who has a motion scanner. There are different zones across Xenopurge to explore with the later zones providing a much more difficult challenge due to being deep in Xeno space. Outside of the monitor, your commander can leave their seat and explore the cabin to read emails and watch news reports to learn of what is really happening. Here, the development team leave clues that something isn’t right and as you explore your little cabin and eventually what is beyond the door you too question the realities of the war.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nearly a month after the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, former Creative Director and The Chinese Room Studio Head Dan Pinchbeck opened up on the game's development phase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWDyNLAo1E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with YouTuber Cat Burton</a>. </p>



<p>The most interesting tidbit is that Pinchbeck really didn't want to call this game Bloodlines 2. As you might recall, The Chinese Room only came in to rescue the game from cancellation after publisher Paradox Interactive split with the original developer of the sequel, Hardsuit Labs. That also meant they didn't have enough time or money to make it the true sequel fans of the original might have wanted. Apparently, it was Pinchbeck who decided to make it a more focused, Dishonored-like game, due to the constraints the developers were forced to work with.</p>



<p><em>We used to sit there and go and have these planning sessions of how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2. That feels like the most important thing we do here, is to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. You can't make Bloodlines 2. There's not enough time. There's not enough money. Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting. A lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you actually broke them apart and analyzed them. Great ideas, wonderful ideas, players loved them. You couldn't get away with it now.</em></p>



<p><em>So, trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrongheaded. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make people who love Bloodlines 1 happy and you wouldn't make people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2 and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money.</em></p>



<p><em>So we approached it from that point of view of, well, what can we do with the time and the money that's available, and at that point, I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make Skyrim, but we can make Dishonored.' We would look at something which is not an RPG and is not fully open world, but is really tightly focused and true to the mythos, and it's a good ride, we get a Bloodlines title out in the world, and then we'd started talking about saying, then what would the next big Bloodlines game look like after that, if that happened?</em></p>



<p>It's a sound strategy, in theory. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the game is going to sell enough to warrant a bigger, better sequel. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, only between 120K and 300K copies of the game have been sold so far via PC's most popular store. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I concluded that Bloodlines 2 is worth playing despite its flaws, but only for fans of the setting and once the game is significantly cheaper than the launch price. However, that might happen very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s most popular console has officially gone retro. Let’s remember what made it great.</p> <p>The Xbox 360 came out a year earlier than the competition and $100 cheaper than the base PlayStation 3. It seemed to make all the right moves, using <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> to jump start online multiplayer into the soon-to-be dominant form of gaming, while investing it all back into indie curation, big exclusives, and marketing deal that made the console feel like the place everyone had to be.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Jul 30, 2024. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In some ways it felt like the best of all worlds, and by the end of the generation you could pick up an Xbox 360 for just $100 and play dozens of the best games ever made. The culture was far from healthy, and some of the places making everything were a mess to work for. But it was also a fun time, and a weird one. Here’s what we’ll miss about it and why the Xbox 360 still feels so special to us.</p>

 <hr> <p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842">Let’s remember some Xbox 360s</a>! What’s your Xbox 360 origin story Carolyn?</p> <p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> The first E3 I ever attended was in 2005, with the Xbox 360’s launch still some months out and I have to say, the games I saw on the show floor looked amazing. It’s hilarious to me now considering I haven’t even thought about this game in probably 15 years, but at that time, the game that blew me away the most was probably <em>GRAW</em>. Interestingly, though, despite my initial excitement about the console being rooted in its graphical power and my lust for next-gen spectacle, now, when I think back on what made the console so special to me, it’s not really about that aspect of it at all. What about you Alyssa?</p>

 <p><strong>Alyssa Mercante:</strong> I’ve told mine on<em> Kotaku</em> more than once, but I had borrowed my high school sweetheart’s original Xbox to play <em>Halo 2</em> when he went away to college, but not long after that <em>Halo 3</em> came out, which wasn’t backwards compatible. So I went out during my free period in high school (we had an open campus for seniors, you could take your car and leave if you didn’t have class), and drove to a Target where I spent my summer job savings on a 360, <em>Halo 3</em>, and Xbox Live.</p>

 <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I have zero recollection of the Xbox 360’s launch. What was I even doing at the time? 2005. Hmm. I was going into my senior year in high school, barely playing anything except for the occasional late-stage PS2 game—<em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</em>, followed eventually by <em>Okami </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>. My only real memory of the beginning of that console cycle is my brother getting a PS3 and me having almost no interest in it. It wasn’t until my girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend in college got me hooked on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> that I finally picked up a super cheap used Xbox 360 arcade edition for like $150. That four years after the console launched but still somehow only the mid-way point.</p>

  <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Yeah, I don’t remember exactly when I finally got one myself—I certainly couldn’t afford one at launch, and my memories of the time around release have a lot to do with playing Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie (lol) at GameStop kiosks.</p>

 <p><strong>Moises Taveras: </strong>The first time I ever played an Xbox 360 also had to do with <em>Call of Duty: MW2</em>. It was all the rage with the kids in my middle school, but I was largely looking from the outside in as a) a PlayStation kid since my youth and b) someone who came from a family too poor to afford more than one console. But eventually, I made friends who had 360s and I remember us all cramming onto a couch in the smallest bedroom imaginable at our friend Howard’s house and playing local multiplayer matches till we lost our voices from shouting. I learned really quickly then that the 360 was synonymous with multiplayer and socializing with folks and it made me want one so bad. Little did I know I wouldn’t get a 360 till the very end of the console generation!</p>

 <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I think part of the Xbox 360’s dominance in that era can be attributed to the fact that it offered the best online experience for folks wanting to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, but it also did something incredible that totally won over people like me. I’m not saying I didn’t have an amazing time playing Gears of War co-op, I absolutely did, and huge credit to Microsoft for putting out a steady stream of banger exclusives that really made Xbox Live feel essential. But for me, when I think about the Xbox 360, what still gets me excited most is Xbox Live Arcade, and particularly amazing games like <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em>. Games like this took the arcade leaderboard competition of my childhood and absolutely exploded it. Suddenly I was staying up nights pouring everything I had into beating my friends’ high scores on online leaderboards for all the world to see. Man, it was incredible.</p> <p><strong>Moises:</strong> Supergiant Games’ Bastion absolutely blew my mind as far as what I thought games could be. It being a console exclusive to the 360 through XBLA broke my heart and kept me from the portfolio of what’d become my favorite studio, and then Xbox just kept pumping out indie titles like it. Honestly, my working definition of an indie game was largely informed by this era of XBLA games.</p>  <p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> The Xbox 360 was the first console launch I was really tuned into the industry for. I was full-blown sicko mode for that thing as a kid, and was counting down the days. I was a huge Rare fan at the time and Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero were a huge deal to me. But broadly, I think I fell off video games for a bit because the system just didn’t speak to my tendencies. As Moises said, the 360 became the multiplayer system and I preferred gaming in solitude, and eventually pivoted to the PS3 in the final years of that generation. But I played the <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy on the 360, so I ended up keeping an old 360 in my home longer than any other system. I had to replace the household 360 more times than probably any other system my family owned.</p>

 <p>We got a launch window system that died by the time <em>Halo 3 </em>came out, so we had to replace it swiftly. Then I got my own 360 for Christmas 2009, just before the launch of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. That sucker lasted over a decade. It gathered dust for large swaths of the time, but since I didn’t own an Xbox One, it was the only way for me to go back to my old <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy saves until the Legendary Edition came out in 2021. So while I had mostly abandoned the system by the end of the generation, the 360 is still a defining system in my life because it gave me one of the most important video game experiences of my life. I’ll always be grateful for it, even if I think the Microsoft was a trailblazer for some of the industry’s worst modern tendencies with it.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>That was the other thing that I think tipped me in the direction of the Xbox 360 besides the price and walled multiplayer gardens. As someone coming from the PS1 and PS2, it just had more of the RPGs I was craving earlier or in better condition. I came to the original Mass Effect late but it blew my mind. I got to catch up on Star Wars: The Old Republic. It was synonymous with retro and couch-coop indie games for me like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy. It really did just nail a lot of the same things that the PS4 did a generation later and which ultimately helped Sony to reverse the tide.</p>

 <p><strong>Moises: </strong>it’s so weird to think about now given Xbox’s current situation and catalog, but the 360 was where all the games were!</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Another thing that was a big factor for me, I have to admit, is that I was totally cheevo-pilled. The Xbox 360 brought about the advent of achievements and I got extremely excited about pulling off absurd things like beating Call of Duty campaigns on Veteran to get all the achievements. I no longer put much stock in achievements or trophies, but to this day I greatly prefer the at-a-glance number that reflects your achievements compared to all the trophies of PlayStation’s system. And on top of that, the whole interface on Xbox just felt so much more inviting to me than that on Sony. I think avatars were really smart of them to introduce in that era. I loved signing on and seeing little cartoon versions of all my good friends online, playing games of their own. In comparison to that, the whole interface of the PS3 just felt cold and impersonal to me, and that console would end up gathering dust in my entertainment center.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>The Xbox 360 home screen definitely felt a lot more inviting and hit that sweet spot of clutter to chill. The controller was also very solid. Have any of you gone back and tried to hold a PS3 DualShock? It feels like you’re being pranked. I take it none of you ever had an issue with red-ringing or other hardware failures?</p>

  <p><strong>Moises:</strong> Nope! Correct me if I’m wrong but those issues got ironed out with later iterations of the console, so by the time one of my best friends let me indefinitely borrow his 360, it was smooth sailing for me.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I did have to send mine back for repairs once, and for a while there at least, it felt like everyone I knew who owned one was hitting the red ring. There was a period there, at least in my circle of friends, where there was real disbelief and anger that Microsoft had sold us all a product that was so prone to failure. I think it speaks to just how fond people were overall of the console—its library, its interface, its online features—that today, when you bring it up, you’re far more likely to get fond recollections than bitter complaints. It was so good that even the considerable irritations so many of us experienced with it are now just a footnote in our memories.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>My console ended up red-ringing in like, 2012? But then I read that you can just put it in the oven and bake it at a low temperature to loosen up the glue. Has worked like a charm ever since.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Wow, I never knew that!</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I think one of the reasons people look back so fondly on the Xbox 360 is that, in retrospect, it felt like the last time you could contain the entirety of what was going on, coming out, and being talked about in your head at any given time. It was still very intimate and physical, with midnight launches and stacks of controllers in the split-screen coop session. There was spectacle with E3 but also the feeling you alone were discovering these incredible hidden treasures on Xbox Live Arcade, which was like a return to finding the internet for the first time again.</p>

 <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> I agree. And they just had so many games that became sensations for a time, from <em>Braid</em> to <em>Geometry Wars</em>. The curation was exceptional, and it was an era in which it still felt like the whole culture, or much of it at least, could still come together for a few weeks around some exciting new downloadable game.</p> <p><strong>Moises: </strong>Yeah. By comparison, when the PS4 really started to pivot to those smaller more intimate games early in its lifetime, it wasn’t that those games were lesser, but it did feel like they were being more haphazardly thrown on the platform to fill gaps between big exclusives. Meanwhile XBLA had these clearly thought out rollouts and events that made a big deal of Arcade titles. Also everything was less shitty. Xbox Live Gold was the original multiplayer subscription, and the only one for quite some time, but it at least seemed to provide value with great deals and a platform that produced rock solid multiplayer hits. It also wasn’t as expensive as anything is nowadays.</p>

  <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Before we wrap things up here, I think we can’t talk about what an amazing console the 360 was without saying a little more about its games. Are there any games y’all want to shout out as particular favorites that really helped make that library great or were emblematic of what the console was doing? When I think about the 360, I think about how the grittiness of <em>Gears of War</em> coexisted harmoniously alongside the whimsy of <em>Viva Pinata</em>, and I’ll never forget the dozens of hours my friends and I spent driving around doing challenges together in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>. It really did feel, more than a lot of other consoles, like it offered something for everyone, and like the people behind it thought deeply about how to bring people together to share in the experiences it offered.</p> <p>And even though some of its games were also on PlayStation, at least everyone in my friend group, won over by the cheevos and online features of Xbox, always bought multiplatform games there, which perpetuated the console’s dominance in that generation. It’s a little wild to think how this generation it feels somewhat the opposite for me, like most people I know play most multiplatform games on PlayStation. Wild how the tables have turned. But yeah, any other 360 shoutouts?</p>

 <p><strong>Moises: </strong>I cannot separate the 360 from the stunning role it did in promoting so many smaller studios to the mainstream. I already invoked Bastion from Supergiant Games, but I can’t not shoutout Limbo and Playdead, which has now delivered two absolutely singular game experiences in a row. Oh and Shadow Complex does still own.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Limbo </em>was incredible. While the indie darling backlash was fair and warranted, it was really an incredible run of curation there for several years. <em>The Dishwasher</em> games were great, and really spoke to that sense of Newgrounds 2.0 animating the grungy vibe of XBLA. It’s also wild how much Microsoft tried to court Japanese RPG fans with<em> Blue Dragon</em> and<em> Lost Odyssey</em>. For me personally, <em>Dungeon Defenders</em> is still an all-time great. One of the last times I was able to rope friends into playing something for hours with me on a couch.</p> <p>I was trying to think of my top five favorite 360 games, exclusive or no, and couldn’t stop listing stuff. The end of that console generation was so strong, on both 360 and PS3, maybe there’s hope that the Series X/S and PS5 pick up in their final years. But with massive budgets, long development times, and so much risk-averse consolidation, I’m not hopeful.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Whether it picks up to some degree or not, I think it’s safe to say that there will never be an era quite like that exemplified by the 360 again. The console was just perfectly poised to take advantage of a given moment in gaming culture and technology, employing exciting new ideas like achievements to build a sense of both community and friendly competition around games in ways that its library and online service leveraged brilliantly. Also, Sneak King was great.</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Any parting thoughts since you vanished, Alyssa?</p> <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> LMAO. The time my 360 red ringed right before I went up for senior year of college. The day before. And I went out and bought another because not having one wasn’t an option. That or the time my mother heard me cursing out misogynists in Italian?</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Was it on the $3 phone bank operator Xbox 360 headset?</p> <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Beninteso!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3S is literally the best value proposition in VR headsets at the moment. It’s an entry-level model capable of delivering performance very close to the premium Quest 3 which sells for $599. For the vast majority of buyers, this will be the smart choice.</p>
<p>Now the 128GB version has dropped to an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">all-time record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday at $249, down from $299</a>. The numbers say a lot about demand: over <strong>30,000 units sold in just a few days</strong>. This is the best-selling VR headset in its category right now and the popularity speaks well of the exceptional performance-to-price ratio that Meta managed to achieve with this model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wireless Freedom</h2>
<p>The <strong>completely wireless design eliminates the cables and external sensors</strong> that plagued earlier VR generations. You move naturally through virtual spaces without tripping over cords or worrying about connection points. Room-scale VR experiences feel liberating once you can spin, duck, and explore without physical tethers. Inside-out tracking uses built-in cameras rather than requiring external base stations. Set up takes minutes instead of hours, and you can play anywhere with enough clear space.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor brings <strong>double the graphical processing power of the previous Quests</strong>. Games load faster, graphics render with more detail, and frame rates stay smooth during intense action. This leap in processing power enables the creation of more complex virtual environments with better lighting, textures, and physics simulation. Developers can be more ambitious when constructing an experience because they know the hardware can sustain it.</p>



<p>The 8GB of RAM represents a 33% memory increase that directly impacts performance: The more RAM, the more the headset can juggle several background processes without bogging down active gameplay. Apps switch faster, menus load quicker, and the overall experience just feels more responsive. Games can load larger levels and handle more simultaneous objects without stuttering.</p>
<p>Dual RGB color cameras power a full-color Passthrough feature that will seamlessly blend the real and virtual worlds together. You can see your actual room in color while interacting with virtual objects overlaid in your space.<strong> Mixed reality apps let you place digital furniture in your home</strong> to preview before buying. Fitness apps show you your real environment while adding virtual trainers and UI elements. The quality of Passthrough is on par with what you’d see when looking through a pair of sunglasses, making it very practical for extended use.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life exceeds two hours on a single charge</strong> and covers most gaming sessions quite comfortably. Improved power management also extends playtime compared to earlier Quest models. Quick charging gets you back into action a lot faster once the battery runs low. External battery packs that are compatible with USB-C can extend sessions indefinitely, if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Instant access to 40+ games as part of the 3-month tria</strong>l removes any barrier to software purchases out of the gate. Popular titles from a multitude of genres give you plenty to explore while you discover what VR experiences you enjoy most. The ever-growing games catalog adds new releases monthly, so fresh content will surface regularly.</p>
<p>The exclusive<strong> Gorilla Tag bundle adds a selection of in-game items and currency</strong> that fans of the popular multiplayer game will appreciate. This social VR title has gained phenomenal traction, and the exclusive content sweetens things for existing fans or curious newbies alike. The 1000 shiny rocks provide immediate in-game purchasing power.</p>
<p>At $249, the Meta Quest 3S 128GB is offering flagship VR performance at an entry-level price this Black Friday. This headset sits just $50 above the old Quest 2 while offering dramatically better specs that approach the $599 Quest 3.</p>

<p>Every new update on Stellar Blade seems to suggest that the game has defied all expectations. Now, it’s understood that Stellar Blade has beaten out Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man, and others to be the best-selling PlayStation exclusive on PC.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade news has been coming thick and fast recently. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">Stellar Blade sequel is confirmed to be in development</a>, and the bombshell was dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade is going multiplatform</a>. The original game was a success on launch and continues to escalate in terms of popularity and sales.</p>



<p>Shift Up has revealed a new graphic showing this to be the case.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up showed off an impressive chart showing the biggest PlayStation-exclusive games that have received a PC port.</p>



<p>The graphic (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>) shows the top six games for sales on PC. The data shows Stellar Blade hit a peak of 192,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, with the next best being 77,000 players for Ghost of Tsushima.</p>







<p>The headline sentence also says: “Best-selling PlayStation-exclusive launch IP in history.”</p>



<p>Based on the numbers, this isn’t just the case; it’s conclusive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games has announced that PIONER, an ambitious post-apocalyptic MMO, will launch in early access on December 16, 2025. This date comes mere weeks after a successful beta test, which saw the game skyrocket to over 500,000 wishlists on Steam. The PC-exclusive MMO has been described as a perfect balance between the likes of Fallout, STALKER, and Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>PIONER features a massive open-world environment, stacks of customization options, and an immersive atmosphere that encourages players to prioritize exploration and development over anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-hits-early-access-soon">PIONER Hits Early Access Soon</h2>



<p>PIONER, which has been compiled by GFA Games, a studio headquartered in Serbia, is set to be released <strong>in early access </strong>on December 16. This news dropped today, along with a new trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER - Together" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZDY7I4VS70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<li>Exclusive Founder Title – a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency – 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” – cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch – inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s blurb reveals how much potential this game has:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PIONER takes players to a vast, atmospheric post-apocalyptic island, where remnants of the Soviet era create an incredible alternate reality. The game emphasizes realism over traditional mechanics, offering an open world of over 50 km2 filled with hidden dungeons, story quests, and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards. As a social-focused MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Players shape the world through their actions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PIONER has an expansive campaign that eases players in with a great tutorial section, and it has grown over several years of development to become something that could stun in early access.</p>

            <p>Valve has addressed the pricing for its recently announced hybrid PC, the Steam Machine.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Valve revealed its new gaming hardware, including the Steam Machine, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">console/PC hybrid which will be able to run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer</a>. But, while we have seen what the gear looks like, Valve refrained from offering any guidance on its pricing.</p>
<p>Valve's Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais have now addressed this question. Neither have disclosed an exact figure, but they have said the Steam Machine will be "more in line with what you might expect from [the] current PC market".</p>

<p>The Valve duo were guests on the Friends Per Second podcast when the topic came up. "I think that if you build a PC from parts, and get to the same level of performance, that's the general price window we aim to be at, " Griffais said.</p>
<p>"Ideally, we would be pretty competitive with that, and have a pretty good deal," he continued, adding Valve was "working on refining" the pricing.</p>
<p>When further asked if the Steam Machine was "going to be a subsidised device", the Valve developer said its "more in line with what you might expect from [the] current PC market", again saying the team wants to ensure it is a good deal for consumers in relation to its performance. "You know, you have features which are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts," Griffais further explained. "Obviously the small form factor and I think the noise level that we achieved (or lack thereof) is really impressive. We're excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is.</p><p>"But also, some integration features like HDMI CC, being able to turn on your TV, turn off your TV… that's all hard to do, but more importantly you can turn on the machine from your controller, which is not something that's straightforward depending on the kind of PC you have… so, being able to sit down on your couch, press one button on your controller and the whole thing lights up like you would expect for a thing that's in your living room, I think that's very valuable.</p>
<p>"There's not really a price point to that, because it's not something that exists in the PC market right now."</p>
<p>Closing, Griffais said there will be those among us who are perfectly happy to build a PC from scratch themselves. However, Valve's Steam Machine will be a "nice baseline offering", letting users access "some features which are really hard to get to otherwise".</p>
<p>In the same conversation, Griffais added Valve may be open to develop a 'Steam Machine Pro' down the line, but "for now" it is staying focused on the Steam Machine's current level of spec, as it offers "a good trade-off between affordability and the level of power" it provides.</p>

<p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-it-be-easy-to-buy-a-steam-machine-valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-hardware-launches">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile earlier this month, head of market analysis at video game industry analysis company Alinea Analytics Rhyss Elliott told our Connor that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400-with-a-controller-this-would-really-send-a-message-one-analyst-on-how-valves-steam-machine-could-make-the-biggest-impact-on-the-games-industry">price point will be a real indicator of how the Steam Machine is perceived in the market</a>. "If the Steam Machine launches above $500, it risks being perceived as an expensive niche PC (like the rumoured next-generation Xbox) rather than an accessible living-room gaming option," Elliott said.</p>
<p>"The sweet spot would be $400 with a controller. This would really send a message, as console manufacturers have been raising their prices."</p>

            <p>Celebrated indie gem Blue Prince won't be getting a localisation or a direct sequel, as its creator wants all his projects "to be able to stand up on their own and be unique things".</p>
<p>At present, the game is only available in English, with no in-game language options. Yet while some players have criticised the game for this as it's virtually unplayable for non-English speakers, its developer has no plans for localisation.</p>
<p>Blue Prince developer Tonda Ros told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/blue-prince-goty-localization-sequel/">Polygon</a> there are "certainly no concrete plans because it is largely considered near impossible".</p>

</figure>
<p>The reason for that is because so many of the game's puzzles rely on wordplay, which cannot be easily translated.</p>
<p>That's not to say it isn't necessarily doable, mind you, but that it would take far too long to achieve.</p>
<p>"It's a tough decision to let Blue Prince be discoverable by more people, but potentially risk burning out myself and/or giving up making a whole other game," said Ros.</p>
<p>That sort of work would equate to "creating a second game," he added. Yet a direct sequel isn't planned either, though a follow-up of sorts could still happen.</p>
<p>"I want all my projects to be able to stand up on their own and be unique things," said Ros. "That's just the type of sequels that I like. I like Myst followed by Riven, not Myst 2."</p>
<p>As such, there "will not be a direct sequel to Blue Prince," added Ros. "There might be a game set in that universe, but I can't even say it likely will be in the same genre."</p>
<p>At the very least, though, "it would take as many risks as Blue Prince took."</p>
<p>"More than anything, Blue Prince seems aware of the time you're spending within it, and that's pure magic to me," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">Eurogamer review of Blue Prince</a>.</p>
<p>"The richest aspect of the game's extremely rich design may be how many secrets it springs once you’ve lived with it for a while. It's the pleasure of finding hidden aspects to things you thought you understood in full, the pleasure of coming back to something you thought was simple and finding that it's not simple at all."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-not-like-baldurs-gate-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-iv-and-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-won%E2%80%99t-be-anything-like-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3.1362637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although it has provided some inspiration to The Witcher IV developer CD Projekt Red, future games from the studio won't be anything like Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-is-an-inspiration-for-cd-projekt-but-its-all-in-on-big-open-worlds-we-are-definitely-not-going-to-make-a-game-like-larian-did/">PC Gamer</a>, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski confirmed that Baldur's Gate 3 provided the developer a lot of inspiration, but they will still stick to the open-world setting seen in games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. Obviously, CD Projekt Red isn't going to simply create similar games with better graphics, as Nowakowski highlighted that the studio wants to <em>"innovate."</em></p>



<p>Although the CD Projekt's joint CEO did not elaborate on how they plan to innovate their open-world formula in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, it seems that world interactivity will be enhanced over older games.</p>



<p><em>"That's the kind of game they can make,"</em> Michał Nowakowski said about Larian Studios' games like the Divinity: Original Sin series and Baldur's Gate 3. <em>"But a lot of stuff with how they can interact with the world and what it does was, for sure, some inspiration to us."</em></p>



<p>Much of Baldur's Gate 3's success resides, in my opinion, exactly in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">how the world feels incredibly dynamic and reactive</a>, so it's great to hear that The Witcher IV may take the best of Larian Studio's approach for the third entry in the beloved series and apply it to its open-world formula to improve the experience. As good as The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are, their open worlds adhere to traditional by-the-books design without shaking them up significantly, so I am very interested to see how much this influence will shape their sequels.</p>



<p>One thing The Witcher IV is not going to feature for certain is new contributions from Andrzej Sapkowski, author of the novels upon which the CDPR series is based. According to the author, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-have-any-new-contribution-from-andrzej-sapkowski/">the developer rarely asks him for details nowadays</a>, but their relationship remains healthy after <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/">the signing of a new deal in December 2019.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-drops-airpods-pro-3-to-a-record-low-for-the-first-time-margin-clearly-isn%E2%80%99t-a-priority-this-black-friday.1362634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Apple drops a new tech device to replace a top-rated favorite — say, the AirPods Pro 2 — the first questions are always “how much better can the new one be?” and “do I really need to upgrade?” In the case of the AirPods Pro 3, the answers are “a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>” and “yes, absolutely.” The AirPods Pro 3 aren’t just Apple’s best active noise-cancelling in-ear buds, they’re the best ones made by anyone, anywhere, at any time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">They’re also on sale for the very first time at Amazon for Black Friday, with an all-time low price of $220.</a></p>
<p>There’s definitely nothing wrong with the AirPods Pro 2. They’re still among the very best wireless earbuds on the market (and almost certainly the subject of some epic Black Friday deals of their own, especially now that the Pro 3s have arrived). But the Pro 3s are on a whole new level, from their sound and noise cancellation to their redesigned feel — more contoured, shorter stems, and a better overall fit. As much as we love the Pro 2s and didn’t think we’d be recommending an upgrade this soon, here we are.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Turns Phenomenal</h2>
<p>As long as the list of serious perks is for the AirPods Pro 3, we have to start with the active noise cancellation. It takes the formidable ANC of the Pro 2s and doubles it, creating the world’s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And now with as much of the outside world blocked out as you want, you can immerse yourself in the upgraded sound of the Pro 3s. Apple’s added a new acoustic architecture that really brings out the bass, but also the mids, vocals, and every facet of the music.</p>
<p>It’s also an improved Spatial Audio sound, which will have you turning your head to move the sound source over and over until you get used to just how realistic the effect is. And you can move your head or any other part of your body as much as you like with the AirPods Pro 3, because in addition to the more contoured design, they also come with five sets of ear tips to ensure a more secure fit. The AirPods were already great workout buds, but the better fit and the new heart-rate-sensing feature that links to the Move ring and step count on your iPhone, and also the Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy feature.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>Active Noise Cancellation is a notoriously greedy feature when it comes to battery life, but the AirPods Pro 3 give you 8 full hours of ANC listening time on a single charge, and 10 hours in Transparency mode, even if you engage the Hearing Aid feature that’s been carried over and enhanced from the AirPods Pro 2. The Hearing Aid feature now has automatic Conversation Boost and active Hearing Protection to safeguard your ears when the environment around you gets overly loud. (Think live sporting events or construction zones.)</p>
<p>If putting the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 on sale is Apple’s opening move for Black Friday and Cyber Week, it’s a sign of a truly epic holiday shopping season to come. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">This Amazon deal for $220 is the lowest price yet on the AirPods Pro 3, and they’re a worthy upgrade even from their famously great predecessors.</a></p>

              <p><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>‘s legendary Lord Yuri, Udo Kier, has died aged 81. The news of the death of the well-loved German actor on Sunday morning was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/">shared by his partner</a> Delbert McBride, followed by an impassioned online tribute from Hideo Kojima.</p> <p>For games players, Kier is most immediately identifiable as Lord Yuri, in what’s widely considered to be one of the best&nbsp;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games,&nbsp;<em>Red Alert 2</em>. Leader of the Soviet Psychic Corps, Yuri was the antagonist of the game, and the star of the esteemed expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Yuri’s Revenge</em>. The <em>C&amp;C</em> games were famous for their use of FMV and real-world actors, making Kier a very familiar face to a generation of strategy gamers.</p>

 <p>Over his career, Kier appeared in over 220 films, working with legends like Lars von Trier, Werner Herzog, Gus Van Saint and Alexander Payne, and most recently was due to star in Hideo Kojima’s mysterious next game,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>. In the game, co-written with Jordan Peele, Kier was due to play one of the lead roles, alongside Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer. Kojima reacted to the news of Kier’s death this morning on X, calling the actor an “icon of his time.”</p>

 <p>According to Kojima’s post,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>‘s filming (the game, like so many of the creator’s, was due to use motion capture and astonishingly photorealistic faces for its characters) was delayed until 2026 by the recent voice actors strike, meaning none of Kier’s scenes have been shot. Kojima stated that despite this, the two had stayed in close contact, emailing one another and meeting up as recently as September. “He told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year,” said the video game director.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly.<br>Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “OD” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in… <a href="https://t.co/aRpP1i38CE">pic.twitter.com/aRpP1i38CE</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Still a prolific actor in his 80s, Udo Kier had multiple projects in pre-production at the time of his death alongside&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, on top of the three movies in which he’d already appeared this year. Other video game roles for the actor included 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Martha Is Dead</em> and 2017’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: WWII</em>, but his portrayal as the ESP-wielding Lord Yuri will always be his most iconic.</p>

<p>Hytale will feature a tribute to Technoblade in future after permission was granted by the content creator’s father, with fans urged to submit their ideas for the tribute.</p>



<p>Youtuber Technoblade, who passed in June 2022 after a battle with cancer, was a prominent Minecraft YouTuber, often using the Hypixel server that eventually spawned into Hytale, and he is set to be commemorated in the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-technoblade-tribute-coming-to-hytale">Technoblade Tribute Coming to Hytale</h2>



<figure><figcaption>In memorium. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1992443358602572006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared that the team had received the blessing of Technoblade’s father to “add something in Hytale that represents Technoblade’s memory.”</p>



<p>He added that Technoblade was “a big part of our journey with Hypixel,” and he wishes for “him to be a part of this one as well,” and the doors are now open to suggestions.</p>



<p>Players have been urged to submit their ideas for a “meaningful tribute” for Technoblade, who, it was revealed, applied to work for Hypixel Studios’ marketing team a decade ago but was too young at the time.</p>



<p>Suggestions shared on social media so far include rare odds for a pig to spawn as Techoblade, a special weapon, or a boss fight.</p>



<p>Technoblade already received a tribute in Minecraft after his passing, with the splash image for the title showcasing a pig wearing a golden crown—a callout to the iconic skin he used in his videos.</p>



<p>After revealing his diagnosis with cancer in August 2021, Technoblade raised over $300,000 dollars for the Sarcoma Foundation of America, smashing the quarter of a million goal within two hours, and his YouTube channel posthumously reached 20 million subscribers in May 2025.</p>

<figure data-uuid="02b59d3d9989a"><a title="Micro sd express shortages?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b59d3d9989a/micro-sd-express-shortages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Storage-hungry consumers in Japan have been jumping on available stocks of super-fast MicroSD cards as an ongoing memory shortage continues across the computer industry, with no signs of getting better in the immediate future.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>, a spiralling issue of rising costs and demand that's far exceeding availability means empty shelves and insane prices as regular consumers swoop on anything that's left over once large data centres and AI companies have bought up their fill. Oh, AI, is there anything you can't make worse?</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/spv/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a>, Tokyo-based vendor Techhouse Toei said that its inventory had been very badly affected. "The larger versions of popular series keep running out of stock...This might drag on for a while." With all sizes of MicroSD cards, from 256GB all the way up to 2TB models involved, it's not hard to see how or why consumers (and those pesky AI centres) might start to make the jump en masse to new and improved MicroSD Express technology used in Switch 2.</p>
<figure data-uuid="becc08a4273ea"><a title="Micro sd express shortages?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/becc08a4273ea/micro-sd-express-shortages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Have you picked up one of these yet? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The report goes on to detail how even older tech, such as HDD drives with huge storage capacities, is being bought up. "It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use," one shop owner said, "so we aren't getting any stock at all. Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately… and the cycle repeats."</p>
<p>It's certainly something that's already been an issue here in the West, and even through our own personal searching for MicroSD Express cards online, it's been notably hard to find sizes beyond 256GB for anything approaching a reasonable price, and the 1TB options are already being sold for...well, a quick search indicates around £200, which is quite a lot.</p>
<p>Some of this, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/microsd-express-cards-are-selling-out-thanks-to-switch-2-fever">has been down to the popularity of Nintendo's console</a>, but there's little doubt that any further stress on MicroSD availability would make it significantly harder to find a card for your Switch 2.</p>
<p>With no signs of the supply situation abating, and with AI being the number one reason cited behind all of the shortages of storage, RAM, and GPUs, it does seem as though the prepared Switch 2 gamer should perhaps brace for the inevitable impact and nab some backup storage ASAP.</p>

			<p>Nintendo first-party developed games rarely get discounts, but the Japanese publisher decided to briefly amend their pricing strategy just in time for Black Friday 2025, offering some of its best Nintendo Switch games at reduced prices.</p>



<p>Among the Switch games that can be purchased for reduced prices this week is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Mario Odyssey</strong>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ/?tag=wccftech0a9-20">available for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">$39.99</strong></a> (50% off the MSRP). The game is also fully playable on Nintendo Switch 2, so if you never played the game before and own any of the Switch systems, there's no better time to get it, and experience what is widely considered one of the best 3D Mario games ever.</p>



<p>Other notable Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2025 deals include <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Splatoon 3, Princess Peach: Showtime, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong>, and many others. You can check out all the deals available this week by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nintendo+switch+games&amp;i=black-friday&amp;language=en_US&amp;crid=2AY0R6066IY62&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;linkId=ad1a5b1f9f5ebcd44c4563e3b1540d00&amp;sprefix=ps5+g%2Cblack-friday%2C517&amp;tag=wccftech0a9-20&amp;ref=as_li_ss_tl">heading over to Amazon.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-go-for-these-nintendo-switch-black-friday-2025-deals-now-or-wait">Should You Go For These Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2025 Deals Now or Wait?</h2>



<p>As Black Friday 2025 is still a few days away, some additional deals are expected to become available as we get closer to November 28.</p>



<p>However, given Nintendo's historical stance on pricing and their previous Black Friday deals, it is doubtful you will be able to find better discounts than these in the next couple of days. Nintendo’s first-party titles are known to maintain their value for years. As such, you should definitely take advantage of these deals as soon as possible before stock runs out.</p>

            <p>Right, time for some box news. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>. Valve have confirmed, or <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-not-like-a-console/">reaffirmed</a>, that its yet-to-be-revealed price will be in line with a regular PC built to similar specs, rather than subsidised in order to try and compete with consoles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking on Skill Up's  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvu66Y2VLq8">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais said the device's price still hasn't been settled on internally due to some factors which are "fluctuating", but said the aim's to offer a "good deal" compared to a the sorts of existing PCs which offer comparable bang for your buck.</p>
<p>He went on to confirm that the price won't be subsidised by Valve in an effort to keep it on the lower end and compete with consoles, an idea that's been floated around on the lines since the box's reveal. To be honest, as someone who can't currently see where the Steam Machine would fit into my existing setup of a decently beefy desktop and a PS5, that'd be something in its favour, but I'm also conscious that I may well just not be the target audience for the thing. Then again, I'm also yet to invest in a Steam Deck despite regularly being told I likely won't regret it, so maybe I just don't like spending money.</p>
<p>"It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," Griffais said of the Machine. "Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you’re making your own gaming PC from parts." Those features are the likes of its small size, quietness, and ability to be easily flicked on via TV remote or controller.</p><p>Basically, a level of ease or convenience which he reckons is "not really something that exists in the PC market right now". That sounds very much like an 'appeal to newbies considering making the switch' pitch to me, but could also have some catchet with folks who're just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-valve-creates-an-entry-point-for-living-room-pcs-the-console-beating-steam-machines-will-follow-argues-baldurs-gate-3s-publishing-director">keen not to muck around with a/their big PC</a> for everything but the most hairdryer-inducing behemoths (hi, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>).</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to see what number Valve finally settle on and judge things from that. Until that point, there are far more important conversations to be had, as James dipped his toe into last week when he tried to define <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-search-of-soul-with-the-steam-machine">whether the Steam Machine has soul</a>. Can PC hardware be Aretha Frankliny? Probably, I guess.</p>

              <p>Samsung launches new flagship tablets every year and the latest models, like the Tab S11 series, easily cost upwards of $1,000. The 2024 Galaxy Tab A9+ finds its place in the <strong>middle of budget and premium</strong> and offers solid specs without the price of a flagship. You get an 11-inch tablet ready to provide a quality Android experience for consumption, casual gaming and productivity tasks. Now down to just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">$149 from $219 for the 64GB/WiFi, it has reached a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Screen Entertainment</h2>
<p>It has an<strong> 11-inch display running at a resolution of 1920 x 1200</strong>, and provides sharp text and detailed video playback. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> gives you a noticeably smoother scrolling through apps and websites compared to the more common 60Hz on tablets. Peak brightness reaches 480 nits to give you good visibility outdoors or in bright rooms. The TFT LCD panel does a solid job with color reproduction-whether you’re watching shows, browsing photos, or reading e-books.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos powered quad speakers</strong> turn this tablet into a surprisingly capable media machine. Movies, TV shows, and music will all be augmented by the increased audio that fills a room. The speakers feature directional sound, a more immersive experience than that of single or dual speaker arrangements. You can comfortably watch content without having to use headphones and actually hear what is being said.</p>



<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 69<strong> processor performs everyday tasks with competent performance</strong>. Streaming video, web browsing, social media scrolling, and casual gaming are relatively smooth. Similarly, 4GB of RAM manages multiple apps open simultaneously without excessive slowdown. You won’t mistake this for a flagship tablet when running demanding games or heavy multitasking, but it covers the basics reliably. The 64GB of internal storage <strong>expands up to 1TB via microSD card</strong> and gives you room for downloaded content and files.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multi Window Display</em> lets you run multiple apps side by side on the large screen</strong>: Browse the web while checking email, take notes while doing video calls, or refer to a document while writing in another app. This split-screen functionality turns the tablet into a productivity tool for real work: students can research and write papers in parallel, professionals can manage spreadsheets while being part of video conferences.</p>



<p>Quick Share makes it easy to transfer files across devices: <strong>Send photos, videos, or documents to other nearby Samsung devices, Android phones, or even iPhones</strong>. Choose the file you want to share, select the device nearby, and voilà! In a few seconds, your file transfers wirelessly. No more need for pesky email attachments or cloud uploads for simple file sharing. Immediately swap vacation photos with family members.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is $149 which means it offers solid tablet performance at an accessible price. You’re getting an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, expandable storage up to 1TB, multi-window multitasking, and Samsung Kids parental controls for 32% off retail.</p>

<p>Hytale devs are working on two significant social features to add to the game, with proximity chat and the potential of ‘portals’ in single-player that allow friends to join your game without having to tweak settings.</p>



<p>News on Hytale continues to come thick and fast following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founders reacquiring the title from Riot Games</a>, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing revealed last week</a> and details on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release date</a> arriving in the coming days.</p>



<p>The early access launch will be a major step for the future of Hytale, but there is still a lot to come, and two major features have been revealed.</p>

<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an in-depth interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcmNb40D6Vg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ElRichMC</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme answered a range of questions about the development of Hytale and plans for the future, alongside taking the opportunity to reveal two components that are in the works.</p>



<p>One of those is support for multiplayer in single-player worlds, allowing players to have drop-in, drop-out gameplay with friends, but, in a bid to make it more immersive, the current plan is for an item that needs to be built to access the feature.</p>



<p>“I want the game to be more social, so I was thinking, what if, to invite your friends, you have to make a portal? And when you leave the game, they go out from that portal, to make it more immersive,” Collins-Laflamme said.</p>



<p>While this may seem like a simple feature, it’s added that “some other popular games don’t have it,” and the crucial aspect is the ability to “invite your friend with no need to change your firewall settings.”</p>



<p>Another feature that goes hand-in-hand with the planned multiplayer functionality is proximity chat, which is confirmed to be in the works, but Collins-Laflamme admitted he’s “not sure” whether the feature will be available at the early access launch.</p>



<p>Voice chat is “very important” for Hytale, opening the doors for plenty of other experiences to be built, particularly given the expansive modding support the game will have.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Sidekicks feature looks set to receive a huge flock of collabs, according to leakers, as a major agreement with Paramount is said to have been reached.</p>



<p>The Sidekicks feature was added earlier this month, featuring customizable pets, visible only to you and players in your party, in specific modes, and additional Sidekicks are expected to be added regularly.</p>



<p>A first collab Sidekick has been added in The Simpsons season, with Scratchy coming in the Itchy &amp; Scratchy bundle, and other animated stars are on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-paramount-ips-coming-to-fortnite-as-sidekicks">Paramount IPs Coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Paramount</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable Fortnite leakers, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1992656693499756589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">including SamLeakss</a>, Paramount IPs are coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks, which aligns with previous leaks indicating collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>.</p>



<p>No specifics have been shared on what collabs to expect, but there is a lengthy list of potentials, with Paramount’s expansive list of IPs including the likes of SpongeBob, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, and more.</p>



<p>Some of those franchises, including TMNT and Transformers, have already featured as collabs in the past, including with skins, but the new Sidekick feature opens the door for other characters, smaller in size, to feature.</p>



<p>One of the biggest franchises under the Paramount umbrella that would certainly fit the Sidekicks theme is Paw Patrol, though the show is geared to a younger audience and may therefore not be suited to featuring in Fortnite.</p>



<p>An agreement with Paramount opens the door for plenty of options, and time will tell exactly what will be added to the game, but it’s clear Epic Games has big fans to utilize Sidekicks in more collabs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SIVGA Robin SV021 Wired Headphones Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/24/sivga-robin-sv021-wired-headphones-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sivga-robin-sv021-wired-headphones-review.1362562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve been fascinated with headphones from an early age. My dad was a broadcast journalist and a real geek, filling our house with space-age tech like reel-to-reel players, condenser microphones, and CB radios. Most important, though, were the headphones. Huge, unwieldy things for my tiny head, they still opened my eyes – and ears – to just how good music could sound, and that fascination has stayed with me ever since.</p>
<p>So my interest was piqued by SIVGA’s latest, the Robin SV021, a closed-back, wired audiophile pair of over-ear headphones, which boast earcups crafted from wood. While they look genuinely beautiful, the sound they produce is even better.</p>



<p>Each of the Robin SV021’s earcups are handmade from Rosewood. If you want a pair of headphones that’s immediately different from the metal and black plastic-toting ones elsewhere, it’s a great place to start. Imprinted with the SIVGA logo, the external surface is perfectly smooth, and the wood carries a warmth and softness that plastic and metal simply can’t. I did worry about their durability, but after cramming the Robin into my bag on more than one occasion, they remained unblemished.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the headband is wrapped in leather, with a thin slice of memory foam beneath it, while the frame, extenders and hinges are made from rigid, burnished metal. It’s all finished off by a pair of the plushest, softest ear cushions I’ve come across in a while, and they feel absolutely fantastic, moulding around your ears and providing a decent level of passive noise cancellation as well. The Robin SV021 look and feel utterly premium, and they definitely punch above their £150 price point.</p>

<p>Audio is handled by dual wiring to each earcup, with the two ends of the braided cable leading down to a single gold-plated 3.5mm jack. While the braided section is noise-free, the single cabling to each earcup will produce cable noise if rubbing against clothing, which does make it less appealing for listening while on the go.</p>

<p>That’s not its main draw, though. The Robin SV021 are reassuringly universal, and I’ve spent my time hopping between a MacBook, Nintendo Switch 2 and my PC. It has a relatively low impedance at 32 Ohms, and it performed well with every device I tried, with plenty of volume while retaining an excellent level of detail.</p>
<p>The SIVGA Robin SV021 sound excellent. The 50mm drivers are capable of moving plenty of air around, and there’s a wonderfully wide soundstage here, giving instrumentation and audio some real room to breathe. I’ve been playing a huge amount of Octopath Traveler 0 on its way to review, and the orchestral soundtrack has been delivered exquisitely by the Robin SV021, with that wider soundstage making it feel as though you’re experiencing a live recording.</p>
<p>They’re absolutely perfect for gaming, thanks to their lightweight design and ultra-soft ear cushions. I was able to wear them for hours, and they may well be the most comfortable headphones I’ve reviewed this year.</p>

<p>Checking in with my music collection, I loved how enveloping Gunship’s Tech Noir sounded, with the throbbing synth tones delivered with an exacting level of detail. The intro’s sci-fi spoken word sits clearly apart from the ominous notes beneath, while the bass response is excellent, with plenty of warmth and clarity. The Robin SV021 are certainly warmer-sounding rather than clinical, and they’re easy to live with across a range of different genres and content types. Crucially, they make you want to listen to music.</p>
<p>At £150, the Robin SV021 are aimed at the mid-range audiophile who’s looking for something a little different. Despite their closed-back design, they boast a wide soundstage, and their well-balanced tuning provides a hugely enjoyable listening experience no matter what you’re using them for.</p>

			<p>As FromSoftware continues working on Elden Ring Nightreign, the Japanese development studio is also hard at work on The Duskbloods, which reportedly is a game the developer has spent time on fine tuning gameplay the most.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ziostorm">Ziostorm</a>, a Chinese journalist who provided accurate information on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a> before the game's release, recently revealed some small, exciting tidbits about FromSoftware's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. The game was reportedly greenlit even before the marketing campaign for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> started, and it is the game that FromSoftware has spent the most time on gameplay among all of their games.</p>



<p>All the time spent on prototyping The Duskbloods' gameplay is reportedly paying off, as the game, although PvEvP, features many innovative gameplay elements that the team is really proud of. So much so that the journalist speculates the game could influence games from other studios as much as the aforementioned Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice did, especially with the parry mechanics that are now prevalent in almost every action game.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small bit of information on The Duskbloods, the known Chinese journalist also revealed that we should see more of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/">Elden Ring Nightreign DLC, The Forsaken Hollow</a>, soon. Apparently, three more trailers should be released before the game launches on December 4 to showcase the two new Nightfarers - the Scholar and the Undertaker - and the new content in a final launch trailer. As the expansion is nearing release, these trailers, if they are indeed coming, shouldn't be more than a few days away.</p>

<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">When it was revealed during the first Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct ever earlier this year</a>, many, including myself, jumped at the screen at the first footage of The Duskbloods, as the game looked like a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/bloodborne/">Bloodborne</a>. However, the Switch 2 exclusive is going to be a much different game, having been built from the ground up as a multiplayer experience, which left a few disappointed, as FromSoftware is primarily known for its single-player experiences with multiplayer elements sprinkled on top.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the game's supposed innovative gameplay elements will make it a compelling experience for all fans of the studio, possibly turning doubters' opinions around as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign did for me when it launched earlier this year on PC and consoles.</a></p>

            <p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> has avoided yet another shutdown after being ressurected in server-emulated form by fans <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">earlier this year</a>. According to the modders behind its revival project, The Crew Unlimited, a bug would have seen the game stop working once 2029 rolled around. Thankfully, they say a solution's been found.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This may be one of the most important updates we've ever released, or arguably THE most important," reads <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-update-tcuserver-1.3.0.0">a post</a> from lead developer Whammy4 about The Crew Unlimited's latest server emulator update, 1.3.0.0. They outlined that not long after the server emulator's 1.0 release, the group realised that if the date on the PC it's being played on is set to something after June 2029, the game simply stops working.</p>
<p>"As you may imagine, we were extremely concerned (how many deaths is this game going to go through? TWO weren't enough already?)," Whammy4 explained. "At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end, but that turned out to not be the case. It is an issue within the actual game client itself, and is not intentional but rather a bug. From our research, we've narrowed it down to either the Summit calendar system (from the Wild Run 2015 update), or the daily Crate mission system (from the Calling All Units 2016 update). Likely culprit is the Summit, even though nothing in the summit calendar data references anything about a June 2029 or 2029 in general."</p>
<p>The good news is that the team say they've found "a less than ideal, but working fix" for this potentially lethal bug, which they've dubbed "Y29K", by making some changes to the server emulator's software. So, crisis averted, even if it sounds like more work may be needed to try and find a better solution for the long-term.</p><p>Here's hoping The Crew can manage to go a few years without any more existential threats from this point, even if its initial shutdown's had the silver lining of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">sparking worthwhile debate</a> about what the end of service for online-only games should look like going forwards.</p>

His first American role came in 1991 film My Own Private Idaho, which starred River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. Madonna, a fan of Kier's work, cast him in her music videos for Erotica and Deeper and Deeper. Later notable roles came in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Johnny Mnemonic, Armageddon, End of Days, and Blade. Kier’s final film was the political thriller The Secret Agent, in which he played a Jewish Holocaust survivor caught in the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as starring in hundreds of films, Kier was no stranger to the world of video games. He famously played Yuri in the live-action cutscenes that formed a part of Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2’s story, and reprised the role in 2001’s Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri's Revenge.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>RIP Udo Kier, who passed away today at the age of 81.</p><p>His performance as Yuri in Red Alert 2 has always stuck with me, and it’s one I constantly reference.

Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot OD for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual ‘Udo-isms.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I still can’t believe this. Udo wasn’t just an actor. He was truly an ‘icon’ of his time.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> has announced a new update in December titled 'Home Sweet Home', which includes a vast amount of base customisation options as well as a crossover with one of the coolest indie games in recent memory. It's set to release just around the corner too, on the 17th December.</p>
<p>This game is Ultrakill, the high-intensity ultraviolent FPS by Arsi Patala, which is coming to Pocketpair's open world creature collection game. As part of the Home Sweet Home update, players will be able to venture the world as either V1 or V2, reflecting bullets off flipped coins and blasting away Pals with a new shotgun.</p>
<p>When not murdering animals in-game, you'll be able to change the colours of your bases through new customisation tools which should make your abode feel more homely. A variety of colours can be seen in the new trailer, all of which are quite vibrant.</p>

<p>Palworld and Pocketpair continue trucking along all this time after its explosive release back in 2024. As you may know, the developer has been in the midst of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">a legal battle with Nintendo over alleged patent infringement</a>. This has actually been leaning in Pocketpair's favour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">with a recent rejection of Nintendo's patent</a> throwing a spanner in the works for Nintendo.</p>
<p>In addition, earlier this month Nintendo's patent covering the summoning of a sub character to battle an enemy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-suffers-another-potential-blow-as-us-takes-rare-step-of-re-examining-previously-granted-pokemon-patent">was ordered to be reassessed in the USA</a>. A rare occasion that too could spell trouble for Nintendo's lawsuit.</p>

<figure data-uuid="df1e6e9ca6684"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df1e6e9ca6684/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK physical gaming charts are in, giving us our first indication of how Nintendo's latest is performing on store shelves. You'll have to scroll a little way to find the new first-party release this week, mind you, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has missed out on a top 10 spot!</p>
<p>The game zoomed into 12th in its debut week, falling behind the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and — of course — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, all of which keep the Switch and Switch 2 in the upper bracket.</p>
<p>Of course, this might not be all that much of a surprise. Air Riders was always going to attract a niche audience with its blend of racing and all-out action, and with Mario Kart World still appearing new and shiny, we'd imagine that many people will be picking up just the one racer for their fresh console. We're sure the sales will be drastically different in Japan, which we'll find out later this week</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> parried its way back into the top 10 — thanks to all of those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-game-awards-nominees-announced-donkey-kong-bananza-up-for-goty">Game Awards nominations</a>, no doubt — and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-hades-2s-switch-2-physical-boasts-a-stunning-reversible-cover">sweet physical edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> made its debut at number 21. And if you're looking for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, you won't find it in <em>this</em> top 40...</p>

            <p>Well, that was quick. Season two of Prime Video's Fallout show is still weeks away from arriving on December 17th, but a group of modders have wasted no time in studying its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">latest trailer</a> and taking a crack at adding the NCR ranger power armour shown off to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p>
<p>Can't take a break and wait for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-anniversary-update-didnt-quite-land-with-the-impact-many-hoped-for-so-nexus-mods-have-assembled-their-own">anniversary update's fallout</a> to totally dissipate when there's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-latest-modathon-has-flying-robots-evolving-gear-and-cheeky-waving-in-its-pockets">modathon</a> on, I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway, enter the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98482?tab=description">Ranger Power Armour</a> released by modder PrincessAries and co over the weekend. While not an exact replica, it's based on the armour that shows up in the most recent season two trailer (which I've embedded above) at around the two minute and ten second mark, with its wearer walking into a street wild west-style alongside The Ghoul.</p><p>The mod's armour is designed to be similar in stats to the Fallout series' iconic T-51 power armour, mirroring it being a custom set the NCR have developed, rather than the scavenged T-45d Brotherhood sets sometimes seen on NCR soldiers in New Vegas.</p>
<p>As with a lot of the best power armour mods, this set comes with a wide range of customisation options, including four different base paint jobs. One of those is a lick of red paint so you can sacreligiously use the armour to show how into Caesar's Legion you are. Where the mod really shines, though, is in the various accessories you can add to each bit of the armour for a different look and some stat buffs.</p>
<p>The likes of cloaks, backpacks, bandoliers, and helmet lenses can be mixed and matched to create a unique look. I'm a particular fan of the brahmin skulls strapped to your shoulders and enough bullet casings draped over you to be a human ammo box aesthetic, as well as the hoods which make you look like an unruly fusion-powered teenager. Though, it is worth noting that the modders admit the cloaks in particular can be subject to some clipping misbehavior, especially if you opt for a hooded one.</p>
<p>To get the armour, you'll need to have the Far Harbor DLC, then install the mod and head to a small shack north of the power station outside the ruined town of Natick for a short quest. Given this kind of thing's happening already, I'm keen to see what sorts of mods might arrive once season two's actually aired, assuming it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-s3-episode-15-everyone-loves-fallout-and-the-fallout-tv-show">gets folks going</a> like the first one did.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a fresh report from NewZoo, it has been confirmed that ARC Raiders skyrocketed within just two days on the market, beating many of the world’s most capable and impactful games in October’s revenue charts. The data revealed that ARC Raiders secured the seventh spot in the charts in October, despite being released on October 30.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be one of the most transformative games ever released, taking over the extraction shooter genre and retaining an enormous player base almost a month after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-on-top-almost">ARC Raiders On Top (Almost)</h2>



<p>In an all-new October revenue report from NewZoo, it was documented that ARC Raiders hit the seventh spot in the charts despite being on the shelves for just two days in October.</p>



<p>It effortlessly walked over some of the biggest games in the business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>VALORANT</li>



<li>ROBLOX</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>



<p>The stunning achievement sat ARC Raiders behind the likes of NBA 2K26, Fortnite, Ghost of Yotei, and Battlefield 6, all of which is/were to be expected.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun gamers worldwide, and everyone from diehard extraction shooter fans to those totally new to the concept is getting on board. Recently, a streamer-backed initiative saw some of the biggest creators in the space take part in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">unofficial ‘war’</a> that pulled unprecedented audiences into some streamers’ chats.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty roadmap in store for ARC Raiders, and Embark Studios, the game’s stellar creator, has vowed to support the title for years to come. The next major update will be <strong>Cold Snap</strong>, coming in December 2025.</p>
