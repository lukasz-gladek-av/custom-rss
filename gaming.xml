<p>During today's Pokémon Presents, Chief Creative Fellow at TPC Junichi Masuda showed off aspects of the park (at least, the concept of it). The aim was to create a world where Pokémon actually exist. The park opens in 2026, with tickets going on sale later in 2025.</p>
<p>The park is split into two — a town area, and a forest area. The town itself is like every single little town you've seen in a Pokémon game, complete with a Mart, a Pokémon Center, and places where trainers can gather.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fxtqszo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

			<p>Despite the lack of an announcement, the rumored Starfield Playstation 5 port is reportedly still happening, but it could take a while longer to launch.</p>



<p>Replying to a follower's question on X regarding the long-rumored port of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda, known insider NateTheHate stated that the port is still happening, but the release may have been slightly delayed than originally planned. The insider added that a proper update on the matter will be provided when possible.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still happening; but release may have slipped a touch later than originally planned. Will update when I can.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1947449269893665134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Starfield PlayStation 5 port releasing later than initially planned, while disappointing for those who are waiting to experience Bethesda's latest big role-playing game, is not exactly surprising, as it isn't the only project related to the game that will take longer to release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">A few days ago</a>, NateTheHate revealed that a second DLC is in the works, but it's unlikely to be released this year. If this DLC ends up being more substantial than the Shattered Space DLC, bringing new features that could improve the base game's experience as well, it wouldn't be surprising for Bethesda to launch the port alongside the new expansion, which could be called <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>.</p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive Games, the studio responsible for the likes of Bandai Namco's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>anthology series, has announced another round of layoffs.</p>

<p>Last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> as part of a "reorganization" effort; the number wasn't revealed, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that around 90 Supermassive staffers were affected.</p>

<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Supermassive says it's laying off "up to 36" employees as part of a new "redundancy consultation process". The studio cites the "challenging and ever-evolving environment" of the gaming industry as the reason for these newest cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=V1-arE7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=fhZFXXN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games is going through another round of layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>As part of this layoff wave, Supermassive also says that its upcoming "cinematic sci-fi horror adventure"&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>will be delayed until the first half of 2026. You can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands" rel="nofollow">preview of that game here</a> to find out what he thought of it.</p>

<p>If you're worried about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, you needn't be; Supermassive says that these layoffs will have "no impact on the development" of the upcoming horror puzzle-platformer, and the October 10th release date, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced last month</a>, will go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Supermassive isn't even the only studio to lay off staff in the last week or so; it joins&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs across its animation and rig team</a> this week.</p>

<p>These layoffs are also part of a broader pattern that has seen thousands of industry employees losing their jobs over the last couple of years, as well as project cancellations and studio closures galore.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how else Supermassive Games' latest layoffs affect the studio's operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
EA and DICE have decided to let players choose between locking weapons to classes in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, or being able to equip any weapon to any class. It might sound like a throwaway technicality, next to the existential terror of reports that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">EA want the new shooter to find a following of 100 million players</a>. In practice, the decision to give players the option of locking weapons to classes is Serious Business. it's the latest manifestation of a debate that goes back to Battlefield's formative squabbles with rival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> Call Of Duty in the noughties.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
First, the what, when and how. Battlefield 6 is currently in beta via the Battlefield Labs program, a program that is in theory clandestine but in practice, has proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam%22%22">leekier than a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup</a>. Oh sorry, that's me reminiscing about lunch. I mean: leakier than a colander that has been used as a helmet... possibly after being used to make a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup - we can't confirm at the time of reporting. 
</p>
<p>
Among other things, we've been treated to sneaky early glimpses of the game's classes: recon, assault, engineer and support. The restoration of something like Battlefield's old class system is welcome tidings indeed for those who hated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">Battlefield 2042's Specialists</a> - a group of wonky named characters equipped with customisable loadouts, plus a unique speciality and trait. 
</p>
<p>
However, EA spiked the enthusiasm some by revealing that while each Battlefield 6 class will have a "signature weapon" that gives them specific bonuses, any class can use any weapon. This being a bid "to have the interconnected systems and fundamentals of each class shape their role, while granting the freedom to customize how to execute that role," as detailed on <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1943692970106269912">MechaHitler.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
EA's reasoning has bred a backlash, with players complaining that this is just the old Specialist system wearing a different shade of khaki - and now, EA have relented. "Open Weapons vs Closed Weapons," declares a new post on the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">Muskvine</a>. "Why not both? Starting at Open Beta players can choose official playlists with Signature Weapons locked to class, or not. More to come."
</p>
<p>
So, what makes this more than a patch note? Well, Battlefield has always sort of been celebrated as the shooter in which classes play you.  This isn't Call Of Duty, a game in thrall to the individual killing spree, but a sim that thrives on large-scale teamwork and apocalyptic attrition.</p>
<p>That said, the teamwork focus has arguably hindered Battlefield's efforts to expand beyond the PC jarheads who fuelled its initial success, and earn the affections of casual players who just want to peacock and drop an airstrike or two. It makes the game less approachable and immediately gratifying, more reliant on people having trustworthy mates. Hence DICE's efforts to soften the focus with features such as the Specialist system.</p>
<p>In marketing terms, Battlefield's class-driven format also makes for a game that can feel rather faceless next to, say, the ultra-giffable hero shooters of the 2010s, in which every player is a star. I'm not sure any individual aspect of Battlefield has ever "gone viral" like an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> character, save for those trickshots of pilots <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re2aLmK8koA">hipfiring a bazooka in mid-air</a> and the barmier <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh9e3PDAOc">physics glitches</a>. It doesn't help that there has never been an unambiguously terrific Battlefield singleplayer mode.
</p>
<p>
As such, the decision of whether to insist that certain Battlefield 6 classes use certain guns is fraught. I imagine DICE will be very nervy about introducing anything that constrains a greenhorn player's choices in a game that - if rumour breath true - has cost over $400 million, and wants to amass a playerbase equivalent to the population of Vietnam. I guess giving people a choice of playlists is the best way forward. We'll hopefully be able to bring you some hands-on impressions soon.

On mobile devices, the game is free-to-play with microtransactions. Which isn’t great, but it’s hardly unexpected from a mobile game meant to make you check in with daily puzzles and challenges (and maybe spend a buck or two). Where things get weird, however, is that the Switch version is a $10 purchase, but still has all the microtransaction elements intact.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196646" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Basic Pack”</a></span> on Nintendo’s console includes “30 puzzles, 70 craftable plush, and all 11 yarn types.” On top of this, there are two “Puzzle On!” packs that cost $15 each, or you can buy them together for $26.

"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to those affected."</p><p>The restructure has "no impact" on the making of Little Nightmares III, Supermassive said, but the same cannot be said for Directive 8020, which is the latest entry in Supermassive's The Dark Pictures Anthology.</p><p>"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026," Supermassive said. "The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p><p>Supermassive Games is owned by Nordisk Games, which also owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios.</p><p>Supermassive Games previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-dev-supermassive-games-is-cutting-jobs/1100-6521363/" data-ref-id="1100-6521363">cut jobs in February 2024</a> with up to 150 positions impacted.

It is the first-ever permanent outdoor Pokémon attraction, and will hold its grand opening next year. Advance ticket sales are expected to begin later this year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Riot Games has revealed the eighth character for its upcoming 2v2 fighting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a>. Vi is punching through to the roster, and will be playable by the public at the Evo fighting game event early next month.</p>
<p>A closed beta for 2XKO has also been announced, starting on the 9th September. All players who have been granted access to previous Alpha Lab tests will automatically be thrown into this closed beta. Not only that, but this closed beta will roll into the games' full release.</p>
<p>With Vi's addition, 2XKO will have eight characters in total. She'll first be playable at Evo, the massive fighting game event taking place early next month. After that, you'll need to get into that closed beta to try her out, or wait until launch.</p>

<p>This reveal also comes with a gameplay trailer for Vi, showing her off in-action. She's looking like an ultra-aggressive brawler with the ability to carry enemies across the screen with relative ease, and pick 'em up off the ground for extended combos. A pure rushdown character!
</p>
<p>As for when the launch will actually be? Well, the game is still aiming for a 2025 release date as far as we know. We also know the team is targeting a 10 champion launch roster. This means, assuming plans are the same, that between today and December, we're still due two more champions reveals.</p>
<p>Vi obviously is a popular champion. Since the release of Arcane and that series' sheer popularity, both Vi and Jinx have proven fan-favourites among the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> community. Vi is also a character early 2XKO fans have speculated about for a while, given her fist-fighting style and her presence on some wall art at the 2XKO development office.</p>
<p>Are you happy with the Vi pick? Let us know down below, as well as who else you'd like to see make their way to 2XKO!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heads-up-arcane-fans-vi-has-been-revealed-as-2xkos-eighth-fighter-ahead-of-its-final-beta-landing-in-september]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s a shame that the game will miss its target release, especially when October is the traditional launch window for all sorts of scary games, looking to make the most of the Halloween spooky season. At the same time, the old saying “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad” is still relatively wise, even if it’s always been misattributed to Shigeru Miyamoto, and we now live in an age where games can be patched and made good with enough extra time and effort.</p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in The Dark Pictures series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship.</p>
<p>The team is using Unreal Engine 5 for the first time, and really looking to push the cinematic scope of the story that they’re telling. Compared to earlier games under the Dark Pictures banner, there’s full third person character control, instead of fixed camera angles – something Supermassive already did away with in later games – but Directive 8020 is pushing further toward action game territory with its take on sci-fi horror.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more and hope that the rest of development goes smoothly.</p>

<p>Just a little longer now...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Whilst we already knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, an upcoming battle-focused game for Switch and mobile platforms, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-a-new-battle-focused-game-announced-for-switch-and-mobile">was a thing that is happening</a>, extra details have been fairly thin on the ground this far, including when we'll actually get our hands on the game.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a brand new gameplay trailer which was just shown during the latest Pokémon Presents, we have some more info to dig into, most important of which, perhaps, is that the game won't arrive until <strong>2026</strong>. There's no further info on exactly when we can expect a drop, but this is a little longer than we'd expected, given that we've known about the new entry for a little while now.</p>
<p>Outside of a narrowing down of the release window, we also learned a few more positive things about the game itself, including its compatibility with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> - allowing you to transfer your collection of critters from other games into Champions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to fight in Ranked, Casual, or Private Battles and recruit Pokémon to your team using Victory Points.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for yourself above, it's certainly looking action-packed we have to say, and the inclusion of the ability to recruit in-game Pokémon to use in 1v1 and 2v2 battles sounds rather neat indeed.</p>

<p>Lookin' Mega</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprising absolutely no one, today's Pokémon Presents showcase left us with yet another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with a lengthy trailer detailing the game's story, side missions and new Mega Evolutions. And yes, there was more than a little Dragonite thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Let's start with that delightful dragon, shall we? The trailer brought us our first proper look at Mega Dragonite, which sports several "Dragonair-like features" — wings on the head, a pearl on the tail, you know the drill. We can't say that we're completely sold on the design, but more Dragonite is always a good thing.</p>
<p>You'll need to rely on newbies like this one to tackle the rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon that are springing up across Lumiose City at their own accord. The trailer gives a closer look at that Xenoblade-style combat that we were so interested in after the reveal, and yep, it still looks cool.</p>


<p>For those who weren't watching the presentation live, TPC split the Legends: Z-A section into two trailers, so you can check out the other half below to find out what the game's story will have in store.</p>

<p>If all of that takes your fancy but you haven't picked up a Switch 2 yet (and you don't want to face the Switch 1 version), Nintendo has revealed that a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-its-very-own-switch-2-bundle">Legends: Z-A Switch 2 bundle</a> will be launching alongside the game on <strong>16th October</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/supermassive-games-confirms-layoffs-with-36-people-let-go-directive-8020-delayed-into-2026.1249794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Supermassive Games released a statement in which it confirmed that the studio has laid off 36 people, cuts that it says were made for the studio to "<em>adapt our team structure to better align</em>" with the changes and challenges of the video game industry. The studio also confirmed that Directive 8020, which was due to launch this October, has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>The statement was published to the<a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211"> studio's official X account</a>, where it writes "<em>This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected</em>."</p>



<p>Directive 8020, which was announced last year at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">Gamescom 2024</a>, and was supposed to be out this coming October 2, 2025, will now release sometime in "<em>the first half of 2026</em>." Supermassive adds "<em>the response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Directive 8020 wasn't the only game Supermassive had launching in October of this year though, with the other being <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a>, which is due out on October 10, 2025, and only gets a short mention at the end of the statement, where Supermassive claims that these layoffs have "<em>no impact on the development of Little Nightmares III</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-quarry-dark-pictures-dev-supermassive-layoffs-third-of-staff/">February 2024</a>, Supermassive Games laid off a third of its staff, once again citing challenges in the changing video game industry. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod-makes-main-character-react-dynamically-to-the-world-improving-immersion.1249791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod released online a few days back makes the experience more immersive than ever before, introducing some choice improvements to main character V's behavior.</p>



<p>As the name implies, the More Responsive V mod, now available for download for free from Nexus Mod, makes the game's main character react more dynamically to the world. With the mod, V will respond vocally to being bumped, hit by vehicles, and in a lot of other scenarios where a voiced reaction is expected, such as stealing vehicles, MaxTac's arrival, and more. With the mod, which uses unused voice lines that seem to have been created specifically for similar scenarios, V will also respond to Johnny Silverhand's comments while driving in a vehicle. You can check out the mod in action by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPyNvkZuaNE">video</a>.</p>



<p>Despite having been released almost five years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 is still receiving plenty of love from CD Projekt Red and modders alike. A new 2.3 patch went live <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">last week</a>, introducing new content and features on all platforms, such as AMD FSR 4, FSR 3.1 Frame Generation support on PC and proper VRR support on consoles. The introduction of VRR support, according to Digital Foundry, is the closest we will get to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-vrr-support-closest-to-official-ps5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patch.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Picture the scene. You and someone you like are gettin' it on. Maybe with Barry White crooning away in the background, scented candles, sweaty palms. Then, one of you touches a box and boom, a bloke who's clearly come out on the wrong end of a trip to an arts &amp; crafts shop walks in with some hooks and says stuff about pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>Such is (pretty much) the way of classic 80s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> film Hellraiser, and therefore such is the plot of the trailer for the very first full game based on it. Said game's a slice of singleplayer survival horror dubbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival</a>, from Evil: Within devs Boss Team Games and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> publishers Saber Interactive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box – the Genesis Configuration – to help his girlfriend Sunny’s escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth," reads the suitable hellish blurb. "Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites."</p>
<p>In a fun twist, original actor Doug Bradley's reprised the role of Cenobite leader Pinhead in the game, and it'll be his first appearance behind the pin-laden visage in two decades.</p>

<p>Clive Barker himself's been looped in on crafting the story, and he's been a fan of Boss Team and Saber's dedication to the pursuit of gaming pleasure. "They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence — the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque — and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold," the writer and filmmaker said. "I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation."</p>
<p>Sounds cool, but maybe make sure stray children aren't likely to walk in on you playing it, given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1551980/">the Steam page</a>'s lengthy content warning. There's no release date or even window on that Steam page yet, so you'll just have to find joy in slightly less carnal pleasures for the minute.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-publishers-reveal-hellraiser-revival-a-singleplayer-horror-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead]]></content:encoded>

DJ Pikachu has been and gone, taking the latest Pokémon Direct (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOvzYU-UIcU">Pokémon Presents</a> if you must) with him. And this time around, we got Pokénews aplenty, with small furry fistfuls of new Z-A details, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> updates, a new Pokémon puzzler, and more. But if you missed it - or simply need a refresher - you'll find everything announced below.
</p>
<h3>A quick bit on this year's Pokémon World Championships</h3>
<p>
First up, a reminder that the Pokémon World Championships are coming to Anaheim, California this year. They're running from 15th-17th August, with competitors set to do battle across the likes of Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, Pokémon Go, and Pokémon Unite. All competitors get a "celebratory" promo card, so hooray. There're <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">more details over on the Pokémon website</a>.
</p>
<h3>Here's a look at Pokémon Concierge's upcoming new episodes</h3>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
Pokémon Concierge - Netflix's gorgeously animated and well-received TV spin-off - is returning to the streaming service with more episodes, and we got an eye-catching trailer to remind us of that. Better yet, there's an air date for the new episodes, which we now know will be available from 4th September.
</p>
<h3>Wallace and Gromit animation studio is making a Pokémon show</h3>

<p>
Aardman Animation, the studio behind the much-loved Wallace and Gromit series, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-meets-shaun-the-sheep-in-upcoming-aardman-stop-motion-animated-series">working on a new stop-motion Pokémon TV show</a>. It promises a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the critters' perspective, all presented using the "signature Aardman sense of character and comedy and craft". It's called Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch and Pichu and - as you can see in its teaser trailer above - looks delightful. This one's due to arrive in 2027.
</p>
<h3>A quick peek at Japan's PokéPark Kanto theme park attraction</h3>
<p>
PokéPark Kanto - the first "permanent outdoor Pokémon attraction" - is opening within Japan's Yomiuriland amusement park "soon" and we got a little taste of the activities visitors can enjoy should they find themselves within its walls. It's divided into two area, Sedge Town and the Pokémon Forest. In the forest, visitors can see various Pokémon interacting with each other, while the town is an area where Pokémon and Trainers gather. It's opening in 2026, with tickets set to go on sale later this year.
</p>
<h3>Here's what to expect from the Pokémon Go Fest 2025: Max Finale</h3>

Next, a bit of news about Pokémon Go Fest 2025: Max Finale, which runs from 23rd-24th August, heralding back-to-back appearances from various Max Pokémon, and an opportunity for players to encounter Eternatus globally for the first time. There's also a promo code - GOFESTMAX - you can enter on the website for a chance of catching a Gigantamax Pokémon.
</p>
<h3>A quick round-up of everything going on in Pokémon's mobile spin-offs</h3>
<p>
And in other mobile news, Pokémon Masters EX will see Carmine &amp; Sinistcha appear in their featured Poké Fair from 29th July to 6th September, while Lapra - in its five-star sea captain outfit - is set to appear in Pokémon Café Remix starting 23rd July until 21st August. Sea adventure-themed decorations are also being added to café customisation soon, with Alolan Mouth, Totodile, and Minccino also on the way in special crew-themed outfits "one after another".
</p>
<p>
Over in Pokémon Sleep, players can research Raikou, Entei, and Suicune this September, and a new area - Amber Canyon - arrives in November. As for Pokémon Unite, Latios joins on 18th July and Latias arrives on 8th August, all to commemorate the games fourth anniversary. 
</p>
<h3>And a sentence about the Pokémon Trading Card Game</h3>

And if that's not enough spin-off games to be getting on with, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-friends-is-a-plushie-focused-puzzle-game-and-its-out-now">there's now Pokémon Friends</a>, a Pokémon-themed mini-game puzzler featuring sliding blocks, rotating tracks, and more. Solving puzzles unlocks digital plushies you can use to decorate your in-game "plush room", and it's available today on Switch, iOS and Android.

<h3>Some Pokémon Violet and Scarlet news, including more Tera Raids</h3>
<p>
After a quick reminder Pokémon Violet and Scarlet now have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> update improving framerate and resolution, we got the news a fresh Tera Raid battle event starts tomorrow, 23rd July, featuring shiny versions of Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu, with each being available for one week starting 23rd July and ending 14th September. However, just completing a battle isn't enough to secure the Pokémon - you can only add them to your team after they've been defeated 1m times by the community. Various weekly Pokémon Mass Outbreak events are set to run concurrently, and there's also a tracksuit apparel item you can acquire by entering the code STRACKSU1T or VTRACKSU1T into Scarlet and Violet respectively.

The previously announced Pokémon Champions, which lets players battle each other in an arena using new or previous Pokémon Partners (you'll need to use Pokémon Home in order to access the latter), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-stadium-alike-new-game-pokemon-champions-gets-a-2026-release-date-in-new-action-packed-gameplay-trailer">got another airing during today's showcase</a>, offering a look at battling, the newly revealed training feature, and more. There's still no release date for Pokémon Champions yet, but it's coming to Switch, iOS, and Android next year.

<p>
And finally, the big one: Pokémon Z-A. GameFreak had plenty to say on its latest mainline Pokémon entry - here seen running on Switch 2 - including a look at Lumiose City, its story, Z-A Royale battles, side activities (including character customisation <em>and</em> customisable Furfrous), plus photo mode. You can read more on Z-A's latest showing - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">details on Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon</a> - elsewhere on Eurogamer. If you want to know what Pokés will be making an appearance, check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-returning">returning Pokémon</a> list. It's out 16th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-bundle-announced">alongside a Switch 2 bundle</a>, and that, I'm afraid, is the end of today's news.

<p>Training Pokémon like this appears to cost a type of in-game currency, though how to earn this currency has yet to been revealed in this gameplay presentation.</p>
<p>Pokémon Champions was first revealed in February of this year with a cinematic trailer, but this is the first time we've actually seen lenghty gameplay of Pokémon Champions in-action. It's safe to say that for those who are competitively minded, this is an exciting title worth looking out for.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-stadium-alike-new-game-pokemon-champions-gets-a-2026-release-date-in-new-action-packed-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playing-the-last-of-us-part-2-chronological-mode-feels-surprisingly-logical.1249740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’m a big fan of both The Last of Us games. The first game is easily one of my favourite games ever, and the second game is up there somewhere too. Combat is a real highlight for me, specifically its scrappy, improvisational nature alongside all the attention to detail that Naughty Dog lavished these games with to make each situation incredibly intense, but if I’m honest a huge part of why I love these games is the story. My only real issue with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2</a> is that the narrative pacing constantly drags me out of all the artfully built up tension with flashbacks and diversions. With the recently released Chronological Mode, I was very interested to see if that could improve, to my mind, the flow of the storytelling.</p>
<p><em><strong>BEWARE:</strong> As we’re going to discuss the story of The Last of Us Part 2, there will be spoilers for both The Last of Us games… and the TV show. Shocking, we know.</em></p>



<p>So what is chronological mode? Well, it does exactly what it says on the tin: you play through the entire game but, instead of flashing forwards and back wildly, it’s all in strictly chronological order. That means that the experience of playing the game, particularly towards the beginning, is drastically different. You actually start here playing with Abby in a brief fifteen minute intro to the character where you’re also introduced to her zebra-saving father… only to see how he’s so cruelly wrenched away from her and Joel’s role in this – it cuts to Joel cleaning his guitar whilst telling Tommy about it. Before you get to shoot a gun, you’ll be seeing all the big revelations that were saved for later parts of the game, including that incredible dinosaur/space museum scene, Owen and Abby finding an aquarium, and more.</p>
<p>So much of The Last of Us Part 2’s early narrative was hung around this mystery about Abby and her motivations for killing Joel so close to the start of the game, those revelations being held back to be revealed in flashbacks later on. Seeing everything laid out in order bring so much more depth and understanding to Abby’s character that was, for many players, masked by the same kind of instant, uninformed hatred that Ellie felt. There is, of course, an artistic link to having players so aligned with their character, but the end result was arguably too visceral for many.</p>

<p>After the introductory scenes, as the game moves on to Seattle, the chronological reordering helps to eliminate the pacing issues that I felt with the original game. Instead of the long stretches where you see just one character’s story, where the story builds up to a huge climax, only to be sent back in time and have to wait for it to build up all over again, the two sides of the timeline are interwoven. The experience of playing two characters in opposition to each other like this is quite unique.</p>

<p>There are a few oddities that are a result of this, though I’m not sure they could have really been avoided. Specifically, because Abby and Ellie are both in the same storm at one point early in the game, you witness that storm starting up twice in quick succession, but from each perspective. It’s chronological, but there’s nothing being cut, so some of the bits overlap each other anyway, and that can be a little strange.</p>
<p>It’s also fair to say that this story and the game was not designed with a chronological telling in mind. I wasn’t exaggerating when I said you don’t fire a gun for a good two or three hours and there’s lots of stuff that was saved for the latter half of the game that take up the beginning. It’s all incredibly emotional, it looks gorgeous, and contains some of the best performances in any game ever, but it’s definitely a much slower start.</p>

<p>By contrast, recutting a film or a TV series to would be much easier, but for a more natural feeling video game, the ebb and flow of gameplay would also need to be considered and adjusted, which this mode doesn’t do. Had this game been designed with a chronological story in mind, it would have been stitched together very differently, and perhaps still have had space for some of the flashbacks, like the museum visit, to be kept in place. This is&nbsp;an imperfect solution to an imperfect problem, and it does mean that it is still better to play The Last of Us Part 2 as originally designed for the first time through, with a Chronological Mode playthrough being more rewarding as a second play.</p>
<p>I do still prefer Chronological Mode so far. I haven’t finished it – it’s a long game after all – but I’m planning to just to see how different its finale hits like this. The pacing issues were my only real issue with the standard campaign anyway, and this has improved the game for me once you get passed the slower start, seeing how both sides of this conflict react to each other’s movements in sequence. I do applaud the ambition of Naughty Dog to cast Abby as a villain for the original release and then unwrap her motivations and backstory to make her sympathetic, narratively speaking, but that’s a huge undertaking to redeem a character after seeing them only through their enemy’s eyes and one that didn’t land for a large part of the audience. I can’t help but feel that the game suffered because of that angle. Perhaps doing things in the “proper” order would’ve been better?</p>

		<p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has been released, exploring a bit more of the game’s story and world that you’ll get to explore when the game launches for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">16th October 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Make the Most of Your Adventure in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eo7PmXkP0LA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer reveals more about the story of Pokémon Legends Z-A, as your character arrives in Lumiose City and is quickly invited to join Team MZ, an organisation that is intent on protecting the city of Lumiose. In the group is Urbain or Taunie – gendered characters that will be your main buddy in the game – then the fashion desinger Naveen and aspiring dancer Lida.&nbsp;They’ll be your allies when going up against the main threats to the city.</p>
<p>Lumiose, you see, is transforming into a city that’s friendlier to both Pokémon and humans, letting them cohabit in the space. What this really means is that Pokémon will wander around in Wild Zones during the day, just waiting for you to come along and chuck a Poké Ball at their heads. During the day you’ll also be able to go shopping, changing up your character’s hair style, looks, and picking from a wide range of outfits to look all stylish. If you’ve got a Furfrou, you’ll be able to give them fancy haircuts too, like a Pokémon poodle kind of thing, and then just hang around at various spots around the city with your Pokémon.</p>


<p>By night, you’ll enter into the Z-A Royale with the Pokémon you’ve caught, looking to climb the ranks… from Z… to A. As you do so, you’ll end up facing off against bosses, such as Corbeau, the leader of the very nefarious-looking Rust Syndicate.</p>
<p>They are up to no good, I have absolutely no doubt, but there’s two other characters that will help to unpick the game’s core mystery. Emma, the so-called best detective in the city, will ask for your help to investigate things, while Mable, the acting director of the Pokémon Research Lab, is probably using you to pad her portfolio and CV when applying for the main job, getting you to catch Pokémon to aid in her research and then using this to claim that she’s got great management skills and is able to motivate workers to get results, all while keeping the budget in check. Bet she calls you on the weekends for work updates too.</p>
<p>Anyway, the big new mystery is that wild creatures are suddenly able to go Mega all on their own, with Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon running rampant! You’ll have to Mega Evolution your own creatures to fight back, perhaps using the newly revealed Mega Dragonite, who now has wings sprouting out of its head and a big pearl on its tail.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and Switch 2, and fans will be keen to discover what this means for performance and graphics, after the frankly abysmal state of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on original Switch. That game was patched with Switch 2 support and now plays a whole lot better, but it’s still very rough on the original console. Z-A will bring improved resolution and performance to the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but how will it run on the base console?</p>

		<p>The Pokémon Company and Wallace &amp; Gromit creators Aardman Animations have announced the stop-motion animation Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu | Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om_7wKXw1XE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The animation is set to come out in 2027.</p>
<p>Little is known about The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu, though we can infer from the teaser trailer that Pichu and Sirfetch’d get up to mischief. Don’t believe me? Well, I don’t really know what to say.</p>
<p>The trailer blurb says:</p>

<p><em>Sirfetch’d and Pichu are front and centre as the heroes of the show, which is set in a region Trainers have explored before—one that is very close to Aardman’s heart. The series will offer a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the perspective of Pokémon, with the signature Aardman sense of character, comedy and craft.</em></p>
<p>Partnering with Aardman is sure to deliver some wonderful animation, with the studio having a litany of award-winning animated hits, starting with the original claymation Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts before getting much more ambitious with full cinematic productions like Chicken Run, The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! Shaun the Sheep Movie and last year’s TV movie Wallace &amp; Gromit Vengeance Most Fowl.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Netflix show Pokémon Concierge is set to continue with new episodes arriving on 4th September. The first season of four episodes released in 2023, with&nbsp;Dwarf Studios adapting the world of Pokémon into animated figurines and felt creatures. It’s a lovely art style.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW Pokémon Concierge Episodes ????️ | Coming September 4 to Netflix | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzL8NUUgwdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The series follows Haru, a down on her luck workaholic who gets away from it all by visiting the Pokémon Resort and becoming a concierge, working to care for Pokémon visitors to the island. The second season looks like there’s a romantic storyline.</p>

<p>Titled 'The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Aardman Animation has officially lifted the lid on its upcoming collaboration with Pokémon — and, as you'd expect, it's a TV series.</p>
<p>In today's Pokémon Presents, we got our first look at <strong>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</strong>, a stop-motion animated series that is set in "a region Trainers have explored before—one that is very close to Aardman’s heart." Weeeeell... that sounds like Galar, doesn't it?</p>
<p>The teaser doesn't show much, though we think Wooloo could give Shaun the Sheep a run for his money here. You can also spot the little Pichu's ears and Sirfetch'd's distinctive leek sword and shield.</p>
<p>The show isn't due to air until 2027, but we're already grabbing the cheese and crackers.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the teaser in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>To be clear, no, this isn't a special edition Switch 2 — the console itself is exactly the same — but it will likely pose a cheaper way to pick up the new hybrid <em>and</em> Pokémon game together.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-effect-tv-show-gets-the-benefit-of-having-the-same-production-team-the-fallout-tv-show-has.1249725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon's Fallout TV show was praised for a number of things, one of them being how well the creative team behind the show was able to recreate the world of Fallout for the small screen. Beyond the performances and the characters, it was a huge boon to see how much everything looked and felt like it was right out of the game, and thanks to some eagle-eyed fans, we know that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/">Mass Effect</a> show could look just as good. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Eurogamer</a>, writer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey,</a> who is penning the scripts for the Mass Effect adaptation and operating as an executive producer on the show, shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCIXbiuSR5R/?igsh=a2IydzBvYmVwNGFp">last November in an Instagram post</a>, that the majority of the production team behind Fallout, will be working with him on Mass Effect. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm working on a Mass Effect show for Amazon</em>," Casey wrote. "<em>We're greenlit to start our writer's room at the top of 2025. Doing this right is and has been top priority for nearly two years now (though we paused for the strike last year). We have a great pilot script and series outline, the team that Amazon has in place (same team as Fallout including the fantastic Scott Farris) is incredible. Standby for further updates. This is gonna be the next year/two years of my life. And it'll be special</em>."</p>



<p>This doesn't ensure that the Mass Effect TV show will have the entire right look and feel, or that the characters will be stellar, or that the show will be a hit overall, but it does give the show a big leg-up. Mass Effect and Fallout are similar in that they both exist within expansive worlds, where multiply stories can be told without ever treading on the same ground the game's have already walked on. </p>



<p>It's a boon to see that many of the same people who understood the asssignment in adapting Fallout are also going to be working on Mass Effect. Hopefully, we'll learn more about the series soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em>Unmatched</em>&nbsp;set was released in early 2019 and allowed players to battle with heroes from history and legend. It's expanded since its first release, looping in other IPs and more fighters from legend. The latest release for the system draws from <em>The Witcher</em> IP, which originally was a series of books before the video game and TV show, and has seen a few tabletop incarnations. <em>Unmatched: The Witcher</em>&nbsp;enters with 2 new sets, which introduce heroes and villains from <em>The Witcher</em> series. In this article, we'll have a look at how you play <em>Unmatched</em>, which heroes the new sets add, and how they play.</p>

<p>We covered the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/unmatched-robin-hood-vs-bigfoot-review" rel="nofollow">Robin Hood vs Bigfoot</a> <em>Unmatched</em> set on the site back in 2019, and recently, I've covered the board game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-review" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Old World</a>, and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-expansions-review" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>. Or if you want to know about the video game, you can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-new-benchmark-for-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Witcher 3</a> review.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-2.jpg?itok=FtljeT3R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-2.jpg?itok=zEZCYRtl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Geralt faces down Eredin in a mix of the 2&nbsp;<em>Unmatched: The Witcher</em> sets, Steel and Silver and Realms Fall.</figcaption></figure><h2>Find Your Match</h2>

<p>The core rules for <em>Unmatched</em> are the same across all the sets (except the <em>Unmatched</em>: Tales to Amaze set, which tweaks the rules to add in solo/co-op play). Players pick their fighter, and can play 1v1, a free-for-all, or a 2v2. Then, each turn, players take 2 actions (and can pick the same action twice) from moving, attacking, or scheming.</p>

<p>Attacking and scheming require players to play an attack or scheme card from their hand, and moving lets you draw a card, and then move the amount on your character's stat card. You can also play cards to boost your move, and some abilities, attacks, and schemes also let you boost them. Play continues back and forth until only one fighter remains.</p>

<p>Although the core rules are simple and straightforward (the rulebook is 20 digest-sized pages with large text and lots of examples), the depth and strategy come from the individual characters themselves. Each character has a unique stat card and deck to give them a thematic style of play. Some characters also come with 1 or more sidekicks to add another dimension to their style of play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-3.jpg?itok=NJIrA8li 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-3.jpg?itok=o_hWYTwe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unmatched: The Witcher</em> Steel and Silver lets you choose between Geralt, Ciri and the Leshen as your fighters.</figcaption></figure>

<p><i>Unmatched: </i>Silver and Steel includes 3 characters from <em>The Witcher</em> franchise. The main protagonist of the first 3 video games, Geralt of Rivia, the protagonist of the upcoming <em>The Witcher 4</em> game, Ciri, and one of the monsters from the franchise, the forest monster, the Ancient Leshen.</p>

<p>The White Wolf, Geralt of Rivia himself, as you would expect, has an aggressive deck. Most of his cards are combat-focused, and most have additional flexibility of adding additional mobility to Gerlat, drawing cards, or discarding your opponent's cards. At the start of the game, you get to build Geralt's deck, choosing between 2 sets of Potions, Armors, and Swords depending on what you're going up against. Geralt also brings along Dandelion as his sidekick, a ranged fighter with attack cards that can move your opponent's fighters and discard cards from their hand.</p>

<p>Ciri is another aggressive fighter, but her cards aren't initially as powerful as Geralt's. Instead, most of the cards in her deck have a Source icon, and other cards gain power, depending on how many Source cards are in your discard pile. The Lion Cub of Sintra attack card, for example, has a printed value of 2, but 4 with 1 Source card in the discard pile, and 7 with 5 Source cards in the discard pile. Ciri deploys with Ihuarraquax, who has cards that let them move and damage foes after combat, and search for Source cards from the deck.</p>

<p>The Ancient Leshen has extremely powerful attacks, and also adds +3 to attack card values if it has already attacked that turn. It has 13 cards in its deck with a printed value of 4 or more. Powerful as it is, the Leshen is slow, with a move of 1, so it can be easily kept at range by your opponents. The Leshen does have cards that let it move to any space after combat, and has 2 fast wolves as sidekicks, but getting that super-powerful second attack can be a challenge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-4.jpg?itok=WrjcmZhx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-4.jpg?itok=YiuY4hxY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unmatched: The Witcher</em> Realms Fall lets you choose between Yennefer/Triss, Philipa and Eredin as your fighters.</figcaption></figure><h2>Realms Fall</h2>

<p><i>Unmatched: </i>Realms Fall includes 3 (technically 4) characters from <em>The Witcher</em> franchise. The powerful sorceresses and Geralt's love interests across the franchise, Yennefer and Triss, another powerful Sorceress, Philippa Eilhart, and the big bad from <em>The Witcher 3</em>,&nbsp;Eredin Bréacc Glas.</p>

<p>If you choose Yennefer and Triss, you then have to pick between them for your hero and sidekick. Both come with miniatures and sidekick tokens that represent them, and 2 stat cards depending on who you choose as the hero. Their deck remains the same, regardless of whom you choose, as most of their cards can be used by either, with 3 Yennefer and 2 Triss only cards.</p>

<p>They have a good mix of offense and defense, with Yennefer's Incinerate card having a printed attack value of 7, but can be ignored by your opponent discarding 2 cards. Triss's Merigold's Hailstorm card only has a printed attack value of 4, but your opponent must also either discard 2 cards, deal 3 damage to their hero, or discard the top 4 cards from their deck. The main difference between the pair is that if you choose Triss as the hero, her ability lets you deal 2 damage to a fighter adjacent to her after playing a scheme, and if you choose Yennefer, her ability means that attacks can be boosted.</p>

<p>Philippa and her sidekick, the powerful spymaster Dijkstra, have a defensive deck that likes to force your opponent to discard cards and cycle through their deck. Their offensive and defensive cards can block the value of your opponent's cards and also allow you to choose which card they play. Philippa's ability means that you're never short of cards yourself, and can always draw up to 4 cards at the end of your turn.</p>

<p>All of the fighters in both <em>Unmatched: The Witcher </em>boxes have ongoing scheme cards, which persist after playing as long as you meet the criteria. Philipa's Polymorph card, using her ability to turn into an Owl, means she can be placed in any space, and then her movement value is raised to 5, as long as at the end of your turn, you're not in a zone with an opposing fighter.</p>

<p>Eredin, as King of the Wild Hunt, brings along 4 Red Riders as sidekicks. You'll want to throw the Red Riders at your opponent, because once they're all off the battlefield, Eredin becomes enraged, adding 1 to all of his combat cards and boosting his move to 3.</p>

<p>Almost all of his cards gain extra abilities, usually extra damage once he's enraged, so throw your Red Riders at your opponent, and then bear down on them with Eredin for the kill. Eredin's cards aren't super powerful, but they deal consistent damage, and he can be pretty unrelenting. The Wild Hunt attack/defence card deals 1 damage to every fighter that's adjacent to one of your fighters, allowing you to remove a lot of weak sidekicks quickly with some clever positioning.</p>

<h2>Unmatched: The Witcher Realms Fall and Steel and Silver Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>In a vacuum, the<i> Unmatched: The Witcher </i>boxes give a great thematic <em>The Witcher</em> experience. Each character feels thematically unique with Geralts' changing deck options, Eredin's relentlessness, Ciri's growing power, the almost stationary but powerful Leshen, the controlling and wily Philipa, and the powerful ranged sorceress combination of Triss and Yennefer.</p>

<p>The <em>Unmatched</em> system is straightforward and extremely easy to learn, letting you focus on the strategy of the fighter you've chosen. The variation and replayability come from that variety, so the more fighters you have, the longer it lasts.</p>

<p>Both Steel and Silver and Realms Fall both have 3 fighters, so a single box definitely feels like it has a finite amount of games before things start to feel samey. Having both boxes improves that, and long-time fans of <em>Unmatched</em> will find 6 unique and fun fighters to add to their games. Fans of <em>The Witcher</em> coming into <em>Unmatched</em> with these sets will find an accessible system, a great mix of characters that feel like the characters they know and love.</p>

This is usually where we get a bunch of updates on live-service games like <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, and <em>Go</em>, as well as a more substantial look at whatever RPG is in development over at Game Freak. As expected, <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A </em>made an appearance, and there were a few surprises along the way. If you want to watch the full presentation you can do so below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p><h2 id="h1538"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div><div><p>The stream began with a pre-show of sorts with a DJ set hosted by a pair of DJs Pikachu. (Much like “attorneys general,” DJs Pikachu is the correct plural here.) The music selections included some pretty rad electronic remixes of classic <em>Pokémon </em>music. Release the tracks on streaming, TPC!</p></div><div><p>Kicking off the Presents is a look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, the amazing stop-motion show on Netflix. Haru is still working at the resort and has an unruly Sealeo to take care of, but she also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend Kent showing up. The show looks just as wholesome and soul-cleansing as season one. The new episodes will premiere on Netflix on September 4. </p></div><div><p>A new stop-motion series is also in development called <em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu. </em>The charming teaser features a Wooloo calmly grazing as all kinds of Pokemon-related shenanigans are happening just out of view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A new outdoor attraction is opening up in Japan. Made to look like a real forest and town featuring statues and attractions based on Pokémon, it’s set to open in 2026. Tickets will go on sale later this year.</p></div><div><p>Now for the game updates. <em>Pokemon Go</em>’s next Go Fest event, Max Finale, will take place on August 23 and 24, and will feature Max Pokemon, including Eternatus.</p></div><div><p>We didn’t see much of <em>Pokémon Masters EX</em> this time, but Carmine &amp; Sinistcha will join the game on July 29 as a sync pair.</p></div><div><p>A bunch of pirate-themed characters and cosmetics are coming to the puzzle game/management sim <em>Pokémon Cafe ReMix</em>, including a captain outfit for Lapras, Alolan Meowth, Totodile, and Minccino. You can also recruit a summer-themed Jigglypuff to help out at your cafe.</p></div><div><p>The Legendary Beasts are coming to <em>Pokemon Sleep</em>, so expect to see Suicune, Entei, and Raikou show up in your research in September. A new area called Amber Canyon is also coming to the game in August.</p></div><div><p>Latias is joining the MOBA <em>Pokémon Unite</em> for its fourth anniversary. Latios joined the roster on July 18, with Latias to follow on August 8. A new battle mode called Electrode Volleyball is also now available in-game.</p></div><div><p>We saw some of the new full-art Mega Evolution cards coming to the Trading Card Game, including Lucario, Gardevoir, Kangaskhan and Venusaur.</p></div><div><p>Minutes before the Presents began, a new puzzle game called <em>Pokémon Friends </em>was released on the App Store. Someone flipped a switch too early, it seems. The game centers around collecting <em>Pokémon </em>plushies by solving short puzzles in a variety of classic, traditional brainteaser formats. The game is free-to-play on mobile and apparently a $9.99 package on Switch.</p></div><div><p>After a brief mention of the game’s Switch 2 upgrades, it was announced that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>are getting new tera raids for the Treasures of Ruin, but you’ll only be able to capture them after the raids have been completed one million times across all players.</p></div><div><p>We finally saw our first footage of <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The battle simulator includes ranked play, private battles, and a new training mode that lets you alter monster stats and move pools, and really craft your team. It’s coming to Switch and mobile in 2026.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show is a new look at <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. We started with a pretty slick trailer showing the main character running around the city, meeting new characters, and trying on new clothes, with their Pokémon following them around the whole time. The presentation focused on the story, cast, and what you can do in the moment-to-moment, but it also revealed one new Mega Evolution: Dragonite, which brings back some of the visual elements of its previous evolution, Dragonair, such as wings on its head and a pearl on its tail. And that was it. Alrighty then. The game looks really cool and there’s some exciting stuff here, but I was hoping for a more substantial blow-out on the rumored Mega Evolutions. Maybe they just want to keep those under wraps until the game comes out on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682]]></content:encoded>
