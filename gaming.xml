			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due out in a little less than a month from the time of this writing, as it'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 19, 2025. As part of the road to launch, developer Techland has debuted a new trailer, and more interestingly, shown off some behind-the-scenes concept art, and gone into detail about the team's design intentions with multiple elements of the game in a <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him">new developer blog</a>.</p>



<p>Techland delves into Kyle Crane's return, and the artistic direction behind what he looks like now after a decade of imprisonment, and how to tell the story of his time in captivity without the player being able to constantly look at his face in what Techland refers to as an FPP game (first-person parkour). Kyle's arms, then, were given great focus.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Part 1: Torture &amp; Suffering" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mB56AIZV3Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>In an FPP game, it’s difficult to convey the appearance of a character, since one of the few elements visible are the hero’s hands. That’s why we put a lot of effort into the details here. A special shoutout to Charidimos Bitsakakis, who, accompanied by other artists, spent countless hours perfecting them. We recreated Kyle’s hands from the first game, but added scars and other marks reflecting the torture he endured in the Baron’s lab. The experiments also gave rise to the Beast Mode, which we wanted to be visible in FPP as well - we looked for a visual language to represent his transformation and decided on black veins, dark and menacing, perfectly reflecting Kyle’s nature and what he sees when he becomes the Beast.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>The blog also digs into the ways Techland looked to evolve gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast through tweaking and adjusting Kyle's animations, that they should both "<em>be inspired by DL1 Kyle - reflecting his muscle memory, personality, and fighting style</em>," and have "<em>a clear contrast between Kyle in the beast mode - brutal, uncontrolled, overconfident - and Kyle outside of it - pragmatic, precise, and confident</em>."</p>



<p>It's alltogether great dive into Kyle Crane and Dying Light: The Beast for fans who are eagerly anticipating the game's release next month.</p>



<p>When Wccftech checked out Dying Light: The Beast in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/">a preview earlier this year</a>, Kai Tatsumoto found that Crane had indeed been turned into a beast, saying it was the one "<em>certain</em>" thing about the game, even after only checking out an early portion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new pair of third-party books is available for pre-order on D&amp;D Beyond. The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> brings a revised version of Ghostfire Games' dark fantasy world of Etharis to the platform. Notably, it is the first third-party book to use the new 2024 ruleset.</p>

<h2>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024</em> Bundle Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/CBGCH9A2W" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> will contain two books: the <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> and the <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-monster-hunter-artwork.jpg?itok=MJkkjUC9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-monster-hunter-artwork.jpg?itok=juzsUltN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Importantly, these books contain updated rules and mechanics from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024. This is not to be confused with the <em>Grim Hollow: Player Pack</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/two-ghostfire-gaming-adventures-are-now-available-to-purchase-on-dd-beyond-continues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lairs of Etharis</em></a> material, which were designed with the 2014 rules in mind. If you already own this material, it is still compatible with this new edition.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is packed with material for players who want to add darker themes and horror to their <em>D&amp;D</em> game. This includes 21 new player species, 40 new subclasses, 25 backgrounds, 41 feats, 102 new spells, 113 dark fantasy-themed magic items, and 82 advanced weapons. The <em>Player Guide</em> even includes a new character class: the Monster Hunter.:</p>

<p>For GMs, there is plenty to enjoy as well. There are 24 monsters, 10 detailed battlemaps, in-depth lore of the seven different regions of the land of Etharis, and grittier rules for resting, wounds, and corruption. Will your adventurers resist, or fall into murky moral greys?</p>

<p>The corruption isn't metaphorical either. The unique selling point of <em>Grim Hollow</em> are rules where players can slowly become monsters, including vampires, werewolves, demons, liches, avenging angels, and more.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $69.99. The <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> is available now and can be bought separately for $39.99. The <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em> will be available on the platform on September 30.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kevin-spacey-was-%E2%80%98a-little-weird%E2%80%99-while-making-cod-advanced-warfare-director-claims.1283481/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 2014, before allegations of sexual misconduct against him became public, actor Kevin Spacey was one of the biggest names out there thanks to Netflix’s <em>House of Cards</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-spacey-the-kotaku-review-1654032299">And his role in that year’s<em> Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em></a> was a highlight. But now, it feels like a problematic relic. However, the game’s director, Glen Schofield, doesn’t think the shooter is “tainted,” even if Spacey was “weird” to work with.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/kevin-spacey-got-a-little-weird-on-the-set-of-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-we-all-had-to-fake-laugh/">In an interview with<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Glen Schofield was asked about Spacey’s involvement in<a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026/20"><em> Advanced Warfare</em> as the shooter’s main villain</a>. In 2014, Spacey delivered a fantastic performance that was praised by many critics and fans. In 2017, his role in the game became less celebrated after accusations of sexual harassment and assault were levied against the actor. While years later, he was ultimately not found liable for harassment and was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/uk/kevin-spacey-trial-jury-verdict-intl/index.html">acquitted of assault</a>, Spacey’s reputation was still heavily damaged, and he appeared in fewer film and TV roles. Despite that, Schofield told the outlet that Spacey’s inclusion “doesn’t taint the game.”</p> <p>“At the time, that’s the actor I wanted,” said Schofield.&nbsp;“When he was on set, and we said action, he was unbelievable. He just is a great actor, right? Then when we said cut, you could tell the video games weren’t his thing. We had to get him a trailer. So he had a trailer outside that he would go in and he was a little bit more difficult, I would say.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="et" dir="ltr">On set filming <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdvancedWarfare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AdvancedWarfare</a>! <a href="http://t.co/2Q0jZPkiwT">pic.twitter.com/2Q0jZPkiwT</a></p> <p>— Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/464570512510042112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Advanced Warfare’</em>s director did claim that Spacey “got a little weird once in a while on the set.” Schofield added, “He would say things that just weren’t proper. We all had to fake laugh. There was some stuff.”</p> <p>Schofield explained that the initial pitch for <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2</em> involved Spacey’s character returning in some form despite dying in the previous game. However, Activision passed on that pitch, which he’s grateful for now.</p> <p>“We were going to go there,” Schofield admitted, “and I’m glad we didn’t, because it was like two months before we would have shipped when the scandal broke.”</p>

While previously, Nightreign's ongoing challenging endgame content has been limited to more difficult bosses, Deep of Night will impact an entire run, from start to finish.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, enemies will just be stronger than normal across the board. You also won't get a heads up about which Nightlord you'll be fighting, nor will you know if you're getting a Shifting Earth event in advance, so you won't be able to prep a build for any specific type of run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, to counterbalance this, players will be able to collect new types of weapons and relics with even more powerful effects...though they may also have some new drawbacks attached as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you play and win Deep of Night you will descend to deeper depth levels, going at least as far as Depth 5. Each new Depth gets even more challenging, though losses will push you back up to easier Depths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-say-theyve-uncovered-an-entirely-new-ultra-hard-game-mode">This mode was previously datamined</a>, with dataminers getting all the announced details correct. Not announced but suggested by the datamine is that Deep of Night will feature skill-based matchmaking, and that some enemies will get special additional effects, such as being "magmafied," or covered in magma. The datamine also suggests that players can unlock access to three additional relic slots for Deep of Night only, giving them up to a total of six.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10</a>, saying "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." The game recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">a much-requested duos mode</a>, and currently has two Everdark Sovereign bosses available for players wanting a challenge before Deep of Night: Libra, and Caligo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Sucker Punch Productions announced <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1961111668345241612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that their upcoming game Ghost of Yōtei has officially gone gold. This means the game is fully completed and has been sent to be mastered for physical copies, although of course, these days a studio's work is never done. Sucker Punch will still likely continue up to the last minute for the day-one patch, and even beyond that. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know</a> that Ghost of Yōtei, like its predecessor, will receive a 'Legends' multiplayer mode in 2026, free for all owners of the game.</p>



<p>A spiritual successor to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima, the new game is however set in a different place, at a different time, and with a different protagonist. In this one, players will step into the role of Atsu, who at the beginning of the game is nearly killed alongside her family by the so-called Yōtei Six, led by the renegade samurai Lord Saitō and consisting of the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, and the Dragon. Sixteen years later, Atsu roams the surroundings of the titular Mount Yōtei to exact bloody vengeance on the aforementioned group.</p>



<p>New features compared to Ghost of Tsushima include dynamic weather effects, such as snow, rain, and auroras, inspired by the real-life environment surrounding Mount Yōtei. Additionally, Sucker Punch has <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's flexible, nonlinear quest structure allows players to choose the order in which they confront the Yōtei Six, fostering emergent narrative paths and player-driven momentum. Similar to the first game, players can take on side missions, such as hunting outlaws for bounty rewards. Several side activities also return, including bathing in an onsen and cutting bamboo, as well as new activities such as sumi-e painting and setting up a campsite where Atsu can cook and play her shamisen.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">map size</a> are said to be similar to the previous entry, though the developers also said that the game world will feel larger, owing to the real environments. Ghost of Yōtei will be released on October 2 for PlayStation 5, with a PC version practically assured to follow in about a year or so, given Sony's recent policy.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14s-yoshi-p-weighs-in-on-mods-after-popular-custom-character-sharing-mod-shuts-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-14s-yoshi-p-weighs-in-on-mods-after-popular-custom-character-sharing-mod-shuts-down.1283439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14's community is once again in a tizzy about the use of mods in game, to the point where the game's producer and director, Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P), <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has weighed in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. While modding is an extremely common practice across many games, including other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 has always had a slightly more hostile relationship with them. That's not to say players don't use mods in FF14 - they absolutely do. But officially, they're not allowed. Even so, Square Enix has largely operated for a long time on a policy of letting mods slide...as long as players aren't too loud or obvious about it. So players might use mods to customize their UIs, or change the way their character looks just on their own screen. As long as they aren't interfering with other people's games or, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14s-latest-raid-sparks-controversy-as-world-first-winners-accused-of-cheating">being very public about their mod use</a>, the publisher has mostly turned a blind eye.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that strategy hasn't always worked out for Square Enix, especially due to the lack of real clarity for players as to what Square Enix will be permissive about, versus what it will immediately ban. And recently, mods have been in the crosshairs of the developer once again. Earlier this year, Yoshi-P himself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod">threatened legal action</a> after a mod went around that could track other people's player data - a mod that's pretty obviously not permitted by any standards. But more recently, a different, less obviously problematic mod has entered the discourse: Mare Synchronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mare Synchronos is a mod that's become popular with Final Fantasy 14 players over the years, especially for role-playing communities. Essentially, it lets those who use it "synchronize" their character appearances with those of other players. Here's an example. If I'm playing FF14 and don't have a lot of cool gear to dress my character up in, and don't want to run the content needed to acquire it for whatever reason, I can use a mod that will let my character appear exactly how I want them to - but only on my screen. However, with Mare Synchronos, everyone else using Mare Synchronos can <em>also</em> see that modded appearance. Players who do not use the mod will see my character in whatever bland gear I'm actually wearing. And critically, Mare doesn't actually let you change your character's appearance - other mods are needed for that. Mare just lets you see other mods, and be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, a week ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1mwhuzu/final_fantasy_xiv_mod_mare_synchronos_is_shutting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mare Synchronos announced it was shutting down</a>. The cited reason was that it had received a "legal inquiry" surrounding the project, and after reviewing options, the creator decided to wind it down. It officially went dark last Friday. While some fans were unphased by the shutdown, or even claimed they'd expected it eventually, many others were deeply upset. Though Mare's developer hadn't specified who the legal inquiry was from, many speculating it was likely Square Enix, and even took to the FF14 official forums to complain about the third-party mod shutting down. It's even getting review bombed on Steam right now, currently sitting at "Mixed" recent reviews versus "Very Positive" total reviews.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is what has prompted Yoshi-P to speak up. In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy post on the official Final Fantasy 14 website</a>, the producer reiterated his past-stated stance on mods: he tolerates them. That stance, he says, hasn't changed. Mods made entirely for one's own personal use that only impact the individual using them, Yoshi-P explains, are fine with him. "I'd like to stress the importance that players follow two rules: that their style of gameplay does not infringe upon others, and that they do not negatively impact the core game, its services, or intended game design, as mentioned above."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P goes on to detail exactly what he means by "negative impacting the intended game design" and "infringing upon others." He offers an example of a player, Player A, who loves to raid and acquires a new title and weapon by successfully finishing an Ultimate raid. Player B does not have time to raid, and uses a mod that allows them to see their character with the same title and weapon as Player A. As long as that only displays on Player B's screen, that's not a problem for Yoshi-P.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, where Yoshi-P takes issue is when this begins to impact others. If Player B's changes are visible to Player A somehow, "it considerably negates the cooperation, time, and effort invested, not to mention the pride they might have felt in their achievement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He goes on to illustrate another example that is unacceptable: a mod that allows players to freely equip optional items purchased from the FF14 Online Store and display them to others:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some may say that Square Enix is to blame for trying to make money by demanding that players spend extra on optional items," he writes. "We operate our servers and data centers twenty-four hours a day, three-hundred-sixty-five days a year with the hope that our players can enjoy a reliable gaming experience. Currently, global inflation is taking its toll at a rapid pace, driving up server electricity costs, the cost of land, and even the price of servers themselves. We do not want to increase subscription fees for players, if at all possible─but keeping our game running requires sufficient income. If we start creating a deficit, FFXIV may no longer be able to operate. This is an example of damage dealt to the services we provide."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a third example, Yoshi-P mentions the possibility of a mod that displays a character completely naked. Even if this is only displayed on the player's screen, he explains how it could potentially still be harmful. For instance, if a player posts a screenshot of their naked character on social media, FF14 may face legal consequences.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Laws that regulate the content of video games grow stricter by the year," he says. "These laws are there to protect minors and for a variety of other reasons, but the fact remains that they are tangibly becoming stricter. We have a duty to provide our services in adherence to the laws of all countries where FFXIV is available, and if we are unable to do so, the distribution of our game can be prohibited. This is another example of damage dealt to our services."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P ends his post by saying he intends to listen to player feedback and try to increase the freedom of players to equip different types of gear. "While paying respect to the long-standing tradition of modding PC games, I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules," he concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this post contains some much-needed clarification, it ultimately does leave Final Fantasy 14 in the same odd limbo state it's always been in: no mods allowed, except it's fine if no one ever knows you're using them. While that will likely be sufficient clarification for many players, it's still a potentially frustrating place for players who have built their gameplay styles around the modding community and what it has to offer. At least over on console, no one has anything to worry about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> dropped a bunch of new collabs in quick succession this week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-gorillaz-season-in-fortnite-festival/1100-6534219/" data-ref-id="1100-6534219">Gorillaz</a>, the Front Man from Squid Game, and the One Punch Man cosmetics on Tuesday and Wednesday. But apparently Epic isn't done with this week just yet, because the Fortnite Instagram account just teased a new skin based on a space dwarf from the co-op shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558483" data-ratio="0.56245662734212" data-width="2882" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558483"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite Instagram posted a story teasing the Deep Rock Galactic collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg"></figure><p>The countdown timer indicates this six-foot-tall dwarf skin will hit the Fortnite item shop on Friday at the usual shop reset time at 5 PM PT. It'll likely have some accessories that come with it, like a pickaxe, back bling, and wrap--though that's not always the case with individual gaming skins like this. The Goat from Goat Simulator, for example, never received any accessories, and Goat Simulator and Deep Rock Galactic share the same publisher. The image above is the entire tease, and so there's no way to tell what else, if anything, might come with it.</p><p>This is a rare example of Fortnite collaborating with another video game that isn't available on the Epic Games Store. It's not something that happens a lot, but it's not particularly shocking either, since Halo just got a slot on the current battle pass despite also not being on EGS.</p><p>Deep Rock Galactic, released in early access on PC and Xbox in 2018 before getting a full release in 2020, is a co-op shooter in which players control their own custom fantasy-style dwarf as they try to mine valuable resources in procedurally generated cave systems on a hostile alien planet. This collaboration is likely pegged to the new spinoff game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-583534">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a>, a chaotic top-down shooter which exits early access in September.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We're a few weeks removed from the Battlefield 6 open beta, and by all accounts, the test was a massive success. While it was live, the beta <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-open-beta-outpaced-grand-theft-auto-5-on-ps5-and-xbox/2900-6921/#1">topped the Steam charts</a> while also placing highly on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5's active-user leaderboards. Once it was over, its absence (and some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-get-all-free-battlefield-6-skins-and-rewards-in-battlefield-2042/2900-6887/">freebies</a>) prompted a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-prompted-a-huge-spike-in-battlefield-2042-players-for-an-obvious-reason/1100-6534270/">huge spike in sales</a> of its predecessor, Battlefield 2042. The vibes around Battlefield haven't been this good in a while, thanks to that beta.</p><p dir="ltr">Feedback has been coming in quickly since the beta ended, with many fans taking to social media and forums to talk about what they most liked and disliked about this new Battlefield experience. However, there's one particular reaction that I find fascinating, and that's players being happy about the lack of collaborations with outside IP.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544116" data-ratio="0.56140350877193" data-width="1197" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544116"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Forniteification," as some call it, has turned other franchises into interactive IP catalogues, tapping into current trends and nostalgic trips to yesteryear in order to sell skins and other cosmetics. Battlefield's biggest competitor, Call of Duty, has embraced the concept, enlisting a range of established faces from WWE wrestlers to Cheech and Chong to Nicki Minaj into its platoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/">acknowledged fans' criticism</a> that the series has "drifted" from its identity, but I don't know if the company can fully close Pandora's box at this point. Activision may not think so, either: The news that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Black Ops 6 skins will not carry over to Black Ops 7</a> notably does not include the battle royale Warzone, where wacky skins will continue to exist--Activision may be trying to find a way to get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, we can't use the term "Fortniteification" without mentioning its namesake, as Fortnite is currently enjoying a season headlined by the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Name a popular IP across movies, TV, video games, or even music thanks to Fortnite Festival, and there's a chance it's been a part of Fortnite at some point. Fortnite's cartoony style may have immunized it from similar criticism, though; for "military simulations" like CoD and Battlefield, there are expectations of realism that fans aren't always willing to compromise on.</p><p dir="ltr">The devs behind Battlefield 6, to their credit, are talking the talk so far; Vince Zampella recently spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, where he said that BF6 will "stay true to Battlefield" with cosmetics that stick to what the article calls the "core visual identity of Battlefield." Online forums like Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1mf53ev/battlefield_6_leads_will_avoid_goofy_crossover/" rel="nofollow">seem to be happy</a> with this, with one commenter saying they hope this declaration is "not an empty promise."</p><p dir="ltr">Look, I appreciate those who want Battlefield to be as "authentic" an experience as possible for its fans--whatever that even means. However, it would be completely naive to think that Battlefield won't try its hand at the collaboration game, simply because Electronic Arts likes money and wants to earn as much of it as possible. The main reason those wacky Call of Duty skins appear in the game in the first place is because Activision knows people will buy them, and EA would be silly to leave those potential dollars on the table.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558499" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558499"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty's recent Beavis and Butthead collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Please don't misunderstand me: I am not saying that a Battlefield where Ronald McDonald and the Burger King finally settle their score is inevitable (though if Fortnite wanted to take on this hypothetical…). What I am saying, though, is that expecting Battlefield 6 to maintain this lack of collaboration throughout its life cycle is setting yourself up for disappointment, because there's simply too much money to be made in those partnerships.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, there are ways to make the inevitable collaborations with outside IP blend in seamlessly with Battlefield's look and feel; namely, choose partners that are a natural fit for a military simulation sort of game. They're out there, and I'm willing to bet the IP owners would be thrilled to join Battlefield 6 if the game mirrors the success it saw in open beta when it fully launches in October.</p><p dir="ltr">Take <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, for example. This one doesn't have to go too far--armor skins, perhaps a weapon or two--but the defenders of democracy in Helldivers 2 would make a nice fit into Battlefield 6, even with their futuristic look. Another one that sticks out to me is <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong>, as I'm sure many Battlefield players who are also MGS fans would love being able to have the official Foxhound logo, or Snake's bandana, or any of Big Boss's many camouflage patterns from MGS 3 on their character. Let's not forget that Battlefield 2042 included <strong>Mass Effect</strong> and <strong>Dead Space</strong> collabs, so EA could always dip into that well again too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's fertile ground for partnerships outside of video game IP as well. <strong>Reacher</strong> on Amazon Prime comes to mind; if Alan Ritchson wanted to record some lines and lend his likeness to a Battlefield version of Jack Reacher, that would fit nicely. EA could even go for a nostalgia hit with another fictional Jack in <strong>24</strong>'s Bauer, especially if Kiefer Sutherland would lend his voice and likeness as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These are off-the-cuff ideas, but the overall theme remains consistent; with some restraint, Battlefield 6 could jump into the Scrooge McDuck money bin that is outside IP collaboration, but do it in a way that "stays true to Battlefield" as Zampella suggests is the plan. Partnering with other IP owners doesn't mean you immediately have to throw Pennywise the Clown into your game; by being selective, EA has an opportunity to walk the fine line and get outside IPs into Battlefield 6 without driving it into becoming a parody of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I just hope the BF6 teams at DICE and the other studios can figure it out, because if I had to guess, the challenge is going to come to them eventually. There's simply too much money to be made for EA to ignore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another massive batch of developers under Microsoft and more specifically under Blizzard have voted in favor of unionization under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), as 450 developers working on Diablo voted for unionization.</p>



<p>Per a press release from the CWA, those who voted for unionizing will join members of the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, the CWA Local 1118 in Albany, and the CWA Local 6215 in Austin. Microsoft, in keeping with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">promise made to help push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through</a>, has recognized the union. </p>



<p>That's not to say that Microsoft has been entirely welcoming to the hundreds of game developers under it that have unionized in recent years. It took the ZeniMax QA union, the first major union to form under Microsoft thanks to the deal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">two years to reach a deal</a>, and they eventually had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">strike</a> to help get its deal through. </p>



<p>There are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">other unions</a> under Microsoft working for a deal, but still, it's all a step towards creating a better situation for the developers.</p>



<p>"<em>With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us</em>," said Kelly Yeo, producer on Diablo. "<em>I am overjoyed that we have formed a union—this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues.</em>"</p>



<p>Nav Bhatti, senior software engineer on Diablo added, "<em>My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love</em>. <em>At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that — standing our ground in the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>This is the latest wall-to-wall unionization effort at Blizzard since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch 2 team </a>formed its union, and if the reports we've heard, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-king-layoffs-chaos-microsoft-mandatory-daily-ai-use/">continue to hear</a>, about working conditions under Microsoft are even half true, it likely won't be the last as workers continue to fight for a better quality of life. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The undead hordes are back in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>,&nbsp;</em>but they aren’t hanging out in a snowy cemetery like in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-north-yankton-halloween-survival-1851664429">last year’s Halloween event</a>. Instead, zombies have infested the tropical island of Cayo Perico in a new mode that’s bigger and trippier than the last zombie survival mode.</p> <p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3k38k52o5383/battle-hordes-of-undead-in-the-new-cayo-perico-survival?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=465:cayo-perico-zombie-survival-20250828">On August 28, Rockstar Games officially announced</a> (and then promptly added) a new zombie survival mode to <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>Titled “Cayo Perico Zombie Survival,” this new mode transports players to the already existing tropical island of Cayo Perico to fight off waves of zombies. During the mode, which can be played solo or with three of your friends, players will encounter a wide array of undead foes, including DJ zombies and undead conquistadors. Remember when this was a gritty online crime simulator set in the same universe as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>? Anyway, here’s the trailer for the new mode:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battle Undead in the New GTA Online Cayo Perico Survival" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbuCIrZSPDk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Compared to last year’s Halloween zombies mode, this new Cayo Perico Zombie Survival is much bigger and wilder. Last year’s mode was set in one small snowy cemetery, featured a handful of zombie types, and that was it. This new mode features more enemy variety, moves players around the island to fight the undead in different spots, and just seems like a weirder and bigger thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-mode-ludendorff-cemetery-survival-1851672030">I guess last year’s zombie event being a massive success</a> convinced Rockstar Games to invest more money and resources into this new undead survival mode. It sounds like this mode will be leaving on September 10, so don’t wait too long to hop back into <em>GTA Online,</em> earn some new exclusive rewards, and kill a bunch of zombies.</p> <p>Here’s Rockstar’s official description of the mode:</p> <blockquote><p>Your favorite island paradise just came down with a deadly case of party fever. As if a major narcotrafficking island wasn’t dangerous enough, it’s now been overrun by the undead — and maybe it’s the drugs or the tropical climate, but this time they’ve got a whole lot weirder. Cut your way through waves of undead, including conquistadors armed with muskets, Panther Trainers and their feral pets, swarms of Splitters, and more in the new Cayo Perico Survival. Fight through these hordes and make your way to the airstrip — then pray your evacuation plane doesn’t take too long.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Solo developer Immersiv Games reached out to me back in June to check out its non-linear adventure game, Arcadian Days, during Steam Next Fest, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/06/13/the-25-best-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try">it ended up being one of my favorite demos from the event</a>. Now, Immersiv Games has revealed Arcadian Days hits Steam Early Access on September 16, and if you're looking for something relaxing and unique to check out, I'd recommend giving it a shot.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2L7IvxgwNo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2L7IvxgwNo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>During the Steam Next Fest demo, I was impressed by its minimalist, free-flowing exploration and sun-kissed visuals – throughout the demo, a gorgeous sunset created a painterly backdrop to my leisurely tasks, which included collecting plants for a crop or wood in a shed. The tasks I experienced weren't too challenging, and completing them took little effort, but Immersiv Games' self-proclaimed "non-linear" and "relaxing" makes me think this is by design. Though I love me some fast-paced, high-intensity action games, Arcadian Days' demo reminded me that it's equally as rewarding to check out a game that asks you to slow down and breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>I look forward to seeing how the Arcadian Days evolves during its Early Access period. Arcadian Days launches on PC via Steam Early Access on September 16.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, check out my Arcadian Days demo thoughts in this round-up <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/06/13/the-25-best-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/arcadian-days-a-relaxing-non-linear-adventure-hits-early-access-next-month]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from a brief stint in covid lockdown where I dumped several hundred dollars into <em>MTG: Arena</em>, got to mythic with a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/203/scute-swarm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scute swarm</a> deck and went cold turkey, I have been clean from <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> since <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Combo_Winter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mess around the Mirrodin block</a> in high school. But before then I was a regular tournament goer, spent a lot of time playing the game and still have my rare binder. I still keep up with what’s happening to <em>Magic</em> from a safe distance, far away from my wallet. That’s why I’m pleased that Vivi Ornitier from <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> is currently making the Standard format so miserable that they might have to ban the little guy. Buddy, I’m so proud of you.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SQUARE ENIX/Wizards of the Coast. Art: Toni Infante, Jason Engle </span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivi, the diminutive black mage, was introduced as part of the wildly popular <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/final-fantasy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy</em> set</a>, a part of <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Universes_Beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universes Beyond</a>. Universes Beyond is a sub-brand that focuses on lassoing IP from outside of the lore of the <em>Magic </em>universe (<em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>, etc.) into the main game. Often this consists of simple reprints and reskins of existing <em>Magic</em> cards, but <em>Final Fantasy</em> marked a turning point because it was a totally new set that was entirely legal to play in Standard. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> set has been obscenely popular, making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 million dollars in a single day</a>. It is a love letter to the series and a fantastic lure to new players, and one that did not feature too many overpowered cards. It was a gargantuan hit, and subsequent Universes Beyond sets coming up include <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/avatar-the-last-airbender/card-image-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/marvel/spider-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Spider-Man</em>.</a></p><p>On his own, Vivi starts off powerless and gets huge as time goes on. Every spell you cast that isn’t a creature makes him bigger with counters and pings all opponents for one damage. The more powerful he is (either through this ability or other means) the more red and blue mana you can add to your deck once per turn. Even without other synergies, he’s somewhat broken mechanically: bare minimum, Vivi’s ability should have been a tap ability to begin with. The part where it becomes a problem is with another card in Standard: Agatha’s Soul Cauldron.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="We Might Have a Vivi Problem" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/erRxQzM_S3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Agatha’s Soul Cauldron is a legendary artifact. The first effect is that it allows you to spend any color mana to activate creature abilities. This is nice, but not really that interesting in this context. Where it gets nasty is that it allows you to exile (remove from the game) creature cards in any graveyard (where they normally go when they die or are discarded from your hand) to share activated abilities with every creature with a +1/+1 token, as well as place a counter +1/+1 on a creature you own. This means that if you intentionally build a deck that puts Vivi in the graveyard, then remove him with the cauldron, all your characters with +1/+1 counters become Vivis: an increasing fountain of mana that scales with the creature. Also unlike Vivi, the creatures you’d be playing in that deck do not start off as a 0/3, and thus are more powerful with this combo. When it goes off, it potentially creates an increasing feedback loop that just creates more spells, more cards, and more mana. Even if the opponent does manage to get rid of the cauldron, they often have to deal with what it created. This deck is known as Izzet Cauldron, it is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1mzuwno/current_standard_state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dominating the standard format</a>, and currently costs like $700-$800 in physical cards.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Wizards Of The Coast. Art: John Stanko, Alix Brawyn, Zara Alfonso, Julie Dillon.</figcaption></figure><p>There are also other components to Izzet Cauldron that make it nasty. The spells in the deck tend to focus on graveyard abilities, tokens, and drawing and discarding cards to not only dump Vivi in the graveyard, but also find the combo. There’s <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/prices/marauding-mako" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marauding Mako</a>, a weenie that adds counters when you discard and can be discarded for a card. <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/prices/proft-s-eidetic-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proft’s Eidetic Memory</a> is an enchantment that adds counters to creatures based on how many cards you’ve drawn. <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/prices/fear-of-missing-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fear of Missing Out</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/127/tersa-lightshatter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tersa Lightshatterer</a> can occasionally have utility on their own with the Cauldron, although they are primarily there to dump Vivi or dump something in the hope of finding Vivi. And <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/67/winternight-stories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winternight Stories</a> lets you draw and discard cards and can be played from the graveyard for a higher cost. There’s enough here that makes the cauldron fun without Vivi, but Vivi is what makes the deck a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Should Vivi Ornitier Be Emergency Banned in Standard MTG?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8XuW3tiIN0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Izzet’s Cauldron is currently dominating the <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Standard game format</a>, which is composed of recent sets that get rotated out on a three-year cycle (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/revitalizing-standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although it used to be two years</a>). Standard is not the only format out there; Commander is way popular and frankly more fun, but it is a significant one. If you care about tournament play, which many players simply don’t, the question becomes if Izzet Cauldron will get so unsustainably dominant that it pushes out other decks from play, and if that’s a fun format to play in.</p><p>There’s multiple ways that <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Should-MTG-s-Vivi-Ornitier-Be-Emergency-Banned-in-Standard/c6cac280-dde2-4fef-bea4-89d5a0f70efa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wizards of the Coast could deal with this</a>. Normally bans are announced in specific and predictable timeframes. They could emergency ban the Cauldron in Standard, which would do something but not solve the fact that Vivi is wildly overpowered and would be kicking around until February 2028 (<a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/izzet-prowess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Izzet Prowess</a> decks would still be around and still be nasty). They could ban Vivi in Standard, in which case everyone who spent a lot of money on Vivi cards (currently going for like 40-55 bucks each as of this writing) would be pissed off, although I’d argue that if you bought Vivi knowing what was happening you factored that in as a possibility. They could just hang out and do nothing and hope the situation resolves itself. Or they could make some other weird attempt to fix it.</p><p>I don’t have a material stake in the current <em>Magic</em> meta: not my monkeys, not my circus. Wizards of the Coast also has no reason to listen to me, I didn’t make 200 million dollars in a day.&nbsp; But it’s a tremendously funny situation all around. As our good friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/esper.bsky.social/post/3lxdk34xst22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esper Quinn pointed out</a>, it’s appropriate that an $700-$800 deck containing a card named FOMO represents a big part of the current Standard meta. I also just adore Vivi as a character, and the mental image of players turning him into soup and making an army of Black Mages is thematically resonant with the source material – Vivi is an experiment who escaped containment and took on a life of his own.</p><p>Though I was thoroughly impressed by the care that went into the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set (it is clearly a labor of love) I do not think making the Universes Beyond brand tournament legal represented a healthy impulse. The <em>Fortnite</em>-ification of everything is often done cynically, and slamming all the various IPs you love together in an attempt to grow your player base is tiring. Though it is a funny mental image, I don’t want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis to kick the T1000 in the nads in Call of Dut</a>y, that just kinda bums me out. I would like games to have confidence in the worlds they create instead of feeling the need to borrow from other worlds. But if something has to break the game, I’m so glad it was the tiny, unassuming figure of Vivi, who’s just a little guy and never harmed anyone.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;[h/t Ashley Glenn for additional assistance]</strong></p><p><strong>UPDATE: Clarified the wording of the piece to reflect that Agatha's Soul Cauldron gives activated abilities to other creatures.</strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs"><h3>Diablo Devs Unionize Following Layoffs And Dissatisfaction With AI, Pay</h3></a><p>"It feels like every time [layoffs] happen, the noose tightens a little more for anybody left behind"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt"><h3>AI Can’t Suffer, But It Should Suffer For This</h3></a><p>It's the sentience of AI's creators that really matters</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him]]></content:encoded>

<p>On <strong>2</strong><strong>3rd November 2025 at 23:59</strong>, it will no longer be possible to buy the Nintendo-published game from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Fitness-Boxing-2-Rhythm-Exercise-1843189.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=FitnessBoxing|NULL|ProductDiscontinuation|m_id_2tBvHJYJ48|1843189">digital storefront</a>.

<p>At the time of writing, this has only been confirmed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">by Nintendo UK on X</a>, but we imagine other regions will follow suit. No reason has been given for the removal, but fans speculate that it's due to the licenses for some in-game music running out.</p>

<p>Presumably, Fitness Boxing 3 is safe for now, but given that this has happened with the first two games, it wouldn't be surprising if 3 was removed later down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Elder Scrolls Online team has had to go through a lot of changes lately. Earlier this year, the studio announced a change to the way new content for the eleven-year-old MMORPG would be released. Previously, ZeniMax Online Studios used to launch expansions (called Chapters), but now they have <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to a seasonal model</a> that began this June with <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season of the Worm Cult</a>. </p>



<p>The studio itself has gone through a leadership change. Following the departure of founder Matt Firor, Jo Burba has stepped up as the new Studio Director, and now Elder Scrolls Online Game Director Rich Lambert has moved into the new role of Studio Game Director while Nick Giacomini is taking his place. I discussed all this, the state of the game, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancellation of ZeniMax Online's other project</a> in a chat with Rich Lambert and Nick Giacomini at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Rich, what's going on at ZeniMax Online Studios? Tell us about it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> There's lots of change in the air. I am moving up a role, so I am going to focus more on studio-level things, and Nick is coming in and taking over the game direction. It's something that I'm really excited about. I've been working on ESO for 18 years now. It's amazing and super fun, but I'm ready to try new things and spread my wings. Nick is the right person to do that and help take Elder Scrolls Online, with the team, to new heights.</p>



<p><strong>Your role is still distinct from that of Studio Director, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> I'm the Studio Game Director and will focus more on studio-level initiatives, future projects, and things like that. I'll still be working with Nick, who is going to be 100% devoted to ESO on a day-to-day basis.</p>



<p><strong>Nick, do you want to introduce yourself and talk about what you've done before?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> I'm a huge gamer, have been my entire life. MMOs are my favorite genre by far. I've been playing Elder Scrolls Online since day one. I had just built a new computer to play the game. And in 2019, when I got the job at ZOS, I was literally jumping up and down in joy. I've been on this incredible journey since then, getting to work with incredibly talented people to create this game and continue to update and provide the experiences our players love. I joined as a Senior Product Manager and then became Project Director. I got to work very closely with Rich throughout the entirety of this time, and I've got the work with many different teams on multiple features. Stepping into this leadership role is just such an honor. </p>



<p><strong>What's your vision for the game now that you took the reins from Rich?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Rich and I share a lot. I actually love the community. When we talk about what makes Elder Scrolls Online great, by far the most important things are the players. The players are so central to the decision-making. That's, like, the first thing, doubling down on communicating with our players and being more transparent. We must do right by them and provide the experiences and stories that make ESO great. Passion and excitement are another thing. We have a lot of very passionate developers. This has never been about a single person. We are a large team of very talented developers and I want that passion to shine through. We get excited and we play the game too. </p>



<p>Another part related to that is evolution, right? So, 10 years, 11 years now, it's great that Elder Scrolls Online has been successful for so long, and we want to honor those roots. But at the same time, the expectation has changed. We've got feedback that the game has been too predictable, so another thing is how can we provide things that are more exciting? The players are choosing to invest their most precious thing, their free time, in our game, while there's so many games, there's other forms of entertainment, so why should they spend time in this game? I'm a strong believer that every second that players spend in Elder Scrolls Online should be valuable and rewarding.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>I don't think that 30 years is some insurmountable challenge, but it's also just not going to be easy. I believe we do have a core, and that's one of the wonderful things about MMOs: we have a core of very passionate players who have been playing for a long time. I think the path to 30 years lies there. That's one of the reasons we're moving to a seasonal model. Player feedback has always been a critical component of the development process, but we are now doubling down on that, and I think this is the best possible way to get to 30 years.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I was reading the <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> that went up recently, and the Studio Director (Jo Burba) said that ZeniMax Online Studios wants this to be a thirty-year-old game. What do you think you'll have to do to achieve that? Keep doing what you're doing at your best, or is there more to it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Eleven years is already a pretty incredible accomplishment. Like I said earlier in the conversation, it very much has to do with the players, right? I don't think that 30 years is some insurmountable challenge, but it's also just not going to be easy. I believe we do have a core, and that's one of the wonderful things about MMOs: we have a core of very passionate players who have been playing for a long time.</p>



<p>I think the path to 30 years lies there. That's one of the reasons we're moving to a seasonal model. Player feedback has always been a critical component of the development process, but we are now doubling down on that, and I think this is the best possible way to get to 30 years. That's not a roadmap but a perception of the mindset we're trying to impress: that we want to do right by the players.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> The players are changing, evolving, and growing, and we need to do the same. Players have said we have been a little formulaic, so we have done something different, and I think we've shown over the years that we are not afraid to make big changes and do crazy things sometimes, in order to make the game into what players are asking for. That's more of the mindset that we have right now.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that one of the big news this year in Elder Scrolls Online was the switch to a seasonal model. How is it going for you? What was the reaction of the fans compared to the Chapter model?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> It's hard because we're still in that transitional period. We knew it was going to be a little confusing because it takes a while to build the things we wanted to build, but overall, I think it's pretty cool and positive. I think players are starting to see some of the things that we talked about in the global reveal, which is that we want to iterate, change, experiment, and do different things.</p>



<p>We updated the new player experience, and we updated the returning player experience. We are doing the Writhing Wall; it was a completely new style of event for us. I think they're starting to see those things, and I think they're starting to understand and sort of gain that trust that, yeah, this might be the right way. Sure, there's some detractors right now, but I think as the year rolls on, as the next year comes in, they're going to start to see more and more of that. And I think it's going to start to make a lot more sense.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> I think it's a step in the right direction. Again, we're in a time of transition and change. That feedback is going to be critical. Part of the philosophy change is that it prevents us from getting locked into this extremely long development cycle, so we have more opportunities to try things to engage. I think this is very much a transitional year. By the next year, players are going to see more change and understand it better.</p>



<p><strong>You decided to focus more on system-driven updates maybe last year or a couple of years ago. Will that direction continue?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> I think so. One of the things that the focus on the systemic stuff does is it gives more opportunities for replayability, right? It's less one-shot, one-and-done type things, but a lot of that, too, is going to depend. If players love that stuff, we'll do more of it; if they say no, we want more of this stuff, we will try to do more of that stuff, and that's the whole point. As Nick said, building Chapters used to take us 18-ish months, so we were committed for 18 months and when players wanted some change, they had to wait until we finished that Chapter. In this new model, we have a number of smaller teams that are a little bit more agile and can go through and do things a little bit quicker.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Generally speaking, I agree with that, and we're trying to do more of that. We characterize it as systemic, but it's also just a more unified experience for our players. We have a lot of different teams with a lot of different ideas and we can bring everything together into something that is holistic and turns into a great experience for our players.</p>



<p><strong>More specifically, for example, will the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-devs-discuss-update-40s-endless-archive-infinite-dungeon-like-experience-and-its-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinite Archive</a> still be expanded upon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> We'll see, but we just added in the rerolling of Visions. That was a big piece of feedback there because players previously felt that it was too reliant on RNG, so now we have implemented a system that allows you to use the currency you earn while doing Infinite Archive to reroll those Visions to try to get the ones you're hunting for, and so far, it's been pretty well received.</p>



<p><strong>Another big system you added last year to Elder Scrolls Online was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scribing</a>. Is that one of those you will be updating, maybe with new skills and/or modifiers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> I think it's an avenue that we can go in. We did just give access to it to everybody, so now we've got a much wider pool of people to go in and explore the system and play with it. We'll see how that goes. If the players want us to keep working on Scribing, we'll do that; if they want us to do something else, again, we'll do something else.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> It's hard, and we're not ready to talk about specifics happening in 2026. But ESO has so many different types of players who engage in different systems, be it housing, Tribute, or PvP. That's always a balancing act since we have limited resources ourselves, and we try to apply those resources in the best way possible to provide something for all these different players. But the two specific examples you mentioned are absolutely on the table.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>I think it's a valid point of view that players are bringing up right now, feeling that in order to be competitive, they have to choose certain things. It's something that we've actually talked about quite a lot since the feature has been released and we have a lot of plans. It's too early to provide specifics, but this is something that we hear loud and clear from our community, and it's something we're going to try and address to make more builds viable for those who want to optimize.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>This year, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-subclassing-qa-power-level-will-go-up-some-but-were-fine-where-it-is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> multiclassing, or subclassing, to the game. I recently came back to Elder Scrolls Online after a period of not playing, and there's a lot of talk in the community about the Arcanist being a necessary part of the meta for DPS characters. Are you going to make any changes in that regard?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> We're looking at all of that stuff. The whole meta discussion is a very interesting and kind of detailed thought process. The meta is really what somebody says it is. Yes, it is one of the optimal ways. There's other ways to do it. But you also don't need to have that crazy level of optimization in order to do anything in the game. I get that players love to optimize everything. I do a lot of that too, as a player, right? I want to be as efficient as possible. I want to be as powerful as I can be. It's just this really interesting, nuanced discussion, but it is one of those things that we are looking at because we see that feedback, frankly. 'You have to be an Arcanist with Templar and Nightblade, that's the only way to play.'</p>



<p>It's not the only way to play. One of the things that I pride myself on as a player is like, what can I do that's off meta, that's different? I played a Stamina Templar before it was decent, right, and I was able to complete those things and do all the content in the game. But there are some outliers, things we're looking to change. This is probably the best way to say it. </p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yeah, we're talking about it. Subclassing is a really new system, like Rich said, and it caused players to be very creative. I have been playing an elementalist build right now, which is a fantasy that I want for my main character, and it's really fun. It is fantastic. We're seeing some really cool combinations that the players are using, and it's fun and it provides a freedom for players to play the way they want, which is something that's very important to us. But absolutely, I think it's a valid point of view that players are bringing up right now, feeling that in order to be competitive, they have to choose certain things. It's something that we've actually talked about quite a lot since the feature has been released and we have a lot of plans. It's too early to provide specifics, but this is something that we hear loud and clear from our community, and it's something we're going to try and address to make more builds viable for those who want to optimize.</p>



<p><strong>Personally, I think subclassing is a great addition in general. With regular classes, in most builds, you didn't really use one of the class skill lines, so that wasn't very useful for the player. Subclassing opens up a lot more options, though there's is definitely some fine-tuning to do. But it is also understandable since it's a new system.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> The other thing that's really hard to communicate to the community as a whole is that we have to look at everything, all the data, all the things that players are doing and not just a small group. When you're making balance changes, it's not for the 0.1% of the player base, it's like, what is going to be the most effective use of our time, and improve the lives of as many players as possible when they're doing that stuff. That's where some of the nuance comes in. Maybe one group over here is saying do this thing, and another group is saying please don't do that. It's really hard to please everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, everyone can choose to do whatever they want, stick with one class, or use subclassing in whatever combination available, but as a philosophy, in Elder Scrolls Online, to be competitive for PvE Trials, is it your vision that you have to subclass, or would you want players to be able to stay with just one class?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> You can stay with one class. Yes, you are more powerful when you multiclass. I think that's one of the things that we're looking at for a number of supplies, but like I said, there's nothing in the game that requires you to have that level of optimization.</p>



<p>Even for the no-death, speedrun, those kinds of things, you don't need to be that optimized. You need to be very coordinated. That's one of the reasons why we started doing the streamer Trials that we do with the communities, just to show that, yeah, you can put a ragtag team, a bunch of people together who may or may not be a little inebriated, and have fun in there and complete Veteran content.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Philosophically, we want as many builds to be as viable as possible, and for players to experience the fantasy they want and still be viable to do things. We think we can do better, and we're trying to do better. I'm sure you can imagine it's complicated and it's going to take time, but absolutely, that point of view is extremely valid. Nobody wants their build that they love to be not good compared to these others and feel like they're being penalized for not doing otherwise. Our goal is, like I said, to try to make as many builds as possible, as viable as possible. But that's going to take time; it's a lot easier said than done. </p>



<p><strong>Especially since there are a lot of new viable builds that you can do now with subclassing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Exactly, there's billions of combinations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>There were people that I had personally worked with on the Blackbird team for 10 years who are no longer with us. That hurts, frankly, that's a really meaningful thing. It's still raw, still emotional, but the team has rallied around and galvanized around Elder Scrolls Online.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A final question about what happened recently with the other ZeniMax Online Studios project. I don't know what you're able to say about that, but I gotta ask. Did anything change in the aftermath? From the outside, people think maybe you are more focused on Elder Scrolls Online now that you've been in a while.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Obviously, there was a massive change, right? And it was a super emotional thing, and it was really difficult. There were people that I had personally worked with on the Blackbird team for 10 years who are no longer with us. That hurts, frankly, that's a really meaningful thing. But we do have a job to do. We do owe it to the community to continue, move forward and press on. So that's what we're doing, and we're focused on that, and that's kind of where Jo Burba came up with this idea of like, we want to support the game. This can be a 30-year MMO.</p>



<p>We are not shutting the doors and backing down and cutting, mothballing ESO to run it out; we're focused on moving ahead and forging ahead with the people we have left. We want to make ESO the best thing it can be, and that's the goal for all of us. Are things different? Well, yeah, of course, right? It's still raw, still emotional, but the team has rallied around and galvanized around Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yeah, exactly. It's been hard and challenging. As Rich said, we lost friends. We're definitely looking to the future to try to make ESO as incredible as possible. This transition between Rich and me had been planned in advance, it just happened at this time, unfortunately. This year was already one of transition. We've been on this path, and we're continuing down it. We are as committed as ever to try to make Elder Scrolls Online as fun as we can.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Plenty of studios make horror videogames, but fewer are dedicated to only making horror games in the way that Bloober Team is. They've had a few stumbles along the way, but are clearly finding their stride after its stunning Silent Hill 2 Remake, and what appears to be another success with the coming Cronos: The New Dawn, which is also heading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> alongside other current-gen consoles and PC.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team's chief executive officer Piotr Babieno indicates that it was no mistake that the studio made the effort to put Cronos, its latest horror adventure, on the Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the fact that it gets the game in front of players who might not have the option to grab Cronos: The New Dawn on other platforms, Babieno grew up a Nintendo fan, and wants to bring back an era where Nintendo was known for more than just the place to get child and family-friendly games.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true</em>. <em>I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4… were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a gold time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now</em>," Babieno said. </p>



<p>"<em>We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team.</em>"</p>



<p>The Switch platform is not entirely devoid of horror games. Alien: Isolation is arguably one of the best horror games in the past two decades, and there's an excellent port of it available on the Switch. That said, the Switch isn't exactly brimming with horror games. Horror doesn't even come up as a genre filter when <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/games/#games-by-genre">browsing for games on the eShop</a>.</p>



<p>Babieno has a long way to achieve his personal dream, but it doesn't sound like he'll be giving up anytime soon. He's even looking to the Japanese company for inspiration on how to keep Bloober Team together through the tough times the video game industry is currently experiencing. </p>



<p>"<em>We didn’t cut any staff at Bloober Team for the last few years</em>.  <em>This is really important because I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects. And I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It isn’t our goal to be the biggest player on the Polish stock exchange</em>," he added. "<em>Our goal is to be the best horror game developer.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-kamrui-mini-pc-16gb-ram-512gb-is-going-like-hotcakes-amazon-slashes-it-to-a-record-low.1283346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is going big for Labor Day and Back to School season, slashing prices on computers just as they are most in demand. This is the time of year when students purchase new items for school and professionals upgrade their rigs, so if there’s ever a time to shell out for a new system at a discount, it’s now.</p>
<p>And today, one of the hottest mini PCs on Amazon just hit a new record low: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the Kamrui GK3Plus mini PC (16GB RAM 512GB M.2 SSD Mini Computers,12th Alder Lake N95), usually listed at $210, has dropped to $152</a>. That’s one of the steepest cuts we’ve seen on this compact powerhouse, and this is the kind of deal that won’t hang around long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved GPU and CPU</h2>
<p>The GK3Plus is a small but serious desktop replacement <strong>based on Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake N95 chip</strong>. Clocking up to 3.4GHz on 4 cores and 6MB of cache, it’s a clear performance step up from the N100 and other previous-gen chips. Benchmarks show that it’s about 35% faster on CPU workloads and nearly 80% better on GPU, so more responsive multitasking and better graphics for your everyday needs.</p>
<p>Filled with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, it can run a number of programs at once without slowing down. That’s especially handy if you live in dozens of browser windows or switch between Office, Zoom, and Photoshop. As for storage, it has a 512GB M.2 SSD which translates to speedy boot times and plenty of space for documents, apps, and media. And if down the line you realize that you’re in need of more storage space, you can expand up to 2TB using a second 2.5-inch drive.</p>
<p>
k</p>
<p>It is a mere 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.9 inches in diameter (small enough to fit in one hand) and can sit quietly on a desk without appropriating valuable real estate. You can even mount it on the back of a VESA-supported monitor and create your own all-in-one solution for an efficient workspace. For home use, you can place it under your TV and turn an ordinary display into a 4K streaming device that handles much more than most smart TVs can handle.</p>
<p>Graphics performance is provided by embedded UHD Graphics at 1.20GHz with 4K at 60Hz and three displays at once through dual HDMI and VGA support. That means sharp text, vibrant colors, and silky smooth play back whether you’re watching movies, working on multiple documents side by side, or gaming at a casual level. Having the ability to work with three screens at once is a huge productivity gain because it enables you to arrange tasks without window juggling.</p>
<p>At this bargain, Amazon’s stock could easily run out before the holiday rush is over.</p>

As we head toward the colder months, The Pokémon Company has launched something a little different from the usual spread of trainer boxes and tins: An advent calendar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company started releasing annual holiday calendars back in 2022, inspired by the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Countdown_Calendar_(TCG)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Countdown Calendar</a> from 2008.

<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ed5c383092fc/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>We were pleased to see Bloober Team pop up at last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> with the announcement that its upcoming sci-fi survival horror <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> will also be arriving on Switch 2 on <strong>5th September</strong>. It's nice to see a Nintendo system treated to the same scares as the other big players in the industry and, as it turns out, the developer has big plans to keep the relationship rolling in the future.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said that he's a huge Nintendo fan, so bringing Cronos to Switch 2 is an attempt to make his "personal dreams come true". Citing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> ("the most important horrors," according to Babieno), the CEO referred to the GameCube's horror scene as a "gold time for Nintendo fans" — something he's keen to bring back.</p>
<p>"In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now," Babieno said of bringing horror games to Switch 2. "We have some plans," he teased, "We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team".</p>
<p>As the team behind last year's critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, this is an exciting prospect. Throw on top the solid previews so far of Cronos: The New Dawn, and our overall good time going hands-on with the Switch 2 version at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-cronos-the-new-dawn-on-switch-2">Gamescom</a>, and we're even more enthused by the mere prospect of more chills and thrills coming our way from the company.</p>
<p>But that's not to say any future Bloober Team plans would necessarily be 'more of the same'. Babieno hinted to The Game Business that the studio already has its eye on the strange mid-point between horror and cosy gaming that Nintendo has struck gold on in the past, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> being a stand-out example. "What Kono-san did with this title was pretty impressive," Babieno said of the ghost-busting GameCube launch title, "And I believe that there is a huge possibility to repeat such an idea in the future".</p>

<p>A Bloober Team survival horror with Luigi's Mansion as a touchstone? Count us in! The CEO even drew a comparison between his studio and the Big N in terms of how the team is structured, particularly when it comes to avoiding layoffs for the greater good of the company's future projects (Bloober Team has been one of the few studios that <em>hasn't</em> seen staff cuts in recent years). “I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects," Babieno said in the same interview. "I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things".</p>
<p>We have just one week to go before Cronos: The New Dawn arrives on Switch 2. It's a game full of gruesome darkness, but let's hope that the future is as bright as Babieno imagines.</p>
