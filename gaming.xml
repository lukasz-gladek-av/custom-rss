		<p>MindsEye was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">revealed during last night’s State of Play broadcast</a> and was one of the most impressive titles on the show with bombastic action and some rather sublime lighting. If you missed the trailer, check it out below and pay close attention to the names and logos found in the last few seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Reveal Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHoIAnnV9LI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is being created by Build A Rocket Boy, the team who are working on <a href="https://everywhere.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, a place where you can create games and worlds without knowing how to code. You may not have noticed the Everywhere logo and text at the bottom of the trailers for MindsEye, but we did and had questions, so reached out to the publishers, IOI Partners, to ask them exactly what that means.</p>
<p>They are keeping things very close to their chest at this time, and would not answer any specific questions but did say “MindsEye will release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and EVERYWHERE, Build A Rocket Boy’s’ immersive entertainment platform.”</p>
<p>So that confirms MindsEye will be running in Everywhere which, depending on how the game has been constructed, could mean that a version of Everywhere is up and running on consoles – it’s presently only available on PC – or that the platform is modular enough that it can produce a standalone version of Mindseye for consoles. It would be quite mad to create multiple separate versions of the game.</p>

<p>Further to this, Everywhere allows you to “reuse and remix the creations from others”, so does that mean that you will be able to rip MindsEye apart and create your own version of the game? PC games have had modding since the very beginning, but allowing people to completely remix a game and use the assets is practically unheard of.</p>

<p>We await further announcements from IOI Partners and Build A Rocket Boy with interest!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-572-42-is-optimized-for-avowed-indiana-jones-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for its GeForce graphics cards. This new version (572.42) is optimized for Obsidian's Avowed, which launches on February 18 but is available starting today through advanced access for pre-orders of the Premium Edition.</p>
<p>By default, the game supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex, as well as ray-traced reflections. With this Game Ready driver, users will be able to unlock NVIDIA app overrides to enable DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, activate the Super Resolution transformer model, the latest improved Frame Generation model, and force DLAA (which isn't available from the in-game settings). We'll take a more in-depth look at visuals and performance in Avowed shortly; meanwhile, check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game review posted earlier today</a>.</p>
<p>GeForce Game Ready driver 572.42 is also optimized for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation update</a>, which will be released next week. The game update will introduce fully ray-traced shadows and DLSS Ray Reconstruction denoising, which, according to NVIDIA, will improve visuals, as showcased in the following picture comparison.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The game will also be updated to take advantage of the NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA transformer model for improved image quality, as well as the enhanced Frame Generation model for better frame rates. Lastly, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will provide maximum performance on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards. NVIDIA says that combined, all these technologies can accelerate performance by up to 4X in the excellent adventure game released two months ago by MachineGames. The new flagship GPU, the RTX 5090, averages 268.6 frames per second at 4K with Super Resolution set to Performance mode and Multi Frame Generation to 4x.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The driver also supports the new Wuthering Waves update that introduces ray tracing, DLSS Frame Generation, and Reflex. You can check out the ray tracing showcase below.</p>
<p>Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery was also released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access yesterday</a> with support for DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-preview-double-vision.1108566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hazelight Studios has become something of a darling since its inception. With projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-e3-2017-hazelight-studios-showcases-way-out" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-stride-across-10-million-barrier" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two</em></a> gathering critical acclaim, the announcement of <em>Split Fiction</em> feels like another step forward for the developer, and a massive one at that.</p>

<p>From the outset, what drew me to the game was its very concept – two characters having to work together, jumping across worlds and even genres in what looked like one of the most creative games I’ve ever seen possible. After getting some time to sit down with <em>Split Fiction</em>, I can safely say that my first impression is not only valid but only scratches the surface of what the team at Hazelight have put together here.</p>

<p>From the several hours I got to play (with a partner of course, since this a cooperative experience), I got to see how <em>Split Fiction</em> opens with a little bit of setup. That setup amounts to a quick introduction to the main characters: two women known as Zoe and Mio, who have been invited to ink their own deal with a company known as Rader Publishing.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-02.jpg?itok=NRF8gC_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-02.jpg?itok=8fHQ-B1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We see the pair meet moments before things start to get a little suspicious – it seems this publishing house and its creator have something more off the books planned for the gathered participants. Mio and Zoe are then tasked to suit up, and prepare to enter an experimental machine – one which will effectively bring their stories to life. Mio, however, isn’t buying it, and as she tries to back out, gets thrown into Zoe’s simulation.</p>

<p>It’s there that the pair ends up on a collision course together, and they’ll have to work in tandem to follow through glitches as they swap each other’s stories in order to escape the system and stop their ideas from being stolen.</p>

<p>What this amounts to is a crazy mash-up of science fiction (courtesy of Mio), and fantasy levels (from Zoe’s mind) combined with fast-paced action spread over a multitude of gameplay styles.</p>

<p>One minute they’ll be in a dystopian sci-fi level with plenty of platforming and having to work together to escape. In the next, Mio and Zoe are in a quaint fantasy town being overrun by trolls and they’re forced to run through the level while jumping over and climbing up obstacles.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-01_0.jpg?itok=NtdTrnCI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-01_0.jpg?itok=Qji817tr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of the different worlds I got to see in the preview, the one that really stood out was a futuristic, sci-fi setting known as Neon Revenge that had Mio and Zoe set up as cyborg ninjas. Not unlike <em>Metal Gear Rising</em>, Mio got to handle a gravity-defying blade, whilst Zoe took control of a whip that could grab items in the environment.</p>

<p>And this wasn’t just a short experience either. This specific story of Mio’s had multiple parts and each one did well to break up the gameplay in fun and interesting ways. In one part, they had to work together to leap across moving vehicles, which lead to a boss fight, which then lead to a racing bike segment, and even that had some wacky gameplay elements like one character needing to solve a CAPCHA on a phone to stop a self-detonation sequence.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em> is just so wild in every way and felt very non-stop from the three hours I got to play of it. That said, there are some quieter moments in things like side stories – one of which had us playing as pigs who needed to grab apples to open doors, and then that lead to a bit of a morbid conclusion.</p>

<p>Then we had a go in a fantasy level that reminded me more of <em>Monster Hunter</em> mixed with <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, and this one was a more laid-back, puzzle-based experience with having to work together as a team to move objects around, create platforms, and activate several items around a temple. So there is that sort of variety in <em>Split Fiction</em> that expands just beyond the frenetic style in some of the levels I did see.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-03.jpg?itok=JG33xPCm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-03.jpg?itok=5Lrijqmv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Beyond that, we were shown a snowboarding level evocative of EA’s own SSX series, Mio and Zoe playing as literal pinballs in a machine against a boss, and a classic sidescrolling shooter level not unlike the Contra series.</p>

<p>There’s a lot, and it’s kind of amazing that all of this has been put into <em>Split Fiction</em>, and that it works so seamlessly. Even with all the genre and gameplay swapping, it never felt cumbersome, and getting used to the controls every time felt rather natural because everything is spelled out and kept to a few buttons regardless of the level.</p>

<p>A lot of the intuitive nature of <em>Split Fiction</em> relies on the co-operative gameplay, and having to work together, and get used to working together to solve platforming puzzles, or activate doors, and even get into a gunship and shoot down enemies together.</p>

<p>There’s a sense of competition as well because both Mio and Zoe have different abilities, and there’s a lot of opportunity to lean into each other’s strengths and then perhaps later, the replayability aspect comes into play because they’re both doing different things despite the split screen across the same worlds.</p>

<p>So yes, <em>Split Fiction</em> is every bit as promising as it looked at first sight. And like I said, I only got to play around three hours total, but in that time there was already such a breadth of variety, I can only be left wondering just what else has been jam-packed into this crazy adventure.</p>

<p>If anything, it’s safe to say Hazelight has another sure-fire hit on their hands and I can't wait to see what happens next when <em>Split Fiction</em> launches in just a few short weeks.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-2-brings-over-1700-fixes-including-a-life-improvements.1108563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.2, a mammoth patch that introduces "over 1700 fixes and improvements to all aspects of the game".</p>

<p>That might sound like a lot of fixes, but it's actually a slightly smaller number than those introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">December's Update 1.1</a>, which boasted more than 1800 improvements and tweaks.</p>

<p>Like that update, though, today's patch brings fixes for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">rather controversial A-Life system</a>, introducing more ways in which NPCs can interact with the world around them. You'll also find changes to balance, optimization, story elements, and much, much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.2-gameplay.jpg?itok=ClJljDbI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.2-gameplay.jpg?itok=Ix-oPoMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>&nbsp;Update 1.2 is here, and it's another big one.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to A-Life, fixes include NPCs no longer being able to loot corpses' body armor and helmets, as well as characters not healing allies NPCs. A-Life NPCs will also no longer have access to quest locations, and the AI can't spawn corpses near the player anymore.</p>

<p>Amusingly, the stealth AI has been improved so that NPCs can no longer "end up behind the player" following a melee attack. So much for studying the blade, I suppose.</p>

<p>An absolute ton of story bugs have been fixed, including characters not spawning during the "Wishful Thinking" mission, as well as the Three Captains mission auto-completing shortly after being accepted.</p>

<p>It's well worth reading through <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes</a> for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.2, although you will probably want to grab a hot drink or something, because reading every single fix is going to take you quite a while.</p>




<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is the latest entry in GSC Game World's ambitious (but frequently janky)&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series. It's absolutely not the second entry, either.</p>

<p>The game once again sees you entering the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in search of loot and fame. You'll meet various factions along the way, each of which has its own agenda, and you'll have to decide how to deal with these factions while also pursuing your own goals.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available on PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/split-fiction-interview-discussing-challenge-of-blending-sci-fi-and-fantasy-in<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anticipations are running high for Hazelight Studios' next game, <em>Split Fiction</em>. Following the success of <em>It Takes Two</em>, studio creative director Josef Fares has set his sights on their most ambitious game yet – one that weaves a multitude of genres and gameplay in a meshing together of sci-fi and fantasy stories.</p>

<p>We had a chance to sit down with the director and discuss some of his journey as a developer from the success of games like <em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/go-on-co-op-journey-with-it-takes-two" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>, to highlighting the challenges of creating <em>Split Fiction</em> and the importance of aiming to provide a fresh and engaging experience for players.</p>

<p>Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>, was highly successful, so it’s a little curious if that was something that was expected given how stacked 2021 was in terms of games and if that has had any impact going into the development of <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>“It’s been a crazy journey,” said Fares.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-04.jpg?itok=T8GO8UIA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-04.jpg?itok=ywzQC-LG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“It’s interesting because I’m a huge gamer myself, it’s kind of a weird feeling but I’m also extremely proud of all that’s happened, and the impact we’ve had in the gaming industry. I strongly believe you do what you believe in, you follow your passion and it’s gonna land good.</p>

<p>“If you’re talking about expectations, it wasn’t really an issue. We know a lot of people love our games, but that can’t be in our heads when we start. You just got to trust your vision and go with it.</p>

<p>“This was definitely the hardest game we have done considering the mechanics and the variety," Fares said. "In [<em>Split Fiction</em>], you need everything to feel crisp and nice and polished. That was super hard.”</p>

<p>So despite the success of <em>It Takes Two</em>, it became more about believing in what you do and going with it. The team never really thought much back on the previous game when starting the process for <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>That said, it’s pretty clear Hazelight does favor a particular style and that’s one built around co-operative gameplay. Defining that style, as well as keeping things fresh, however, is a different story and might not always be restricted to that for the studio.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-05.jpg?itok=lFNr5g1N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-05.jpg?itok=1OPtIq3X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“I often feel that some games are too repetitive,” said Fares. “When I was new in the industry, people were questioning it all the time. But now I have my own studio so nobody can question it, so you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>“And also it started the way all the games we do, it starts from like, I want to play a game like that. So that’s where <em>Brothers</em> started. With that said, Hazelight will always have the co-op DNA in it, but we’ll probably also explore single-player games in the future but with a Hazelight twist.”</p>

<p>In terms of this co-operative core focus for the past 10 years of work, we were curious if Fares had felt there had been a peak to reach, or if there was enough experimentation within that core that sprouts out with each new iteration.</p>

<p>“That would definitely be like, becoming better in designing the co-op games, writing them, production-wise, getting them to a good level of polish,” Fares explained. “We also have something really crazy in this game that’s gonna happen at the end, and I can guarantee you, you’ve never seen it in a video game before. It’s really fucked up."</p>

There’s so much different stuff to experiment with, there’s so many ideas you can do.</p>

<p>“But here, this isn’t your typical co-op [mode], this is written and designed from the beginning as co-op which means you have different characters depending on who you play.”</p>

<p>Certainly, Fares believes there’s a lot of stuff they can become better at. Making a game is a lot harder than making movies, after all, so to him it’s about “how do you keep that passion?”</p>

<p>One thing being introduced to<em> Split Fiction</em> is the addition of optional side stories to flesh out the experience.</p>

<p>“We call them Hazelight moments,” said Fares in reference to one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow">particular grim side story that was shown during the preview</a>. “You can skip them but we’ll make sure you can see them. But we’ve seen that people really want to play them.”</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-07.jpg?itok=oAxPPSEc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-07.jpg?itok=x-onsT1G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But as far as the overall aesthetic of <em>Split Fiction</em> goes, it’s curious to note that it relies on a lot of originality and no specific inspiration.</p>

<p>“The whole core of it was like blending sci-fi and fantasy,” Fares explained. “It felt very fresh and unique, and when we started with that, we thought there was going to be a lot of TV and moves that were similar, but we’ve done nothing really like that. You have parallel universes and stuff, but we haven’t had this combination of fantasy and sci-fi.”</p>

<p>One of the unique aspects of <em>Split Fiction</em> is its dual female protagonists – Mio and Zoe, and there is a bit of an inspiration behind this decision.</p>

<p>“Well, the first game, <em>Brothers</em>, was two males,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/way-out-review-cooperative-camp" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a> also had two males, and<em> It Takes Two</em> had one male and one female,” said Fares.</p>

<p>“Now it’s like, come on, let’s do two females. Otherwise, it becomes, just a lot of guys all over. But yeah, it feels natural. And also, my daughters are Mio and Zoe, so it felt like a right time to do a game about two female characters because there were always so much guys in games. It can’t just be boys.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it can’t just be boys. With that approach in hand, we’re left with one final bit of advice for those who are new to Hazelight’s brand of co-op adventures.</p>

<p>“You’re gonna experience something than you’ve never experienced before,” said Fares. “Get ready for a wild ride, and yeah you’re gonna see some crazy stuff for sure.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Even though Monster Hunter Wilds isn’t out yet, its roadmap and future DLC content plans have been revealed. It’s not everything, granted, but this guide should give you an idea of what to expect in the beginning—including the arrival of Mizutsune.</p>



<p>It’s almost commonplace to let players know what future content is arriving before a game’s even launched. Capcom has copied this approach with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Sony State of Play</a> unveiled some ideas and plans from Capcom’s drawing board.</p>



<p>It’s not a <em>monstrous</em> amount of content announced, but enough to keep us all invested.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-explained">Monster Hunter Wilds Roadmap Explained</h2>

<p><strong>Capcom has revealed Monster Hunter Wilds is getting a lot of free content to support the game with patches, Quests, cosmetics, and fresh creatures to encounter.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-mizutsune">Mizutsune</h3>



<p>I’ll start with the headline maker itself: Mizutsune. First revealed via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/monster-hunter-wilds-launch-trailer-reveals-new-monsters-and-first-post-launch-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a> about Monster Hunter Wilds, Mizutsune&nbsp;is described as a “majestic monster.”</p>



<p>It’s described as having “dance-like attacks and bubbles to attack with a balance of beauty and brutality.” We’re unsure if it’s a general monster or requires more than a bunch of sticks and rocks to bring it down.</p>



<h3 id="h-event-quests-amp-cosmetics">Event Quests &amp; Cosmetics</h3>



<p>Special Quests are being added, rewarding you with “in-game armor with special looks!” It remains to be seen what the Quests entail, but if Monster Hunter Wilds wasn’t already big enough, you need your busy hat on as there’s more work to be done!</p>



<h3 id="h-day-one-ps5-pro-patch">Day One PS5 Pro Patch</h3>



<p>The final key detail we know about Monster Hunter Wilds’ roadmap is a day-one update for PS5 Pro users. Capcom says: “Monster Hunter Wilds will be <strong>PS5 Pro enhanced via a day one patch</strong>, further enhancing immersion with ray tracing.”<a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54323767436_865f200b5c_k.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-mizutsune-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds">When is Mizutsune&nbsp;Coming to Monster Hunter Wilds?</h2>



<p><strong>Mizutsune&nbsp;emerges in Monster Hunter Wilds in Spring 2025, giving you ample to prepare for the creature.</strong></p>



<p>Capcom isn’t showing Mizutsune&nbsp;yet, but it’s clear the monster is a big deal—literally. Stay tuned for further updates on Mizutsune, where to find it, and how to trigger it in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Is it right for companies to announce DLC and roadmaps before launch? Is any negativity offset by declaring the content to be free on release? I’m mixed on the idea, but the transparency is commendable—as is the cost of Wilds’ announced content.</p>



<p>We have many other Monster Hunter Wilds guides including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-monster-hunter-wilds-pre-order-bonuses-how-to-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pre-Order Bonuses</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-how-many-gb-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file size</a> to the latest on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-extends-beta-test-due-to-playstation-network-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beta Test</a>.</p>

<p>The Major Regional Qualifiers for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the BLAST Austin Major</a> will be played entirely online, after consecutive years of offline qualifiers determining which Counter-Strike teams attend the Major. BLAST has <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/blasttv-austin-major-mrqs-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the full details of the MRQ’s, which are scheduled to take place in April.</p>



<h2 id="h-blast-tv-austin-major-regional-qualifiers-information">BLAST.tv Austin Major Regional Qualifiers Information</h2>



<p>Because of the decision to those the Major Regional Qualifiers online, the MRQs for the Americas and Asia will be split into sub-regions to prevent major ping issues. Valve added to their Major rulebook this year that Major qualifiers could be held online, so it’s not surprising to see tournament organizers take advantage.</p>



<p>In Europe, the top 10 teams according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve Regional Standings</a> will be invited directly to Stage 2 or Stage 3 of the Major. The next 16 ranked teams, starting with number 11, will compete in the European MRQ, in a Swiss stage featuring best-of-three matches for advancement and elimination. The top six from this Swiss stage will qualify for Stage 1 of the Major. The dates for the European MRQ are April 14-17.</p>



<p>The top five Americas teams will be invited directly to the Major. The Americas MRQ will consist of a North American MRQ and a South American MRQ. Each one is an eight-team GSL-style group stage, consisting of the top teams from each sub-region, excluding the top five Americas teams already invited. Three teams from each sub-region will qualify for Stage 1 of the Major. The dates for the Americas MRQs are April 15-17.</p>



<p>Only the top ranked team in Asia will be invited directly to the Major. The Asian MRQ will consist of three for each sub-region: China, Oceania/Southeast Asia, and Mongolia/Western Asia. Each region will utilize a four-team double elimination bracket. The sub-region with the highest-ranked invited team will send two teams to Stage 1, while the other sub-regions will send one team to Stage 1. The dates for the Asian MRQs are April 15-17.</p>

            <p>Last week, EA head Andrew Wilson suggested <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> would have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">performed better for the publisher had it been a live-service game</a> - a remark that raised eyebrows around the industry, and prompted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/id-probably-like-quit-former-dragon-age-leads-react-to-eas-suggestion-the-veilguard-should-have-been-live-service">former Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw to state he would "probably, like, quit that job or something"</a> if a company ever suggested this to him.</p>
<p>And, Laidlaw isn't alone in his condemnation of Wilson's comments. Hazelight founder Josef Fares - who has regularly partnered with EA to get his games published - has also scoffed at the remark, and said the A Way Out and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> maker will "never be a live-service game studio", and live-service will "<em>never</em> be [his] choice."</p>

<p>Speaking with Eurogamer during a preview event for Hazelight's upcoming co-op caper Split Fiction, which EA is once again publishing, Fares stressed his aversion to live service games. "We will not have them, I do not believe in them," he said in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>"I think [live service] is not the right way to go," the studio founder furthered. "I hope more and more [developers] focus on their passion, and what they believe in. At the end of the day, we see clearly - and Hazelight is living proof - that when you trust in your vision and go with it, you can still reach a big audience. That's what I want people to focus on."</p>
<p>Fares continued: "I have an understanding that publishers have a lot of, you know, worries about the 'money issue'. But, I think also you have to understand that we are working with a piece of art here, so you have to respect the creativity as well. They have to meet in the middle. You can't also be too much focused on creativity. You can't just say 'give me $100m, I want to do what I want to do'.</p>
<p>"But, there has to be a balance. It can't just be towards the finance side. So, no, it will not happen with a Hazelight game, ever. I guarantee."</p>

<p>The second season of Twisted Metal is set to debut this summer on Peacock, although a more concrete release date hasn't been announced as yet.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twisted-metal-tv-adaptation-renewed-for-second-season-on-peacock">series was renewed for a second season in December 2023</a>. "I have to give a Sweet Tooth-sized thank you to our incredible fans - I read every comment and was so blown away by everyone's love, support, and rabid enthusiasm for a paper bag," Twisted Metal showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith said at that time.</p>
<p>"We are beyond thankful we get to continue the story of John Doe, Quiet, and Sweet Tooth as they face off against familiar faces and new grim foes in the long-awaited Twisted Metal tournament. The mixtape is made, and I'm thrilled to get back on the road with our stellar cast and crew."</p>
<p>The first season of Twisted Metal was nominated for Best Adaptation at the 2023 Game Awards, however <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">this accolade ended up going to HBO's The Last of Us TV series</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Things are bad lately in so many different areas that you might be finding it hard to keep up. One of those areas is the arts, with Trump and his administration making several recent moves that target trans people in particular.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump made good on his promise of the <a href="https://people.com/trump-announces-plan-to-take-over-the-kennedy-center-8788363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous week</a> and became chairman of the board of The Kennedy Center, a national site for theater, music, dance, and performance in Washington DC that you might best know for its annual <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/honors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honors</a>. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/02/12/trump-elected-kennedy-center-board-chair/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a>, “This marks the first time a president has removed his predecessor’s board members at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair.” The Post also quotes Trump as saying</p><blockquote><p>So we took over the Kennedy Center. We didn’t like what they were showing and various other things… I’m going to be chairman of it, we’re going to make sure that it’s good and it’s not going to be woke.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The Post also writes that “Trump has cited the Kennedy Center hosting drag shows as one reason he wanted to reshape the institution.”</p><p>At another long-standing arts institution, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5293082/trump-executive-orders-dei-nea-arts-organizations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Endowment for the Arts has cut its “Challenge America” funding</a>, a program that “offers support for projects that extend the reach of the arts to underserved groups/communities” according to an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lhjsmjrank2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archive </a>of its site. The NEA <a href="https://www.arts.gov/news/press-releases/2025/updates-national-endowment-arts-fy-2026-grant-opportunities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that “This change is to focus NEA staff resources on the Grants for Arts Projects category;” that project focuses on “celebrat[ing] the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity by honoring the semiquincentennial of the United States of America.” America’s 250th anniversary is the focus of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/celebrating-americas-250th-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">executive order</a> by Trump. The <a href="https://www.arts.gov/grants/legal-requirements-and-assurance-of-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated NEA guidelines</a> note that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The applicant will not operate any programs promoting “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws,&nbsp; in accordance with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Executive Order No. 14173</a>.</p><p>The applicant understands that federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology, pursuant to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Executive Order No. 14168</a>.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This news hits particularly hard for me. Before I was in journalism, I devoted my career to trans art, writing plays and putting on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031208174741/http://www.stages2003.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a theater festival</a> and co-founding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topside_Press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small press</a> dedicated to trans fiction. Institutions like The Kennedy Center and the NEA weren’t on our radar back then, because we knew no grant-making organization or national arts center would touch the kind of work we were doing: trans work for trans people, instead of trying to explain ourselves to cis audiences. We funded it ourselves or from our community; we rented cheap space and bartered our labor and leaned on our networks. While some of the work itself has been lost to time, I’ve always been so proud to see what’s grown from its foundations; we might not have been part of the infamous “<a href="https://time.com/135480/transgender-tipping-point/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trans tipping point</a>,” but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Turner_Schofield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performers</a> we <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/43093/1/mirha-soleil-ross-morgan-m-page-chelsea-manning-trans-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcased</a> and <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/imogen-binnie-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writers</a> <a href="https://roommagazine.com/whats-new/interview/casey-plett-on-creating-community-in-meanwhile-elsewhere-and-little-fish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone_on_the_Moon_Is_Essential_Personnel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detransition,_Baby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worked</a> with have gone on to make culture-changing work with more reach than I ever thought possible. The more mainstream acceptance of trans <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work</a> today was unthinkable to me back then, and I’m in awe of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/04/13/trans-representation-popular-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current trans artists</a> finding success or security through doors I always thought of as permanently closed. But the political and artistic time I came up in means there’s a part of me that’s long thought trans people’s presence in an art world dominated by cis people has always been conditional.</p><p>Something that made me reconsider that stance, if only for a night, was actually a show I attended at The Kennedy Center while living in DC, the <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/news-room/press-release-landing-page/wno-american-opera-initiative-press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Opera Initiative</a>’s performance of three short operas that I went to in the winter of 2023. I consider myself an opera fan, with all the high-mindedness and squinting at subtitles the name implies, but the operas in the showcase were experimental and raucous; the audience laughed and cheered and leapt to their feet during the performance. One opera in particular focused on trans issues, and as much as I like to see myself as beyond the need for “representation,” my aloof posturing melted away at seeing trans people in such an old art form, on one of the nation’s most prestigious stages. I was, despite how I see myself, hugely moved by the performance, and it reinvented how I saw opera and trans people’s place in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The loss of opportunities like that is a tragedy, even if I don’t find it a surprise. Here’s where the suspicion I’ve never put down maybe serves me, or at least protects my heart: I always thought this would happen, one way or another, and I built an artistic world that didn’t need such institutions to survive and thrive. These decrees aren’t some kind of “end” to trans art, and whatever overtures these moves make toward eradicating it can’t help but fail, because I don’t believe we’ve ever truly needed cis people’s support to do our work, and there is an entire world out there outside of national organizations and grants. But it still hurts to see such an explicit focus on erasing trans people from the arts. As much as I tell myself I’ve been here before, this is something different than the disinterest that defined my early years. As Casey Plett pointed out in the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/think-this-is-a-rollback-of-trans-rights-no-this-is-something-entirely-new-and/article_daafecfc-de70-11ef-b033-47c7540c7605.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toronto Star</a>, writing about Trump’s passport orders&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Some have called this a “rollback” of trans rights. But that’s not quite the right term. A rollback implies a return to a previous state. But various forms of those rights had always existed… The totalizing Trump ID restrictions are not <em>regressive</em>, they are <em>new</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This holds true for the NEA and The Kennedy Center too; previously, they just wouldn’t have considered us– now, they’re literally <em>barred</em> from doing so. I’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/bathroom-bill-nancy-mace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said before</a> that I was able to live my trans life and make my trans work not because governments or systems protected or wanted it, but because they couldn’t <em>stop </em>me from doing it. That’s changed now, in ways that take my breath away when I let myself feel the full weight of it all. There’s a kind of progress in the world going from disinterest in trans people to caring <em>so much</em> about us, and while much of that care–the greater amount, I hope–is good, there’s also a group of people willing to put their full energy into hating us, into trying to make sure not just that progress is erased, but that our lives are <em>worse</em> than before, pulling every lever in their power to do so.</p><p>It’s strange to be so angry and sad about the loss of horizons I never thought it was possible to sail toward, but while the Trump administration might own the institutions, they can’t ultimately do away with trans art in any meaningful sense. At my core, I’m not afraid of them; Trump and his cohort don’t matter to me in a way that really <em>matters</em>, despite how very bad and dangerous and even unlivable they are eager to make my life. My confidence comes from a lot of places–my politics, my faith–but also from trans art, from the work we’ve made with and for each other for decades upon decades, which didn’t depend on them for its existence and doesn’t now. I’m sad about the losses we’ll see in the next four years and maybe beyond; I mourn the art we won’t get because of this. But that art found its way before, and will still, and will again. We never needed them, and we still don’t need them, and they’ve never been able to stop us.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that the PS5 has enjoyed its best quarter yet in terms of sales, bringing total lifetime unit shipments past a major milestone.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report</a> (which covers the fiscal year's third quarter), Sony reveals that it sold 9.5 million PS5 units during the quarter, bringing the console's total lifetime sales over the 75 million mark.</p>

<p>The quarter stands as the PS5's best yet, beating the same period in 2023 by 1.3 million sales despite the fact that the third quarter of 2023 offered up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">a major hit in the form of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>This means two things. First off, we don't know how well the PS5 Pro has done in isolation; we only know that it's contributed in some way to the 9.5 million number. Second, We don't know what proportion of that 9.5 million consoles represents PS5 Pro sales.</p>

<p>While it's more than likely Sony's hardware business got a boost from the PS5 Pro, the console does boast what is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">arguably a rather prohibitive price point</a> for a general gaming audience, so whether it's sold the kind of numbers that would significantly boost the console's totals is hard to say.</p>

<p>Still, it'll likely provide a confidence boost for Sony, especially after a year that offered up what is probably one of the company's biggest gaming embarrassments in history in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">launch and swift cancellation</a> of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>

<p>Sony also reports an increase in PlayStation Plus users, which will likely come as a relief since subscriber numbers remained static throughout the first two quarters of the year.</p>

<p>As for the future, Sony held a State of Play showcase yesterday during which it showed off upcoming PS5 games like&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>.

<p>Funko Fusion developer 10:10 Games has recently undergone restructuring within the studio which includes some layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that 10:10 Games made changes with the last week as part of projects within the company wrapping up. We were told that the restructuring was being done to better meet the needs of current projects within the studio. What those projects are, however, remains unknown.</p>



<p>As far as the number of people let go, sources have indicated that it’s around 20 employees. 10:10 Games has yet to give clarification on the exact number of people who were laid off despite multiple requests.</p>



<p>Sources say that the company is assisting with those let go, but couldn’t verify whether that includes any sort of severance as of publishing.</p>



<p>Founded in 2021 by industry veterans Arthur Parsons and Traveller’s Tales founder Jon Burton, 10:10 Games is based in Warrington, United Kingdom. The studio released Funko Fusion, its first game, in September 2024. According to the latest public records and information from the studio’s website, 10:10 Games employed around 100 people before the layoffs. </p>



<p>Through the first seven weeks of 2025, the games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 known jobs lost</a> across 27 companies.  Multiple companies have yet to make headcounts public, meaning t hat it’s likely the number is well over 1,000 at this point. In 2024, the industry saw over 16,000 estimated losses.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-review"><u>an insect-filled survival game</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pentiment-review"><u>a 2D detective story straight out of the 16th century</u></a> that were pleasantly surprising departures from what developer Obsidian does best, Avowed is a return to that traditional action RPG comfort food we know and love. Set in the fantasy universe of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/27/pillars-of-eternity-review">Pillars of Eternity</a>, this is a game that’s filled with all my favorite RPG cliches, like standing around a campfire with my party members to exchange dark backstories and unresolved traumas, and looting every single slain enemy before their corpse has even begun to cool. Per Obsidian’s pedigree, the writing, world-building, and open-world maps are all quite good, and running around lobbing deadly spells at reanimated skeletons and violent lizard folk to claim shiny new gear is as entertaining as you might expect, if not exactly breaking new ground. That’s a bit of a trend, actually: Avowed draws so much from the Skyrims and Dragon Ages of the past that it ends up an overall unsurprising adventure that has few distinctive ideas to call its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As both a chosen Godlike imbued with magical powers and the Envoy of the Emperor your character is granted a downright irresponsible amount of authority to do whatever you please, and you’re dispatched to the wild continent of the Living Lands to put an end to a mysterious plague of madness called the Dreamscourge while also finding the time to aid any person on the street who asks you for help with whatever personal problem they might have. You’ll spend your days delving into ruined yet beautiful caves, sewers, and forgotten places in search of loot and XP, while taking every opportunity to whale on beasts and ne’er-do-wells with swords, bows, and spells. Yes, this is basically the premise of every western RPG from the past several decades, but that’s because it’s a formula that works reliably. Avowed executes almost every aspect of it quite well.</p><div id="how-do-you-rank-obsidians-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3><h3>How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is especially true of the dialogue and story, which is without question the thing Avowed does best. Unraveling the mystery of the fungal Dreamscourge and the otherworldly forces at play is a journey well worth seeing to its conclusion, especially since your decisions can have a profound impact on how things end up – the ending I got hinted at loads of things that could have gone much differently and my fingerprints were all over the ultimate fate of the Living Lands, which could make it worth another playthrough to see how things might have gone differently. And although you usually don’t make major world-changing decisions until you’re just about to move on to the next zone, there are a few times where the consequences of my choices were immediately and keenly felt, like the time I decided to cast a spell so powerful it <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span>, and everyone hated me thereafter. Granted, most of the twists and turns that Avowed’s plot sets up become pretty apparent well before your character and their companions become aware of them, which is a bit disappointing given the Pillars of Eternity series’ track record for wild revelations that took me by surprise. Even so, the story kept the adventure running full steam the whole time, especially with interesting choices to make to keep you company along the way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bringing the catlike and relentlessly horny mage Yatzli along will guarantee some choice innuendos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bantering alongside your four companions, each of whom brings their own opinions, personal problems for you to untangle, and cool combat and puzzle-solving abilities to rely upon while exploring the Living Lands is especially delightful. Just like in sister Obsidian RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review">The Outer Worlds</a>, you can bring two of these rapscallions with you at a time, which allows you to experiment with different pairings for mechanical purposes or just to hear them trash talk your decisions. Hanging out with Kai, the sarcastic reptilian mercenary with a fondness for woodworking is rarely dull, and bringing the furry, catlike, and relentlessly horny mage Yatzli along will almost guarantee you won’t have to go very long without some choice innuendos. Sadly, she’s just a tease: you can’t actually romance any of them, and the social links you can develop are fairly shallow. That seems like a fairly big miss since it’s otherwise great at building camaraderie with your eclectic found family, and even a fade-to-black sexytime scene can give you something to remember an RPG playthrough by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaning into Obsidian’s substantial worldbuilding chops, Avowed is absolutely brimming with lore that builds upon the world the Pillars of Eternity games established, and it’s easy to lose hours just reading books and scrolls or discussing politics with the locals of every major region. Better still, even if you aren’t an expert on the world of Eora, there’s an extremely handy reference guide that populates with key places, factions, people, and concepts unique to the world whenever a character brings it up in a conversation, similar to the active time lore feature in Final Fantasy XVI. So before you make that really important decision that might well carry dire consequences, you can quickly toggle over to make sure you understand what they heck they’re talking about before proceeding. That makes Avowed’s typical fantasy setting that’s filled with what can quickly become too many made-up words and foreign concepts a whole heck of a lot easier to navigate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you aren’t chatting up the locals, you’ll probably be sending them back to The Wheel for reincarnation via Avowed’s tumultuous combat. You’ll face off against the usual baddies, from typical fantasy creatures and animals to anthropomorphic mushrooms and people driven to madness by the Dreamscourge. Fighting with melee weapons and magic feels smoother and more competent than it does in many similar fantasy RPGs, but evading dozens of enemies as they charge through sickly marshes and barren deserts isn’t as easy as it looks. I spent most of my time playing as a squishy wizard who had little in the way of protection and had to do my best to keep my distance, quick-dodge like a champ, and rain down as many high-powered spells as I could to keep them at bay. I’m especially fond of one that opens a black hole that lifts enemies helplessly into the air, and another that fills the area with a deadly lightning storm. Alternatively, there are more martial character build options that require more blocking, stabbing, and making use of power attacks to break the enemy’s guard, and each of these has their own skill trees that let you do neat things like smack enemies onto their backs with a powerful ramming attack. As someone who insists on playing on the hardest difficulty on my first run, I definitely found myself knocked on my butt more than a few times, and accidentally stumbling into an area that I wasn’t properly leveled for was quite humbling. But it was never insurmountable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There so many bears in this world! Even when it doesn’t really make any sense. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My biggest issue with combat is in the variety of opponents: for the vast majority of my 50-hour completionist run (you could easily beat it in less than half that time if you breeze past some side quests and play on normal difficulty) I found myself fighting the same handful of enemy types everywhere I ventured, and almost none of them are interesting or unique in their behaviors to begin with. There’s, of course, skeletons in need of re-killing, oversized spiders that spit gunk at you, and bears (oh my). And by God, are there so many bears in this world! Even when it doesn’t really make any sense for them to be here, they throw a few bears into the mix. A bandit camp with half a dozen ruffians sitting around a campfire? Why not add two pet bears to the party? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few hours the novelty of fighting these humdrum fantasy baddies, and my interest in squaring off against them, diminished. Every once in a while something big, scary, and unexpected would arrive and make me remember how to defeat a non-bear opponent, but these welcome surprises are too few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avowed Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully there’s plenty more to do and see while exploring each of Avowed’s four substantial open-world hubs, each filled with side quests to complete, minor puzzles to solve, hidden chests to loot, and people to talk smack to. You’ll go from a forested port town to a creepy, corrupted countryside, then to a perilous desert and an ashen wasteland with an active volcano spewing lava every which way. It’s a structure that resembles The Outer Worlds’ separate planets: None of the maps are especially big, but they make great use of the space they have, and they’re all delightfully colorful and brimming with personality that’s a welcome change from the sometimes drab and dull places we end up exploring in other RPGs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It felt as if the clean-up crew was going to show up to break down the set at any moment.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Those maps are great to explore the first time you go through them, though they don’t give you many reasons to stick around or run through again since enemies never respawn. This is a blessing insofar as you don’t have to retread the same areas to fight monsters (and bears) that have arbitrarily reappeared, but this also means any backtracking is completely devoid of life. They’re empty to the point where I felt extremely pressured to move onto the next zone as soon as possible because it felt as if the clean-up crew was going to show up to break down the set and remove the furniture at any moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One unique aspect of Avowed’s exploration is just how much it wants you to engage with its parkour system: it gives you ample opportunities to leap from ledge to ledge, mantling over this and that as you search for hidden treasure chests and avoid traps. This is an emphasis on mobility that’s fairly unusual for the genre, and it adds an activity that’s a welcome change from the routine to focus on in between (or sometimes during) combat. You won’t be doing wall-running or anything quite so fancy as what you’d find in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-2-stay-human-review">Dying Light 2,</a> but it’s still an interesting extra dimension to break up the conventional dungeon delving. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite RPGs</h3><p>If you're looking to get transported to another world, here are my the best escape destinations I can think of!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren’t a lot of big new ideas that set Avowed apart, there are some nice smaller ones that I’d love to see every RPG hereafter learn from. For example, although there’s a stamina system during combat whereby you can exhaust yourself and lose the ability to fight back for a short time, running never drains it, whether you’re in or out of combat. So I appreciated that Avowed never inflicted the all-too-familiar annoyance of constantly running out of energy every 15 seconds when sprinting around the world. Similarly, you have encumbrance limits when looting items, but it’s quite generous with the space it gives you, even if you’re a wimpy wizard with a relatively small capacity like myself. What’s more, only larger items like weapons and armor count towards your carrying capacity, while consumables, materials, and other small items are weightless, ammo for guns and arrows for bows are unlimited, and larger items can be dismantled on the spot to turn them into valuable (and weightless) materials. There’s even an option to just hit a “send to camp” button anywhere in the world to instantly transport loot to your stash. These little details might not be genre-shifting refinements, but as someone who is easily infuriated by meaningless limitations that start to feel terrible after dozens of hours, they were seriously a godsend and I appreciate Obsidian’s thoughtful approach to removing some traditional RPG friction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet if there’s one thing that impressed me the most about Avowed, it’s the fact that across my 50+ hours with it on Xbox Series X, I encountered almost no glitches or technical issues worth mentioning. There was one time where I unwittingly killed an optional boss before accepting the quest to hunt it down, another where my compass wouldn’t tell me where to go for the next part of the main story, and sometimes I’d see odd polygons pop in and out while exploring the world. But I can count the number of times these things happened on one hand, and I didn’t experience a single crash even once during my entire time playing. That’s all but unprecedented for this genre, and an extremely welcome surprise.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian’s RPGs in the first place. However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that’s more familiar than evolutionary, and there’s bear-ly any enemy variety to keep its swords-and-sorcery battles interesting for long. Even if it doesn’t swing for the fences or leave a memorable mark on the genre, though, it’s still perfectly competent with all the tried-and-true stuff I expect, including chaotic combat, leveling systems and a loot progression that lets you build the kind of character you want to play, and meaningful decisions that can have a massive impact on the world. Plus, the whole thing’s surprisingly technically stable compared to its reliably unreliable peers. I enjoyed my time parkouring my way through Eora and think you will too – just don’t expect Avowed to show you anything you haven’t seen before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

An evil organization called Theia's Vanguard has taken over the Mashmak Isles and its massive supply of Corite.

			<p>The second Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC patch is now live, introducing various improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.212.1.0 focuses mostly on stability improvements based on the developer's research and player reports. Among these are stability improvements on AMD GPUs introduced by disabling Anti-Lag 2, as the initialization of the tech's SDK caused driver crashes and, thus, instability.</p>
<p>Stability improvements are only some of the enhancements the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch brings. According to the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/576000532521418781?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, game version 1.212.1.0 also featured improved adjustability of Mouse Sensitivity, improved screen-space reflections, and new NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction options that allow users to enable it at native resolution and with the Ultra Performance setting. Rounding up the new additions included in today's patch are a variety of bug fixes and the ability to use Nintendo Switch Pro controllers with Steam Input.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was released two weeks ago on PC, and its launch was far from the best for PlayStation to PC ports due to stability issues and other visual issues, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">launch report</a>, which have yet to be completely fixed.</p>
<p><em>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version for the time being.</em></p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios' parent company Embracer Group has announced that the developer's medieval RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "significantly outperformed" its expectations with regards to sales.</p>

<p>In its latest financial report (which covers the period between October and December 2024, but also features a look ahead to the next quarter), Embracer reveals that <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>is "fast approaching" two million sales.</p>

<p>That means the game has picked up another million sales between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">its first day on release</a>, which would explain why Embracer considers the game to have exceeded its sales estimates. Those are impressive numbers, especially for what is arguably a non-triple-A game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Qa7ojw9I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Fh-avwum 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "outperformed" Embracer's expectations for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that it has a "strong belief" the medieval RPG will "continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years", pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">"robust roadmap"</a> Warhorse Studios has in place for the game's next twelve months.</p>

<p>All in all, Embracer says it expects to enjoy a stronger fourth quarter thanks to both&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>and the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for launch in March</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like Early Access roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Embracer was hoping for, since the company says its Q4 will be "slightly negatively impacted" by the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched into Early Access in January and was quickly met with a negative reception, with players pointing to problems with the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">performance and accessibility features</a>, as well as what some perceive to be odd or poor design decisions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=xl2m0kkV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=l-zf5x-y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem to have achieved the sales numbers Embracer would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Embracer says that it currently has "10 AAA games under development, of which eight are from internal studios and two from external studios".</p>

<p>The company says this number doesn't include anything being released in the current quarter, so it sounds like games like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>aren't part of that figure. The games in question are set to release over the next three fiscal years.</p>

<p>Embracer also points to its "exciting mid-sized releases" schedule, which includes games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em></a>, ARPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, and the console release for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><br>The first teaser for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">Sony and Screen Gems’ big screen <em>Until Dawn</em> adaptation</a> made it seem like it might just be another supernatural horror with a splash of <em>Groundhog Day </em>tossed in to keep things mildly interesting. But judging from the way the studios are describing the film, it sounds like this <em>Until Dawn </em>will also feature another important element from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">its video game counterpart</a>.</p><p>Though old man Hill (Peter Stomare) still won’t tell Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends just what kind of danger they’re wandering into in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s new trailer, the meddling youths have a much easier time figuring out the basics of what’s going on. Somehow, the strange building they’re staying in is able to hurdle them back through time after they’re murdered by different kinds of monsters, and the phenomenon gives them another chance to survive through the night.</p><p>That much was obvious in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s first teaser, and the new trailer shows off a few more of the ghouls Clover’s group will encounter. Something that was less apparent, though, was how the movie will limit the number of extra lives each character will have. According to Sony and Screen Gems’ new synopsis for the film, the fact that group only gets a handful do-vers is one of the more terrifying things about their situation. That makes it sound like a couple of characters might run out before they’re able to escape, which could make <em>Until Dawn </em> feel even more like the game when it hits theaters on April 25th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The one for the stretchy scientist Mr. Fantastic doubles as both popcorn bucket and drink holder. His arm is stretched and coiled around the bucket itself, and then his hand at the end holds your Icee. What a gentleman. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f97d695c54ac8d0a09fb95d15f4b978e" data-recommend-id="image://f97d695c54ac8d0a09fb95d15f4b978e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket that is half blue and half clear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket that is half blue and half clear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BossLogic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f97d695c54ac8d0a09fb95d15f4b978e" data-recommend-id="image://f97d695c54ac8d0a09fb95d15f4b978e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket that is half blue and half clear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Invisible Woman popcorn bucket is more straightforward, but manages to capture her invisible essence. For the most part it’s a standard popcorn bucket with a blue finish that resembles the group’s costumes. However, the lower section is clear and fades into the blue, emulating Sue’s power to disappear without a trace. If your power is to not be seen, it’s probably hard to capture that in a tangible thing people could buy at a movie theater, without just making a clear bucket, so I commend BossLogic for figuring this one out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-recommend-id="image://f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BossLogic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-recommend-id="image://f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The popcorn bucket for The Human Torch is cheeky, but so is the fire-wielding hero. The bucket is a beat-up fire extinguisher cabinet, implying it’s seen a lot of use over the years. The glass cover opens and inside you’ll find some popcorn for your movie. Hunger is an emergency worth breaking the glass.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="94278ac410b70b9ded2c816da0191db6" data-recommend-id="image://94278ac410b70b9ded2c816da0191db6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like The Thing's hand holding his fedora upside down with popcorn inside it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like The Thing's hand holding his fedora upside down with popcorn inside it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BossLogic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94278ac410b70b9ded2c816da0191db6" data-recommend-id="image://94278ac410b70b9ded2c816da0191db6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like The Thing's hand holding his fedora upside down with popcorn inside it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The final popcorn bucket mock-up for The Thing looks like it might be better suited for giving small portions. It just doesn’t have the deep bowl required for a large popcorn at the movie theater. Despite this, the design is still pretty good. The bucket is made to look like The Thing’s rocky hand holding his trademark fedora, which holds the popcorn inside. It’s a cute idea, but the theater better offer free refills—that’s not enough popcorn for a 90-minute movie.</p><hr><p><em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>is coming to theaters on July 25, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next movie, <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> is out now and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/captain-america-4-reviews-round-up-messy-bad-boring-1851761664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/captain-america-4-reviews-round-up-messy-bad-boring-1851761664">apparently not great</a></span>.
