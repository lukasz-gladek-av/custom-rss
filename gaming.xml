While it might not include games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses"><em>Hades</em></a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/25/16930312/celeste-review-pc-switch-ps4-xbox-one"><em>Celeste</em></a>, this $18 still offers an excellent collection of 8 visual novels that put queer characters in the spotlight. Some of the games included in this bundle feature the fantasy-flavored coffee shop simulator <em>Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly,</em> and the supernatural dating sim <em>The World Next Door</em>. Or, if you’d like to find out what happens when thirsty queers pilot giant mecha, you might want to check out <em>Heaven Will Be Mine</em>.</p>
<p id="0TA8Q9">Of course, if you’d like to dodge the interpersonal drama, this bundle also includes farming sims like <em>Wylde Flowers</em> and <em>Lakeburg Legacies</em> in addition to its collection of excellent visual novels.</p>

<p id="17VJcF">As with other Humble Bundles, by default a portion of the sale goes to benefit a non-profit — in this case, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>, a foundation dedicated to ending self-harm among LGBTQ youth by providing access to crisis services and peer support. Just remember you can always use the “Adjust Donation” drop-down menu to fine-tune how much goes to the publisher, the charity in question, and Humble.</p>

Ever since, fans have been desperate for a taste of what Retro Studios has been working on. The result was years of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DailyPrime4News/status/1768334142792491279&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DailyPrime4News/status/1768334142792491279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no news</a></span>” on the upcoming first-person shooter with the exception of that one time Nintendo revealed that development had been re-booted.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-switch-retro-studios-1848510132&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-switch-retro-studios-1848510132"> Then today</a></span>, fans received not just a gameplay trailer and 2025 release window, but over a dozen screenshots full of clues for them to spend the next several months devouring like a pack of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Zoomer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Zoomer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rabid Zoomers</a></span>. </p><p>The trailer showed space pirates and what looked like a Galactic Federation base. It’s unclear what everyone’s doing there or what new powers Samus will wield this time around. Today’s brief look mostly teased the existing arsenal the bounty hunter’s had all throughout the previous entries in the <em>Prime</em> subseries, including beam weapons, missiles, environmental scanners, and her iconic Morph Ball ability. For the most part, <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> definitely looks a whole lot like <em>Metroid Prime</em>, with some shots buzzing with space alien possibilities and others feeling surprisingly bland and muted for a game that’s been in development for close to a decade. </p><p>Will <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> be one of the first cross-gen games to appear on Switch 2 as well? Maybe even with a few visual enhancements, including better framerates and some ray-tracing-lite feature? We’ll find out as its 2025 release window gets closer. In the meantime, here’s a look at all of the screenshots Nintendo curated from <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>'s triumphant return to the online showcase hype-cycle. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-fans-are-already-theorizing-when-and-where-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-place<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The timeline discussion comes for us all.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">Nintendo announced The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom today, </a>and you know what that means: timeline speculation. X/Twitter and Reddit are lighting up with speculation about where, exactly, Echoes of Wisdom falls in Zelda's complicated history. </p><p>On r/Zelda, a thread titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/eow_idk_if_this_was_obvious_bu_the_game_uses_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[EOW] Idk if this was obvious, bu the game uses the map from ALTTP/ALBW</a>" popped up almost immediately. The thread pointed out that, based on what we've seen so far, several parts of Hyrule line up nicely with the map from A Link to the Past and A Link Between Worlds. However, the map isn't a 1:1: Death Mountain, as thread creator u/FelipeKits points out, is in the wrong place. We also saw a Gerudo in the trailer, who do not appear in the Fallen Hero/Downfall timeline, which kicks off if Link loses to Ganondorf during their final encounter in Ocarina of Time. </p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/comment/l9604ix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">u/scdsco</a> points out that many of the things we saw simply aren't in A Link to the Past: "There were lots of areas in the trailer and official art that don’t exist in alttp, like a rainforest area, a volcano, a gerudo town and an icy mountain."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zelda2-1718735700533.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/eow_idk_if_this_was_obvious_bu_the_game_uses_the/">u/FelipeKits on Reddit</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>In another thread titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/eow_echoes_of_wisdom_a_link_to_the_past_maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[EoW] Echoes of Wisdom &amp; A Link to the Past Maps</a>," u/Ryon21_ posted a more detailed comparison between the A Link to the Past and Echoes of Wisdom maps, theorizing that Echoes of the Wind's map is an expansion of A Link to the Past's, with new areas to the west and northwest of the original.</p><p>One of the most interesting tidbits, however, is that Echoes of Wisdom includes both of the series' Zora designs, which marks the first time both have appeared in a single game. The decision to include both types of Zoras (ahem) echoes the merging of several elements that had previously been exclusive to a single branch of the timeline, something we also saw in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which take place long, long after any other game currently on the timeline.</p><p>At this moment, signs seem to point to Echoes of Wisdom taking place somewhere in the Fallen Hero/Downfall timeline. Some fans, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/comment/l95zkt4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like u/ZeldaExpert74</a>, theorize that it's actually the start of the Fallen Hero/Downfall timeline, taking place between Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past. Other theories place Echoes of Wisdom between A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, or after A Link Between Worlds and Tri Force Heroes. These connections make sense: Echoes of Wisdom's art style is essentially the same as the Link's Awakening remake on Switch. If nothing else, everyone seems to agree on one thing: it's not part of the Wind Waker branch of the timeline.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zelda-1718735740956.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Fans are already cooking up theories on where and when Echoes of Wisdom takes place.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While speculation is fun, it's also worth noting that Nintendo seems rather... disinterested in the Zelda timeline of late. The publisher hasn't officially placed a new game on the timeline in nearly a decade, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/the-legend-of-zelda-tri-force-heroes-place-in-series-timeline-revealed">though series producer Eiji Anouma did confirm that the Link from A Link Between Worlds is the same one that appears in Tri Force Heroes.</a> Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feature elements from every timeline, so perhaps things merge in the future. Perhaps Echoes of Wisdom takes place closer to them than it does any other previous game? So far, Nintendo isn't saying. Maybe they aren't even thinking about the timeline anymore. Who knows?</p><p>While timeline speculation can be fun, it's important to remember that Zelda is a myth, or perhaps, more accurately, a legend retold over and over again, passed down across generations. While there's certainly continuity to be found, the timeline isn't as important as the series' anthology mindset and enduring spirit. You don't need to play a previous Zelda to understand a new one, and you won't need to understand where Echoes of Wisdom falls in the series' history to enjoy playing a Zelda for the first time. So by all means, speculate, but don't be surprised if Nintendo never give us an official answer as to where it falls on the timeline.</p><p>Will Borger is an IGN freelancer.

Now, it's finally headed to more platforms, and players (and South Park fans — there's a reason for this, we swear) are rejoicing.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">today's Nintendo Direct</a>, Sanrio announced that Hello Kitty Island Adventure is receiving long-awaited PC and Switch ports in 2025 (to be followed by PlayStation 4 and 5 releases at a later date), and fans have taken to X/Twitter to share their excitement.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HELLO KITTY ISLAND ADVENTURE ON THE SWITCH? god is good <a href="https://t.co/EFmhMMgzFb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/EFmhMMgzFb</a></p>— 🗡🔥 Karis 🔥🗡 (@kwehzy) <a href="https://twitter.com/kwehzy/status/1803067700324773993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i’m sorry but if i’m choosing between mario party and hello kitty island adventure that italian man will mean NOTHING to me</p>— rhys' pieces (@eyebrowpillar) <a href="https://twitter.com/eyebrowpillar/status/1803071569209479202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Other fans were happy for Butters from South Park, who predicted Hello Kitty Island Adventure in the show's iconic 2006 episode Make Love, Not Warcraft over 15 years before the game was announced. When the show's kids are plotting their next move in World of Warcraft, <a href="https://youtu.be/ho5br73xj1w?si=6c5Tf7OBDNQo1lCV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Butters says</a> that he doesn't play Warcraft and instead spends his beloved computer time playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure, which didn't exist at all at the time.</p><p>While a representative for Sanrio told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23794366/hello-kitty-island-adventure-apple-sunblink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> last year that the game's name is a coincidence and not affiliated with South Park, Butters has pretty much become inseparable from the game, and fans took to X/Twitter once again to lovingly revive the meme. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Butters, you say you play your Switch all the time."</p><p>"Yea, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventures." <a href="https://t.co/QgCmrxnDRa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QgCmrxnDRa</a></p></div>— Creepy Elliot🔜TooManyGames (@CreepyElliot) <a href="https://twitter.com/CreepyElliot/status/1803068259714920723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">me next year when Hello Kitty Island Adventure drops on the Nintendo Switch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/M3rVmdX79U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/M3rVmdX79U</a></p>— Aaron (@Hyperace) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperace/status/1803069156184502328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure combines the life simulation mechanics of Animal Crossing: New Horizons with Sanrio's colorful cast of characters and some exploration, platforming, and puzzles. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-might-be-your-next-favorite-cozy-game">previewed Hello Kitty Island Adventure's Switch port</a> before its release and said, "Fans of cozy games or someone who's looking for a fun adventure for a younger gamer should keep their eyes on Hello Kitty Island Adventure if they haven't already had a chance to play it on Apple Arcade" — despite some pretty prevalent framerate issues.</p><p><em>Amelia Zollner is a freelance writer at IGN who loves all things indie and Nintendo.

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Activision Blizzard has revealed that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a></em> will receive a <em>Fallout</em> Bundle later this week and that a crossover event will see players earn <em>Fallout</em>-themed cosmetics and additional XP as they battle to save the world in style. </p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">The <em>Call of Duty X Fallout Bundl</em>e will drop in <em>Call of Duty: MW3</em> this week on <strong>Thursday, June 20, 2024</strong>. It adds more than 15 new items to the game, and all of them are based on the <em>Fallout</em> franchise. I don’t know about you, but it takes a lot for a game to sell me on cosmetics, and having those cosmetics themed around one of my favorite universes is a great way to convince me to spend money. </p>
 <h2 id="h-worlds-collide-as-the-dwellers-from-vault-141-emerge-in-call-of-duty-mw3" data-injectable="false">Worlds collide as the Dwellers from Vault 141 emerge in <em>Call of Duty: MW3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="COD x Fallout Bundle | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Modern Warfare III" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gm2Fj9JtCZs?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">The <em>Call of Duty X Fallout Bundle</em> is almost here. When it arrives on Thursday, you’ll have access to a suite of new cosmetics that bring the <em>Fallout</em> franchise into <em>Call of Duty.</em> See below for a list of most of the items on offer in the bundle.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Four “Vault 141” Operator Skins</strong></li> <li><strong>“Atomic Disintegrator” HRM-9 Weapon Blueprint</strong></li> <li><strong>“Vault-Tec Approved” M16 Weapon Blueprint</strong></li> <li><strong>“Let’s Do This!” and “Fatman” Charms</strong></li> <li><strong>“Wasteland Workshop” Calling Card</strong></li> <li><strong>“You’re Special” Large Decal</strong></li> <li><strong>“Vault-Tec Engineer” Emblem</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola Spacer” Sticker</strong></li> <li><strong>Six Loading Screens including “Nuka-Cola,” “Please Stand By,” “Survivors’ Journey,” “Sanctuary Hills,” “Vault 141,” and “Restoring Democracy”</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">What you can see in the trailer is the “Vault-Tec Approved” M16 Weapon Blueprint, which transforms your M16 into something that Vault-Tec would definitely issue in this day and age. It’s blue, yellow, and dons the Vault 141 iconography, just in case there was any wonder where you popped up from. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">In addition to the new cosmetics, all players will be able to take part in the Fallout: Vault Dwellers Event, which arrives with the bundle. this will add new challenges for players to complete, and anyone wearing the new gear can earn additional XP for a limited time. By taking part in the event, which runs from <strong>June 20 to June 28, 2024</strong>, players can earn the following bonus items.</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>“New California Republic” Large Decal</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola Caps” Emblem</strong></li> <li><strong>“Slocum’s Joe” Sticker</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola” Charm</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola Quantum” Weapon Camo</strong></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="false">Perhaps the best part of this bundle is that it adds Vault-Tec Tracers and V.A.T.S. Death Effect to the game. These are the closest thing you’ll get to seeing V.A.T.S. in <em>Call of Duty</em>, and based on how those green bullets look in the trailer, I think they’re going to please a lot of <em>Fallout</em> fans when they arrive. Just remember that they won’t actually pause the action, and you’ve got to aim at enemy body parts manually. </p>

Ultimately, the best weapon choices for Cloud (or any character) come down to your individual playstyle. But if you want some tips on which weapons to favor for Cloud, read on.</p><h2 id="h982"><a id=""></a>It’s gotta be the Slipstream Saber, right? Not so fast</h2><p>The Slipstream Saber with its mako-infused, glowy stylings is the final sword you can acquire for Cloudy boy. And with the highest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-tips-equip-1851297272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-tips-equip-1851297272">combined materia slot</a></span> count of his swords, surely it’s the best one, right? </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-tips-equip-1851297272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-tips-equip-1851297272"><em>FF7 Rebirth</em> Materia Basics And Recommended Loadouts</a></span></p><p>Make no mistake, the Slipstream Saber is an excellent choice for repeat playthroughs, but there are reasons to choose other ones for different builds. But before we dip into those, let’s cover how and why you may want to stick to Cloud’s late-game sword. </p><p>First, the Slipstream Saber’s Attack Damage +5% weapon upgrade is an excellent boost to Cloud’s overall damage output. Combine this with Unrelenting Punisher and Formidable Counter upgrades to increase the amount of slashes you can do in Punisher mode and Punisher’s counter damage by 15-percent, respectively.</p><p>Why do you want to prioritize these boosts? Because when you combine them with the Slipstream’s three-pairs of combined materia slots, you’re dramatically expanding Cloud’s potential magic abilities (or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-assess-1851364040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-assess-1851364040">any other materia combo</a></span>) with amplified attack power by means of an OP Punisher set up. </p><p>Other blades will help you double down on either magic or physical damage, but Slipstream is exceedingly efficient at splitting the difference.</p><h2 id="h983"><a id=""></a>Smack stuff good with the Igneous Saber</h2><p>It may be a goofy-lookin’ thing, but the Igneous Saber (found in Mt. Nibel in Chapter 11) is a devastatingly powerful sword for all-out physical damage. Though they’re not all connected like in the Slipstream Saber, the Igneous Saber packs six materia slots (two connected, four solitary), so you have room to mix and match materia to either fortify Cloud’s physical stats or give him some rad spells.</p><p>For weapon upgrade slots, I recommend going with Enemy Parts Damage Up, which juices damage to individual enemy body parts (a great feature for many boss battles in <em>Rebirth</em>) in addition to Stalwart and Unrelenting Punisher to take full advantage of Cloud’s alternate battle stance.</p><h2 id="h984"><a id=""></a>Amplify Cloud’s magical talents with the Rune Blade</h2><p>If you’re looking to mix things up and send Cloud down a spellcasting path, the Rune Blade is where you want to start. Though it’s only got five materia slots (two pairs of which are combo slots), it makes up for it with the highest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434">magical damage</a></span> bonus of all of Cloud’s swords.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434"><em>FF7 Rebirth</em>’s Best Materia For Dealing Magic Damage</a></span></p><p>But a high magic stat isn’t the only thing the Rune Blade has going for it. For upgrades, we can improve Cloud’s magic damage-dealing capabilities by going with Magic Attack Power +20, ATB Charge Up (which will see him casting spells faster), and Full-Power Magic, which deals more damage when casting a spell at full MP.</p><h2 id="h985"><a id=""></a>Use abilities even faster with the Sleek Saber</h2><p>The Sleek Saber is likely to be the very first new blade you’ll unlock for Cloud as it’s found in the second chapter. Odds are it will get outpaced in terms of damage output and materia slots very quickly, but don’t be so quick to toss it. With the ability to stack two ATB Charge Rate Up upgrades (which collectively raise your ATB meter speed by 20 percent) and the Weapon Ability ATB Recovery upgrade, this is an excellent sword to use to keep Cloud dishing out ATB abilities. </p><p>I highly recommend equipping Cloud with First Strike and ATB Boost materia in combination with the Sleek Saber to get even more out of your ATB usage.</p><hr><p>With so many weapons and endless materia combinations, it’s tough to pinpoint a “best” build for Cloud. <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> is a very flexible and customizable RPG, so you can put together all manner of builds for different situations. That said, you can’t go wrong with these weapons and upgrade configurations. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been been waiting for news on the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition you don’t have to wait much longer. Ubisoft announced via social media that more information on the game is coming on Thursday, June 20 as part of the Limited Run Games Showcase.</p>



<p>The showcase starts at 2pm ET on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Looks like Uncle Pey’j has a message to share with you all… See you at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20th at 2pm EST for more news about Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition,” Ubisoft said.</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Uncle Pey'j has a message to share with you all…<br>See you at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20th at 2pm EST for more news about Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition! 👉 : <a href="https://t.co/zaLKVRlN2A">https://t.co/zaLKVRlN2A</a> Big thanks to Hubert Chevillard for this little teaser😀 <a href="https://t.co/dY2PqL2JWn">pic.twitter.com/dY2PqL2JWn</a></p>— Beyond Good and Evil 2 (@bgegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgegame/status/1803095350950949107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Recently, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20-anniversary-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies appeared online</a>. It also came after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early versions of the game</a> were accidentally shared with players. The game is expected to launch sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>“Swoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Pey’j or the valiant Double H,” the game’s description reads. </p>



<p>“Armed with her daï-jo and faithful camera, Jade’s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience.”</p>



<p>As far as Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, that game remains in limbo with no update from Ubisoft in recent years. The last we learned about the game was that its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio went through shakeups</a> with the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-still-in-early-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development struggling</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Metroid Prime 4 has finally been given a proper unveiling, now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">renamed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and with an announced release planned for 2025. With the long-awaited release finally on its way, it's worth taking a look back at the story of the other Prime games. And for more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/" data-ref-id="2900-5478">all the biggest Nintendo Direct announcements</a>.</em></p><p>It’s been more than five years now since Nintendo shockingly revealed it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">restarting development</a> on Metroid Prime 4. In that span of time, the company has announced and released two high-profile Metroid games for Switch in Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime Remastered, keeping the series in the spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Although we currently know very little about the story of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, one thing we can infer is that it will go in a different direction from previous titles. The first three installments in the Metroid Prime saga all revolved around Phazon, a mysterious radioactive substance capable of destroying the galaxy. Over the course of the original trilogy, Samus traveled to multiple planets afflicted by the mutagen to eliminate the corrupting substance and prevent it from falling into Space Pirate hands, culminating in a climactic confrontation against recurring nemesis Dark Samus on the Phazon homeworld.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Phazon saga firmly wrapped up, Metroid Prime 4 will likely pit the bounty hunter against some new galactic threat, but there are a few lingering story threads from previous games that may give us a hint as to what--or who--that could be. In the meantime, here’s a recap of the entire Metroid Prime saga up until now to refresh your memory as we await more news on Metroid Prime 4.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Spoilers for the first three Metroid Prime games follow.</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">First Encounter (Metroid Prime)</h2><p dir="ltr">Though we don’t yet know where Metroid Prime 4 will fall in the series’ timeline, the entire Metroid Prime saga thus far takes place between the first Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus.</p><p dir="ltr">The story begins shortly after the events of the original Metroid. Several months after defeating Mother Brain and halting the Space Pirates’ operations on Zebes, Samus intercepts a distress signal from a derelict frigate orbiting the planet Tallon IV. Upon arriving, she discovers the ship is actually a Space Pirate research vessel, wherein the Pirates had been conducting experiments with a strange, newly discovered mutagen known as Phazon. In the course of her investigation, Samus comes face-to-face with one of these test subjects: the Parasite Queen, a monstrous creature that escaped captivity and has been wreaking havoc aboard the frigate. Samus is able to subdue the monster, but in the process inadvertently triggers the ship’s self-destruct sequence.</p><p dir="ltr">En route back to her gunship, the bounty hunter encounters her nemesis Ridley, revived and cybernetically augmented since their confrontation on Zebes. She pursues the dragon to Tallon IV, a lush natural world once occupied by the Chozo--the highly advanced bird-like race that raised Samus and developed her Power Suit. As with the Space Pirate frigate, Samus arrives to find Tallon IV eerily deserted. The Chozo, ravaged by some unseen force, have since vanished from the planet, with only the remnants of their once great civilization left to mark their presence.</p><p dir="ltr">The murals left behind by the Chozo chronicle the arrival of a great “poison” that reached Tallon IV via meteor and seeped into the very heart of the planet. Though the Chozo did their best to contain the corrupting force within the meteor’s impact crater, their efforts were ultimately futile, and the substance--Phazon--slowly spread and decimated their civilization. Lured by the prospect of harnessing this mutagen for their own ends, the Space Pirates arrived on Tallon IV some time before Samus and established various facilities across the planet to further mine and experiment with Phazon.</p><p dir="ltr">During the course of her mission, Samus eventually gains a Phazon-enhanced Power Suit, allowing her to enter the impact crater and confront the source of the mutagen: Metroid Prime. Partway through the climactic final battle, Samus destroys Metroid Prime’s exoskeleton to reveal its core form--a nebulous being made of pure Phazon. Samus ultimately defeats the creature, but in its death throes, it latches onto and absorbs her Phazon Suit as the impact crater begins to cave in.</p><p dir="ltr">The bounty hunter flees the site before it collapses, her mission to rid the planet of its corruption finally accomplished. However, this isn’t the last she’s seen of Phazon or Metroid Prime. After Samus departs Tallon IV, the scene shifts back to the impact crater, where a hand is seen emerging from Metroid Prime’s bubbling remains--confirming the creature survived by reconstituting with the stolen Phazon Suit.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1379281116" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

receives a missive from the Galactic Federation to investigate Aether--a windswept planet on the outskirts of a neighboring star system. One month prior, a squadron of Galactic Federations soldiers was dispatched to Aether to pursue a Space Pirate vessel. However, communications with the squadron suddenly went dark, prompting the Federation to enlist Samus to locate the soldiers and render assistance.</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after arriving on Aether, Samus discovers the remains of the missing GF soldiers, slaughtered in an ambush by a pack of shadowy, interdimensional beings known as the Ing. The Ing’s ephemeral forms allow them to possess other lifeforms, including the deceased troopers, and they inhabit the fallen corpses and launch a surprise attack on Samus. The bounty hunter is able to defeat the reanimated soldiers, but soon afterward encounters a mysterious doppelganger who leads her through a strange portal, where she is once again ambushed by the Ing.</p><p dir="ltr">Having narrowly escaped the attack, Samus makes her way to the Great Temple at the heart of the planet, where she meets U-Mos, the leader of the peaceful Luminoth. U-Mos entreats Samus for her aid, explaining that Aether has suffered a similar fate as Tallon IV. Several decades ago, the planet was struck by a meteor carrying Phazon, contaminating and slowly poisoning the Luminoth’s homeworld. The impact was so great that it also caused a dimensional rift to form, cleaving Aether into two halves: a “light” world and a “dark” mirror dimension where the hostile Ing reside. The shadowy creatures have since been waging war against the Luminoth in an attempt to conquer the planet, and without Samus’s assistance, Aether will become enveloped by its dark half.</p><p dir="ltr">Complicating matters, the presence of Phazon has also drawn the attention of the Space Pirates, who have set up mining operations across Aether to extract the mutagen. As Samus travels across the planet thwarting the Space Pirates’ machinations, she once again encounters her mysterious doppelganger, Dark Samus--the reborn form of Metroid Prime. Lured to Aether by its rich Phazon deposits, Dark Samus has been ransacking the Space Pirates’ facilities and absorbing the mutagen to regain strength, leading to multiple confrontations with Samus.</p><p dir="ltr">The bounty hunter ultimately reaches the Ing’s stronghold deep in the heart of Dark Aether, where she does battle with the species’ progenitor, the Emperor Ing. After defeating the shadowy beast, she is ambushed one final time by Dark Samus, now composed purely of Phazon energy. Samus overcomes her clone and returns to her gunship before Dark Aether implodes, fulfilling her mission and restoring order to the planet. As before, however, the story does not end there. In the game’s secret ending, Dark Samus is seen reforming in space, ready to return again.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Source Of Phazon (Metroid Prime 3: Corruption)</h2><p dir="ltr">Six months after her expedition on Aether, Samus is enlisted once more by the Galactic Federation. The Federation’s Aurora Units, a network of organic supercomputers stationed across various planets, have been infected by a virus, and Samus is tasked with working alongside three other renowned bounty hunters to help cure it. Before the mission can get underway, however, the Space Pirates launch an attack on a Federation base on the planet Norion. Samus and the other hunters travel to the base and successfully thwart the Pirates, but the group are ambushed by the revived Dark Samus, who infects each of the hunters with Phazon.</p><p dir="ltr">Samus awakens one month after the attack, now outfitted with a specialized Power Suit that can utilize the Phazon coursing within her body for a temporary boost in strength. The Federation informs Samus that the Phazon-bearing meteors that struck Tallon IV and Aether were not random acts of nature, but a deliberate effort to spread Phazon across the galaxy. These living meteors, dubbed Leviathans, originated from a radioactive planet called Phaaze, and three more were recently observed hurtling toward the nearby planets Bryyo, Elysia, and the Space Pirate homeworld.</p><p dir="ltr">The other three bounty hunters, having awoken before Samus, were each dispatched to a different planet to investigate the Leviathans. However, communication with the hunters was lost several days ago, and it now falls to Samus to determine their whereabouts. As the bounty hunter travels from planet to planet, she discovers that each of her former comrades has succumbed to their Phazon corruption and gone mad. Samus has no choice but to defeat the other bounty hunters and destroy the Leviathans impacted in each of the planets, ridding them of the Phazon threat.</p><p dir="ltr">With the other Leviathans successfully dispatched, Samus travels to Phaaze for a climactic final confrontation with Dark Samus. The doppelganger fuses with the planet’s corrupted Aurora Unit, but Samus ultimately prevails, defeating Dark Samus once and for all. With the supercomputer now destroyed as well, the entire planet begins to self-destruct, eliminating Phazon from the galaxy for good.</p><p dir="ltr">However, a new threat appears to be looming in the shadows. As Samus sets off for her next destination, she’s tailed by a mysterious gunship resembling the one piloted by Sylux, one of the enemy hunters introduced in the offshoot game Metroid Prime Hunters. Very little is known about this cryptic warrior, but he harbors a deep disdain for the Galactic Federation and Samus, and his appearance in Metroid Prime 3’s secret ending suggests he may play a pivotal role in the series’ next installment.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not that will be the case. While Metroid Prime 3 ended with a tantalizing tease as to where the story could go from here, Retro Studios may well take the narrative in a different direction. As it stands, it’s currently our only hint as to what we can expect in Metroid Prime 4, but with any luck, we won’t have to wait too much longer until Nintendo finally sheds more light on the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj2y3bO-LxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yj2y3bO-LxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/18/new-playstation-portal-remote-player-system-software-update-releases-tomorrow/">announced on its PlayStation Blog</a> that a software update for its handheld remote player will allow users to connect their devices to public Wi-Fi networks that require sign-in, like free ones found at hotels and cafes.</p><p>Also in this update are new visual cues when you tap or swipe the emulated touchpad areas on the Portal’s screen and the option to see a battery percentage indicator in the top-right status bar. Up until now, the battery level was only indicated by some fairly vague bars, and the actual battery percentage number only shows when the Portal is fully turned off and charging.</p><div><figcaption><em>A battery level: how novel! Now, how about adding multiuser support?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: PlayStation</cite></p></div><p>Just as the PlayStation Portal is useless on its own (you also need your PlayStation 5 to Remote Play the games from), the new Wi-Fi sign-in won’t work without a second device. Sony indicates the Portal will generate an onscreen QR code to scan with your phone to sign in to those public networks. But hey, it’s better than being stuck at a Target while you wait for your prescription to be filled and <em>not </em>being able to get in a round of <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>The thought of playing an online shooter like that on public Wi-Fi may sound like a lag nightmare, but Sony’s blog post also shed some light on the games people are playing on the Portal — and it includes twitchy multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> in addition to PlayStation first-party staples like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5"><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></a>. </p><p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/18/new-playstation-portal-remote-player-system-software-update-releases-tomorrow/">PlayStation Blog</a> also vaguely alluded to the Portal being a surprise hit, though no sales numbers were indicated. This new public Wi-Fi feature update is likely in response to users taking their Portals outside of the home networks the handhelds were designed to be used on. Additionally, the blog post claims that Portal owners are often discovering Remote Play for the first time and that their overall PS5 game time increased within the first couple of months of Portal ownership. </p><p>That sounds to me like there’s some validity to the Portal’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17uku57/lets_go_ahead_and_nickname_this_thing_the/">unofficial moniker</a> as the “ParentStation” / “DadStation” (since freeing up the family TV for the kids makes it easier to get back to a long-dormant PS5). It’s also just further proof that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23948529/nintendo-switch-steam-deck-handheld-consoles-gaming">handhelds</a> really are so hot right now — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175149/xbox-handheld-phil-spencer-interview-2024">everybody wants them</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> just around the corner, players may be having flashbacks to the terrible congestion during <em>Endwalker</em>’s Early Access period. If you’re worried, a <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/655f2cdb22f4c473e4f34abf58e9d4042f7e3ea3">Lodestone</a> post from earlier today may ease those fears. </p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">After director and producer Naoki Yoshida explained how server congestion shouldn’t be too much of an issue this time around, something which I find difficult to believe, there may be some hope on the horizon. However, if things go as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/psa-final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-login-queues-are-in-full-force/">sideways</a> as they did during <em>Endwalker</em>’s release, there’s some advice direct from the <em>FFXIV</em> team.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">Login queues happen when a world is simply too full to accommodate all of the players who are trying to log in at once. As such, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> has implemented countermeasures to try and lessen the pain for Version 7.0. From new and probationary worlds on both <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-dynamis-dc-to-get-four-new-worlds-including-fresh-new-housing-up-for-grabs/">North American</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-new-european-data-center-to-be-added-in-preparation-for-dawntrail/">European</a> Data Centers, to opening up <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-begins-testing-cross-region-data-center-travel-later-this-month/">Cross-Region Data Center Travel</a>.</p>
 <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/all-data-centers.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">However, if your character is logged in on any other world than their home world once 7.0 maintenance begins on June 26, you may be at a disadvantage. Priority will be given to those who are attempting to log in to their home world rather than those trying to log in to any world other than their own. To prevent being locked out of the game, it’s recommended that all players return to their home world before maintenance begins.</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">If you do face a huge queue to login during Early Access, it’s advised to at least try to log in on less populated worlds, such as the new North American worlds or probationary European worlds. Failing that, all players will have the option to login on Oceanian servers by using the Cross-Region Data Center Travel option.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">Peak congestion times are expected to be 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. EST for North America and between 12 p.m. to 11 p.m. GMT for Europe, so if you can avoid trying to log in during these times, then it might be for the best. If you do manage to login earlier and hope to stay online throughout the day, you’ll need to bear in mind that you’ll be automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">It remains to be seen whether the countermeasures will have an impact on login times, or whether <em>Dawntrail</em>’s release will be subject to the same issues faced during the release of <em>Endwalker</em>. I’m hoping for an improvement, however small.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="392" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Science fiction is one of the most incredible genres in books, taking players throughout other worlds, cultures, and galaxies. Though there are some rightfully popular sci-fi books like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Ender’s Game</em>, there are also some hidden gems in the mix. These 10 most underrated sci-fi books rival the giants of the genre in terms of storytelling, world-building, characters, lore, and more.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-10-beggars-in-spain" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/QtsjEb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">10. <em>Beggars in Spain</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">Nancy Kress crafted this <a href="https://geni.us/QtsjEb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">disturbing look</a> at the future of genetic modification with a series revolving around the “Sleepless.” These Sleepless are modified to not need sleep, allowing them to put the otherwise wasted time into learning and working. Discrimination, inequality, and other familiar factors play into this fascinating sci-fi take on the year 2020. </p>

It has one of the most unique takes on first contact with aliens compared to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-thriller-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most science fiction books</a>, centering around the medically-focused space station. Rather than war or hostility, this Hospital Station acts as humanity’s peaceful attempt to connect with aliens. This leads to a refreshingly light-hearted and often funny take on sci-fi.</p>

The story starts after the near-extinction of humanity in the far future at the hands of an alien race, leading the survivors to create a religious-centric society devoid of technology. The connections between the lead characters and the rich look at the effects of manipulation on the human mind is thought-provoking.</p>

You can read this one book and have a complete, outstanding time. The story revolves around a terminally ill man who builds a time machine to cure his sickness and ends up in a futuristic utopian society. His exploration of himself and his new land is surprisingly heartwarming and character-driven. </p>

The story is told in four seemingly separate chapters from the lens of its protagonist in the midst of a post-apocalyptic world. The four sections of the protagonist’s life seem so disconnected initially but come together in a beautiful way in the finale.</p>

The townsfolk encounter aliens amidst the raging Black Death in Europe, which leads to deep science and even some intriguing ideas about how religion and aliens mix together. The more medieval-style sci-fi vibe is unmatched. </p>

Greatly affected by the loss of everyone she knows, she helps to craft a new society where everyone is detached from one another. This odd system ends up much more problematic than Miriam intended. The story of Miriam trying to fight back against her own society is riveting and reflective of the modern society we have today.</p>

However, this hides its sci-fi premise, which revolves around a 24th century corporation that finally invents time travel. The catch is it’s a one-way trip back into the past for time travelers, which leads to the invention of immortal cyborgs. These cyborgs recruit other ill-fated children to become immortal, leading to a dark, deep, and often engrossing tale. </p>

Lassti is a new planet with a race of birdlike humanoids. But when someone kills one of the key survey team members, it is up to a trader in the wrong place at the wrong time to solve the mystery. There are many layers to the core murder whodunnit and the protagonist’s often goofy mannerisms help to liven the otherwise intense story.</p>

Bunch is the progenitor of many cyberpunk and sci-fi novels today, but it remains somewhat obscure in the genre. The 1971 novel revolves around the titular city of Moderan and various short stories throughout it.

 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false">It’s worth noting that while some of these percentage chances can be quite low, each Regular and Ominous Vault will drop <strong>three to six sets of loot</strong>. This is where the Nothing item comes in, as its chance proccing means you’ll receive nothing for that set. If you proc that three times in a row, you’ll only receive three sets of loot. The loot drop can not be Nothing on the first three sets of loot.</p>

<p data-characters="220" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> sequel’s release date for Japan has been announced. Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of <em>Mario</em>, announced ahead of the Nintendo Direct that the movie will be released on April 26, 2026 in Japan.</p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false">The announcement came via a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1802869076475392024">Twitter/X post</a> where Miyamoto added, “We are working with the Illumination team to make it a fun movie, so please continue to look forward to it.”</p> <figure data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">宮本です。今晩はNintendo Directの放送がありますが、その前にひとつお知らせをさせてください。<br>スーパーマリオの新たなアニメ映画の日本での公開日が2026年4月24日に決まりました。楽しい映画になるように、イルミネーションのチームと一緒に取り組んでいますので、引き続き楽しみにしてください。</p>— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1802869076475392024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">This confirms that the <em>Mario</em> sequel will actually be released in Japan after its release in the US and other regions. Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri revealed back in March that the sequel to <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> will be released on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-april-2026-1234984594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 3, 2026</a>, in the US and other select regions.</p> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">It may not come as a surprise, given that <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was released first in the US on April 5, 2023, before releasing in Japan on April 28, 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">While plot details are still anyone’s guess, Miyamoto had <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1766816486776090984">said</a> back in March that the team is “thinking about broadening Mario’s world further, and it’ll have a bright and fun story.”</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> sequel will be directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, and the script will be written by Matthew Fogel. The movie will be co-produced by Melendandri and Miyamoto. Universal Pictures will be distributing the movie globally.</p>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">Nintendo and Illumination’s <em>Mario</em> movie was a blockbuster hit as it grossed $1.36 billion at the global box office, made a $559 million profit, and became the most successful video game movie adaptation of all time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-magic-the-gathering-set-has-me-hooked.905094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is no stranger to crossing the streams and partnering with universes outside the Forgotten Realms. Its latest foray into a new universe is the world of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, where trickery and surprise attacks are the name of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest Play Days last week, I played a round with Corey Bowen, the design lead of the set, to get a feel for <em>Magic: The Gathering – Assassin's Creed</em>. I played a Blue-Black starter deck, while he swarmed me with a Red-White deck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately I felt like the Blue-Black starter deck was the perfect way to get a feel for the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> setting. I always had a trick up my sleeve, if I had the mana prepared. It felt fitting, since that's what Ezio and his crew of protagonists are all about (well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-dual-protagonists-open-up-world-of-possibilities">maybe not Yasuke</a>).</p>

<h2>Everything Is Permitted (With Enough Mana)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One of the big mechanics with this set is Freerunning, and the Blue-Black deck especially benefits from it. If one of your creatures does direct damage to the opponent's life, certain cards in your hand can be played for a slightly cheaper mana cost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hookblade Veteran, which can fly, pairs well with this mechanic. They’re cheap creatures that have a good chance of doing small but direct life damage, opening the door for your bigger cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there's hints of the classic counter style of gameplay you'd expect from Blue-Black decks; I had no shortage of instant-cast murder or return-to-hand spells to immediately make my opponent regret spending mana on his creatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a play style I really enjoy in <em>Magic</em>, and I found it to feel even better with the options Freerunning offers. At its core, this game is all about conserving and maximizing mana use, and choosing between potential defenses or more powerful creatures is a compelling choice every time.</p>

<p>The legendary creature card in my deck was Ezio, Blade of Vengeance, a powerful assassin type with Deathtouch. Additionally, when other assassin types do direct damage, I draw a card. That really came in handy on the turn I summoned him, considering I had an empty hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, my opponent's Red-White deck was a force to be reckoned with. There's a big focus on equipment artifacts, which are based on equipment used throughout the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> franchise. For example, while my deck has a Hookblade Veteran creature, he could attach a Hookblade equipment artifact to any creature and give it flying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the late game, he had so many artifacts on the field that could turn any of his creatures into a walking nuclear bomb. I didn't even get much time to play with Ezio because he had to valiantly sacrifice himself on the opponent's next turn to one of these bombs. It's only fair though; I sent his Eivor to the graveyard with a well-timed instant spell early on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, it was a close match (though I'm sure he was going easy on me). Lots of his cards' effects whittled me down one life point at a time, though my flying creatures gradually returned the favor.</p>
<p>In the one game I played, I felt like these two starter decks complement each other extremely well. Both have some tools that disarm the other, while still carrying some powerful game-ending potential.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Art of Assassination&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-extends-to-universes-beyond-at-wizards-presents-2022"><em>Magic</em>'s first cross-over event</a>, but it was my first time experiencing one. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised and tickled by just how well the ruleset, card effects, and beautiful art matches the theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, Bowen told me about how a lot of the sneakier aspects of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> fit well into Blue and Black cards, while its more aggressive, action-oriented combat matched Red and White energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, there’s a deficit of Green cards in this set, which is unusual for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Generally, Wizards of the Coast aims for color parity for maximum balancing, especially when it comes to drafting. However, thematically, it just shook out this way for the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, many of the legendary creatures in this set play prominent roles in the Assassin’s Creed canon. For example, some are protagonists from games, while others played big roles in the story, like Leonardo Da Vinci or Cleopatra.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funny enough, Bowen told me about how Ubisoft wanted the minotaur creature card to also be legendary, since there’s only one real minotaur in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey"><em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em></a>. That’s a case where Wizards insisted that it was okay for the minotaur to not be legendary for the sake of the card game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I’m not a regular <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>player, it’s always a good time whenever I return to it. And this <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>deck is a pleasant surprise, especially if you have a soft spot for the franchise. It pairs the crisp mechanics of an all-time classic card game with the flair of a white hooded cloak.&nbsp;</p>

Chalk it up to disinterest or relative poverty, but those games were never quite my bag. Nowadays though, I’m infatuated with the genre, and not only am I trying to take in everything happening right now, but I’m desperately trying to fill in the gaps of the past. <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>’s upcoming HD-2D remake seems like a ripe opportunity to address the latter.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196452" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I recently got the opportunity to go hands-on with an early stretch of <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake </em>and, while I’m not one to comment on its faithfulness to the original, I am happy to say that it feels like a classic through and through. It isn’t without modernizations and quality-of-life tweaks that’ll enrich the experience for a new audience, but it sure as hell still feels like the genuine article.</p><p><em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>seems like the natural first choice for the “HD-2D” remake treatment of the beloved JRPG series since it marks the chronological start. The hero’s father, a legendary warrior in his own right, embarks on a quest to slay the all-powerful Beramos, but never makes it back. Eventually, the responsibility for completing this quest falls on his child, the playable hero of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, and thus does the journey begin.</p><p>With this in mind, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-dragon-quest-kingdom-hearts-1851445450&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-dragon-quest-kingdom-hearts-1851445450">Square Enix</a></span> dropped a handful of us into the early hours of the game—quite literally at level 1—as we made our way to the town of Reeve. It was a simple and short quest, but it was more than enough to give me a proper sampling of <em>Dragon Quest 3.</em> I was left wanting more.</p><p>One thing that immediately stood out to me was how immediately challenging <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>’s combat was and how tactical it<em> </em>called for me to be. I’m used to having my hand held for the opening hours of basically any game, but especially an RPG. <em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>eschews that, which feels right, as games rarely had that tendency back in 1988. Instead, I was immediately dropped onto a pretty but barren overworld replete with monster encounters that often had me threading a very careful line.</p><p>Whether it was due to my party’s relatively low MP count or a lack of any real equipment, I was forced to be tactical and precise in battle with an immediacy that’s kind of rare to find. I appreciated how <em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>didn’t treat me like I was some novice, and because of that I felt like I was forced to become a better player early on. One of my characters was a designated tank and the second they began leveling up, I started utilizing their damage-absorbing abilities more than their range of attacks. One technique pulled all aggro toward them and another deflected enemy damage onto other enemies or allies. This came in clutch at certain points in a dungeon after my main damage-dealing unit barely survived a few encounters in a row, and just needed to make it to a health-restoring level-up.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0d3e33fb3a6e9cda0e361ea2b4cb8d14" data-recommend-id="image://0d3e33fb3a6e9cda0e361ea2b4cb8d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake showing the new and improved battle screen, complete with new models for the party and monsters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake showing the new and improved battle screen, complete with new models for the party and monsters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d3e33fb3a6e9cda0e361ea2b4cb8d14" data-recommend-id="image://0d3e33fb3a6e9cda0e361ea2b4cb8d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake showing the new and improved battle screen, complete with new models for the party and monsters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In other cases, I really relished using my mage’s incredible “poof” skill, which literally makes enemies disappear. The tradeoff there was that I got fewer morsels of XP, but once again, it felt great to leverage a slew of different skills to carefully dispatch occasionally overwhelming odds. The early hours of an RPG can often be a bit dry as your characters grow in strength and eventually become distinct players on the field, but <em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>starts there, and I can only imagine where it ends.</p><p>Though the scenario I played through was hardly complex or noteworthy, it was a proper showcase of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082">HD-2D treatment</a></span> that <em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>is receiving, and that Square Enix has pioneered. I’ve had complicated feelings about the visual style in the past, where it sometimes felt like it struggled to bring anything new to a game, but here it finally felt appropriate <em>and </em>looks gorgeous. At least in this remake of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, the dioramic art style feels like a way to enshrine the legacy of this legendary title and prominently display it. According to the presentation we were treated to before our demo, the upgraded visual style also allowed the developers to better portray the range of destinations in <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, which could only be represented in pixels before. Now, the team can represent the game’s various locales in ways that more effectively reflect the real places <em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>takes influence from.</p><p>For all its faithfulness to the spirit of the original, <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake </em>does boast many of the optimizations that you might come to expect from a port or a remake of a classic RPG. Toggleable battle speeds are among the most important changes in this remake because, gosh, is that game slow as hell otherwise. You can also set the party members outside of the Hero to automatically battle on their own if you would rather focus on one character, but that just feels wrong in any RPG I play so I never bother with that setting.</p><p>My time with <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake </em>was hardly revelatory, but it was eye-opening. Its immediate familiarity, despite my never having played it before, suggests that it, and many RPGs of the same era, are the blueprints of the genre for a reason. Having finally played it now, I’m assured of why the game is spoken of with reverence, and unfortunately, I now have yet another classic RPG I desperately need to get around to. Luckily, I won’t have to wait too long, as the remake is releasing later this year on November 14, and will be followed by similar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-1-2-3-hd-2d-remake-trailer-release-date-1851546270&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-1-2-3-hd-2d-remake-trailer-release-date-1851546270">remakes of the first and second titles</a></span> in the series soon after in 2025. It seems there’s a marathon of <em>Dragon Quest </em>games in my near future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Skyline Valley is at the center of the 17th season in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-76/" data-ref-id="5000-482770">Fallout 76</a>. It features a new map region to explore, fresh cosmetics, weapons, gear, and more. However, what players will spend most of their time doing in Skyline Valley is completing the Vault 63 quest.</p><p>Vault 63 was previously locked in Fallout 76 until the Skyline Valley update came along. Now, players can complete a questline to find out the location of the vault and meet the residents inside. Below, you can see exactly how to start the Vault 63 questline in Fallout 76.</p><h2>Beginning the Vault 63 Questline in Fallout 76</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4320881-fallout76screenshot2024.06.13-11.41.52.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4320881-fallout76screenshot2024.06.13-11.41.52.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320881"></a><figcaption>Skyline Valley is unlike any other region in Appalachia. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4320881-fallout76screenshot2024.06.13-11.41.52.83.png"></figure><p>First and foremost, there is one primary requirement you need to meet before you're even able to begin the questline associated with Skyline Valley. You need to be <strong>level 25</strong> before you can receive the quest that leads to Vault 63 in Fallout 76. If you don't meet the level threshold, then you won't be able to accept or complete the Vault 63 questline. For those of you who are under level 25, I suggest playing through the main story, completing side quests, and participating in Public Events to gain XP rapidly.</p><p>Now, if you are level 25 or above, all you have to do is check the Data section of your Pip-Boy. Here, you should see a new quest called "An Unlikely Invitation," which is the first mission in the Vault 63 questline. The quest automatically appears for all players above level 25 after downloading the Skyline Valley update in Fallout 76. If you view the steps for An Unlikely Invitation, you'll see that you have to listen to the Vault-Tec Radio Broadcast to get your next task.</p><p>You can head over to the Radio tab in your Pip-Boy and select the Vault-Tec Broadcast from the list of available options. Listen to the speaker on the radio and then make sure An Unlikely Invitation is tracked from the Data tab. Once you start tracking the quest and have listened to the broadcast, you'll get a new quest marker on your map. This officially marks the start of the Vault 63 questline in Fallout 76.</p><p>The quest takes you to locations all over the map to start but then begins to hone in on Skyline Valley. After an hour or two, you'll reach the true entrance to Vault 63 and start to uncover the mystery behind Skyline Valley and the Lost enemies that populate the region. The questline takes roughly 15-20 hours to complete depending on how much time you take finishing all the quests. There are 12 total quests to complete, with "The Calm Before" quest taking place after you complete An Unlikely Invitation.</p><p>You can also check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fallout-76-everything-new-in-the-skyline-valley-update/2900-5472/" data-ref-id="2900-5472">everything the Skyline Valley update introduced</a> to Fallout 76 in our previous guide.</p>

The Motorchic suit makes Spidey look like a biker, as it wraps him up in a leather jacket, studs, and heavy-duty boots. Miles has a unique selection with his Metro suit--the puffer jacket even has web-like stitching--and the Ginga suit is described as a love letter to Brazil and soccer, which is the number one sport in that nation.</p><p>In other Spider-Man news, the Spider-Verse is growing with several new projects. Nicolas Cage will reprise his Into the Spider-Verse role for Noir, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicolas-cage-will-play-live-action-spider-man-in-new-series/1100-6523422/" data-ref-id="1100-6523422">new live-action series based on Spider-Man Noir</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-live-concert-tour-coming-this-fall/1100-6523033/" data-ref-id="1100-6523033">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Live in Concert tour</a> is coming to the US soon.

                <p>As Nvidia's stock price continues to soar, the company has now overtaken Microsoft to become the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 most valuable company on Earth</a> in terms of market capitalization.</p><p>Nvidia's $3.33 trillion in market cap is just ahead of Microsoft ($3.32 trillion) and Apple ($3.27 trillion). Google parent company Alphabet ($2.169 trillion) and Amazon ($1.90 trillion) round out the top five.</p><p>Part of what's led to Nvidia's recent success on the stock market is companies buying up its chips under the belief that artificial intelligence will play a major role in the future of the world's economy. Nvidia's stock price has climbed by more than 200% in the past year. The 3.2% increase in Nvidia's share price so far today, June 18, added more than $100 billion to the company's total market cap.</p><p>Earlier in June, Nvidia conducted a 10:1 stock split that reduced the price per share, thus making shares more affordable. Nvidia's stock price is sitting at around $135 as of this writing.</p><p>Some believe Nvidia still has a lot of growth ahead, with <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nvidia-extends-rally-as-bull-sees-valuation-nearing-5-trillion-1.2086629" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one analyst telling Bloomberg</a> the company could reach a valuation of $5 trillion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this month that generative AI could lead a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-2024-jensen-huang/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new industrial revolution.</a></p><p>"Generative AI is reshaping industries and opening new opportunities for innovation and growth," he said. "Today, we're at the cusp of a major shift in computing. The intersection of AI and accelerated computing is set to redefine the future."</p><p>While many in the business world are hyping generative AI, it remains to be seen if lawmakers could get involved to try to regulate the market amid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-is-an-extinction-level-concern-similar-to-nuclear-war-experts-warn/1100-6514645/" data-ref-id="1100-6514645">concerns by experts that AI is an extinction-level concern.</a></p><p>In the video game industry, Microsoft is pushing hard on generative AI and is working with ChatGPT company OpenAI to help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-testing-an-ai-chatbot-and-heres-how-it-could-work/1100-6522317/" data-ref-id="1100-6522317">put AI into every product it makes, including Xbox. </a>One of the many concerns around the proliferation of AI in video game development is how it could impact the people who make games. EA CEO Andrew Wilson spoke frankly on this subject recently, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">some jobs might be lost or displaced</a> due to AI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-director-says-layoffs-wont-happen-as-long-as-hes-in-charge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elden-ring-director-says-layoffs-wont-happen-as-long-as-hes-in-charge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/fromsoftware-boss-addresses-gaming-industry-layoffs-as-long-as-this-companys-my-responsibility-i-would-not-let-that-happen/">PC Gamer</a> interview done while promoting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring’s</em> <em>Shadow Of The Erdtree</em> DLC</a>, director Hidetaka Miyazaki was asked about his thoughts on the massive wave of layoffs and studio closures which has been affecting the video games industry lately.</p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">The situation is extremely dire, as even <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical acclaim</a> and a fair degree of commercial success won’t guarantee the survival of your job <em>or</em> company — even if it’s in the hands of multibillion dollar companies like Microsoft and Embracer Group.</p> <figure data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco Youtube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">Miyazaki assured fans of the <em>Souls</em> series that he’ll do whatever it takes to prevent layoffs from happening at From, stating that “at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that’s something I would not let happen. So hopefully our players and our fans can take a little bit of assurance from that”. Miyazaki even said that Kadokawa, FromSoftware’s parent company, is aware of his standing on this matter and is in tune with his ideas.</p>
 <p data-characters="748" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">The reassuring statement is exactly what fans wanted to hear, and it’s also the echoing of a sentiment by none other than Nintendo’s famed Satoru Iwata, who knew that if your objective is the creation of a great product or experience, it’s essential to unburden your workers from the dread of losing their job and livelihood. Back in 2013, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/nintendo-ceo-once-halved-salary-to-prevent-layoffs-why-thats-uncommon.html">Iwata said</a>, “If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, employee morale will decrease, and I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world” — and then backed his words by taking a massive pay cut, just so he could prevent layoffs at Nintendo. </p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">As you likely know by know, the move paid off, paving the way for the creation of the Nintendo Switch, which took Nintendo to the golden era it’s currently enjoying.</p> <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false"><em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> comes out on June 21 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
