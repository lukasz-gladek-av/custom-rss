            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has struggled a touch with its endgame pretty much since launch, but with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO's</a> next big update, Chapter 3, is promising to offer a revamp that you (yes, you! The person playing Dune: Awakening right now! Maybe!) have been after. A release date was also offered up for the big update, alongside some specifics on just what this new endgame might look like.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 is apparently set to arrive as soon as next week, February 3rd, so you've not got all that long to wait. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/541129246577262618">blog post</a> over on Steam, Funcom explained that the biggest bits of feedback regarding the endgame included the desire for more options, more rewarding ways to play, more things to do, more ways to progress player characters, and other bits, all of which will apparently be addressed in the update.
</p>
<p>
For starters, after you reach Plastanium (Tier 6), there'll be "deeper choices, shared goals, and more ways for players to continue growing." The new Specialization and Augmentation systems should allow for more in-depth progression, and there'll be 10 new locations to explore on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overland">Overland</a> Map, "including unique repeatable testing stations that feature challenging boss encounters with scaling difficulty and increasingly valuable loot."
</p>
<p>
Quite amusingly, you will also not have to pay taxes for your bases anymore! All because nobody liked it, which shows you that if we really wanted to, we could all stop paying our actual taxes too (Mr. Government I'm just goofing around, I promise). Those of you that haven't logged in in more than 28 days will also get a return package with some helpful tools too. Whether any of this is enough to bring people back or keep people happy, who knows! We'll find out soon enough in the Switter replies, I'm sure.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Is Still Falling, Falling, Falling]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911</link>
            <guid>1419148</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The decline in Xbox hardware revenue has become so predictable you could <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-bethesda-xbox-game-pass-watch-special-edition-1850527638">set your <em>Starfield</em> watch to it</a>. Microsoft reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and, yes, console sales are down yet again. But the rest of the gaming division didn’t have a such a hot holiday either. The company is blaming year-over-year declines on the lack of strong releases near the end of 2025. Hmmm.</p> <p>“Xbox content and services revenue declined 5 percent (down 6 percent CC) on a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party content performance,” reads the company’s <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/141/SlidesFY26Q2.pptx">latest earnings presentation</a>. “Xbox hardware revenue declined 32 percent.”</p>

 <p>But last year’s numbers weren’t exactly stellar. The gaming division <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-revenue-fell-7-in-q2-as-hardware-sales-dropped-29/">saw a 7 percent decline</a> overall in the second quarter. Xbox hardware was down 29 percent this time in 2025, while content and services were only up 2 percent. Holiday 2024 had <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> but was otherwise quiet.</p> <p>Holiday 2025, on the other hand, saw the release of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, while<em> Flight Sim</em> came to PS5. Also the underperforming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which, combined with a major Game Pass price hike, might have led to a spike in churn. We don’t know, though, because Microsoft still isn’t releasing new subscriber numbers.</p>

 <p>All we know for sure is that the Xbox Series X/S is an ever-shrinking part of the equation for Microsoft Gaming and the company in general. And it’s been that way <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665">almost every year</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ps5-sales-exclusivity-starfield-microsoft-1851436748">since the consoles launched</a>. The company has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-backwards-compatibility-microsoft-pc-2000644836">new hardware</a> but the priorities of the evolving Xbox platform seem to increasingly lie beyond it.</p>

 <p>With the AI arms race led by Microsoft and others spiking <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">gaming hardware costs in the near term</a>, maybe that’s for the best.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/2k-christoph-hartmann-amazon-studios-crucible-2000663900</link>
            <guid>1419112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss of Amazon Game Studios is out. VP Christoph Hartmann is leaving the company according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdisznjdh22x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>. It’s another big blow to another tech giant that once had <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-mmo-servers-rust-facepunch-amazon-2000660558">big ambitions for gaming</a>.</p> <p>Hartmann was a cofounder of 2K Games and served as the <em>BioShock</em> and <em>Borderlands</em> publisher’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">president up until he left in 2017</a>. He joined Amazon a year later to lead a range of studios working on games like the MMO <em>New World</em>, which is now set to go offline in January 2027.</p> <p>“Gaming, today’s favorite form of entertainment in the world, is connecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hartmann said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-2k-games-president-christoph-hartmann-joins-amazon-games">when joining Amazon back in 2018</a>. “Between the teams at AGS, the incredible tools and technology from AWS, the global communities of Twitch and Twitch Prime, and all of the other assets around Amazon, there are few companies in the world set up to take gaming to the next level.”</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, Amazon never managed to bring those tools together, or the other resources at its disposal, to deliver a lasting hit in the ultra-competitive gaming space. One of its projects was a 2020 hero shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazons-crucible-flopped-so-hard-its-being-un-released-1844222299">by Relentless Studios called<em> Crucible</em></a>. If you don’t remember it, that’s because a few months after its release it was “unreleased,” and eventually canceled.</p> <p>Amazon signaled it was shifting away from AAA game development last fall amid massive cuts across the company. It still hasn’t confirmed the status of a previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a>, though one of its developers said <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-lord-rings-mmo-resident-evil-switch-2-pro-controller-2000640104">the team working on it was also laid off</a>, and remains slated to publish the upcoming<em> Tomb Raider</em> games, including this year’s reboot of the original.</p>

 <p>But to the extent that Amazon is still meaningfully invested in gaming, it seems to be mostly focused on its cloud gaming platform Luna. It shifted gears last fall to focus on party games like a courtroom comedy <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-failed-game-streaming-service-luna-pivots-snoop-dogg-ai-2000630696">featuring an AI Snoop Dogg</a>. Hartmann and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Revenue Declines As Microsoft Reports FY26 Q2 Earnings]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-revenue-declines-microsoft-earnings/</link>
            <guid>1419109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft had another big quarter on paper. Xbox, however, did not.</p>



<p>In its second quarter fiscal year 2026 (FY26 Q2) earnings report, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft announced</a> a 17% year-over-over jump in revenue to <strong>$81.3 billion</strong>, with growth once again driven by cloud and AI. Microsoft Cloud revenue hit <strong>$51.5 billion</strong>, Azure jumped <strong>39%</strong>, and most of the company’s major business lines continued to trend in the right direction.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> was the clear exception.</p>







<h2 id="h-xbox-revenue-fell-across-the-board">Xbox Revenue Fell Across The Board</h2>



<p>Within Microsoft’s report, the company said that Xbox content and services revenue <strong>fell 5% year over year</strong>. Microsoft didn’t disclose specifics on the Xbox content regarding the revenue for services like Xbox Game Pass, but did say that the decline can be attributed to last year benefiting from “strong first-party content performance”. Still, the slowdown is hard to overlook as Xbox content growth continues to cool, at least for the time being. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-tops-ps5-to-lead-hardware-sales-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardware</a> was an even bigger concern.</p>



<p>Microsoft confirmed that <strong>Xbox hardware revenue dropped 32%</strong> during the quarter. As usual, the company did not provide console sales numbers or much added context, but the direction is clear. Xbox console sales continue to slide, even as Microsoft positions the brand as more of a service-driven ecosystem than a traditional hardware platform.</p>







<p>Recent quarterly data shows how quickly things have changed. Xbox content and services revenue <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-revenue-q1-2026-drop-113m-year-over-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted strong gains throughout much of FY25</a>, including multiple quarters of double-digit growth. That momentum has now faded, with FY26 Q2 marking a shift into negative territory.</p>



<p>Despite the Xbox decline for the quarter, other parts of the earnings helped soften the impact. <strong>Windows OEM and Devices revenue grew 1%</strong>, while <strong>search and news advertising rose 10%</strong>, underlining just how much Xbox is lagging behind Microsoft’s other consumer-facing businesses.</p>



<p>For Microsoft, the overall earnings picture remains strong. For Xbox, the concerns are piling up. With hardware revenue falling sharply as the Xbox Series X|S ages out and content growth seemingly slowing, Microsoft’s long-term plan for the platform is becoming a bit murkier. </p>

			<p>After <strong>Amazon</strong> went through a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">mass layoff in October 2025</a></strong>, which saw <strong>14,000+ people lose their jobs</strong>, and resulted in significant cuts to <strong>Amazon Game Studios (AGS)</strong> with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-delisted-go-offline-january-2027-amazon-game-studios/">shuttering of <strong>New World Aeternum</strong></a> and the cancellation of an upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">Lord of the Rings MMO</a></strong>, the company has confirmed it will suffer yet another mass layoff, with <strong>16,000+ people</strong> being cut this time. While it's unclear if AGS is getting hit again, a new Bloomberg report indicates that the head of AGS, <strong>Christoph Hartmann</strong>, has left the company.</p>



<p>The layoff, first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/">Reuters</a>, is said to be impacting Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and human resources divisions, and not AGS. It's also reportedly a result of Amazon leaning further towards AI technology in an attempt to push for more efficiency.</p>



<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news in a short post on his personal Bluesky account, noting it as yet another indication of Amazon moving away from its previous strategy of developing and publishing PC and console games and shifting its focus towards cloud services like <strong>Amazon Luna</strong>.</p>







<p>Hartmann has yet to directly acknowledge his departure, though the wording from Schreier's post does seem to indicate that he made the decision to leave amidst the restructuring, rather than being laid off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-founder-amazon-game-studios/">Hartmann initially joined AGS in 2018</a> and led the division throughout his tenure with the company.</p>



<p>Prior to joining Amazon, he was the founder of <strong>2K Games</strong>, making his move to join Amazon when he did a significant sign that the company was trying to acquire top industry leaders with proven success records to build this new chapter for the company, and help pave their path into the video game industry.</p>



<p>Now, nearly eight years later, it seems like Amazon has a very different plan for how it wants its presence to be felt in video games. Back in October 2025, at the beginning of the month and ahead of its last mass layoff being announced, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/">the company revealed a refresh for its Amazon Luna cloud services, even calling it a <strong>"<em>re-launch</em>,"</strong></a> as it would begin to offer an original collection of AI-powered games along with popular third-party titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>
A thing that was quite endearing, perhaps the main appeal even, about the early internet was how it was a place you could go to, with lots of other, unique places to go through, be they forums, chatrooms, or oddball social games. The last item in the list there kind of faded away for a while, replaced by MMOs and live service games like Fortnite, but these smaller scale, social-first games, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-is-a-hangout-game">hangout games</a>, are making a comeback, with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a>. And soon, for the more aquatic amongst you, there will be Coral Social Club.
</p>
<p>
On its surface (pun very much intended), Coral Social Club certainly looks like a Webfishing-esque game where simply hanging out is the main goal, with a few fun things to do along the way. It's even fish oriented! Or I guess mermaid oriented, you're a mermaid, not a fish (I do not want to get into whether a mermaid is a fish or not). In it, you can design how your merperson looks, and the main goal is to just swim about, hang out with or make friends, and sing to rescue lost fish. Which in a way is also fishing, just without the violence aspect.

<p>
That's all that's really been announced so far, apart from the fact you can blow bubbles which is cute. The main thing that I'm coming away with from this reveal is how alongside the trend of more involved affordable hangout games like Peak or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, is that there are these similarly cheap games that are even more about hanging out than the others. Webfishing, this, the recently released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3707400/OnTogether_Virtual_CoWorking/">On-Together: Virtual Co-Working</a> which is literally a game designed to be a digital social hub you hangout in while you work.
</p><p>
It feels like an interesting counter to the more dominant world of live service, which similarly has many games that could be deemed hangoutable. And it isn't lost on me that such games continue to be popular with young people in a post-lockdown world. I'm certainly curious to see where we get to hangout next! I request space, prospective video game developer. I'd like to just hang out on an asteroid, or the sun perhaps (please also provide digital sunglasses, please and thank you). You can wishlist Coral Social Club on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4321890/Coral_Social_Club/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Farming is great, but what if you also want to grind through action-RPG dungeons for cool loot? </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2295170/Emberville/"><i><span>Emberville</span></i></a><span> is seemingly the answer. The upcoming life sim is pitched as a cross between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><i> </i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392"><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i></a>. A new look at gameplay makes the formula seem pretty compelling.</p> <p><span>Earlier this week, indie studio Cygnus Cross shared the official announcement trailer for </span><i><span>Emberville</span></i><span>, which is now slated to launch in early access this summer. The announcement came alongside the reveal of some of its star-studded voice cast, which is especially exciting considering the fact that it’s a pixel art indie game. </span></p>

 <p><span>Doug Cockle (best known as Geralt from </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span>)</span><span> and Alex Jordan (who can be heard as Mr. Hands in </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>)</span><span> are on board, with Jordan also serving as the voice director. In a press release, the team also teased that it’ll be revealing a “literal all-star cast” over the next few months, which is a big promise to make after already having Geralt himself on board.</span></p>  <p><span>While </span><i><span>Emberville </span></i><span>was quietly revealed back in 2023, this week’s trailer is being called the “official” announcement. The game is set in a prison of sorts called the Vitromotus, which appears to consist of a foggy, desolate town paired with more traditional dungeon-esque areas built for combat. There’s also a…very foreboding vibe going on in the trailer (the narration promises that there will be </span><span>many</span><span> challenges).</span></p>

 <p><span>While I’m guessing that the creepier tone will persist throughout the game’s combat segments, the player’s goal is to rebuild the town through the classic life-sim gameplay elements: farming, fishing, and befriending townspeople. The trailer shows off how the town starts to take on more of a bright, classic farming sim atmosphere as you progress.</span></p>

 <p><span>At the same time, the combat system also looks pretty fleshed out. There are “challenging” bosses, a dynamic HUD that adapts to different encounters, and a skill tree where earned perks can be inherited between classes. It seems like customization is really key here, whether it’s through designing a homestead or improving the main character’s stats and abilities.</span></p> <p><span>As a </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> freak who has always wished the game had a more in-depth combat system, I’m looking forward to checking out <em>Emberville</em> (and finding out who else could possibly be part of that already wild voice cast). It’s currently slated to come to PC sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says</link>
            <guid>1419091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, the superhero workplace comedy made by Telltale veterans at AdHoc Studio, is out now on Nintendo Switch. But a number of excited new and returning players aren't super happy about the release, as it turns out the game has been pretty aggressively censored on the system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been well-known since its release on other platforms that Dispatch is a game with signficant adult content. Some characters are fully or partially naked in various scenes, with their full anatomy on display. There are some sex scenes where characters make sounds associated with sex. Sometimes characters flip the bird at one another. For those who don't want to see all this, there's a censorship toggle in the settings that covers up the nudity and the middle fingers, and silences any unwanted sex noises. On most platforms, this is entirely optional and up to the player to turn on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But not on Nintendo Switch. Earlier today, reports began to drop from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewers of the Switch version</a> that Dispatch's censorship toggle is missing from the options on the platform. That's because it's permanently turned on (no pun intended). So all the censor bars and silence are just stuck that way, with no way to turn on the more mature version of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? According to AdHoc, it's because of Nintendo policies. "Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually," the studio said in a statement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared with Eurogamer</a>. "We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has understandably frustrated some people. A number of members of Dispatch online communities in places like Reddit and other social platforms have alternatingly expressed frustration with Nintendo for its policies, and AdHoc for bending to them so readily. While it's true that other games in the past such as, notably, Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE and Fire Emblem Fates, have also been censored in various ways. But by comparison, Dispatch's censorship is extremely blunt and distracting. Who wants giant black bars across the screen? Especially if you can't turn them off?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dispatch Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more, as some have pointed out, both Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3 are on Switch too. Both of those games have nudity, and neither has been censored in such a way, leading to questions about what makes Dispatch different. We're reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch is amazing, as we determined in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review">9/10 review of the game,</a> calling it "a sharp-witted workplace comedy that charms with its smart dialogue choices, great writing, and lovably aggravating cast." You can play it without big black censor bars on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-superhero-comedy-dispatch-will-soon-no-longer-be-playstation-console-exclusive">PC or PlayStation 5</a>, but no Xbox version yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">With Daggerheart's release last year, and outings in the Age of Umbra by Critical Role and Colossus of the Drylands by Legends of Avantris, the latest Daggerheart adventure comes from New Zealand's Viva La Dirt League by way of Daggerheart Azarim.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the world of Azerim, the setting of Viva's Adventures of Azerim D&amp;D series and their skit series Epic NPC Man, this four-part mini-series picks up an adventure with 'Baradun and the Dickheads' as they get lost in a cave system using the Beast Feast campaign setting of Daggerheart.</p><p dir="ltr">As the series is already running, TechRaptor had a chance to sit down with Viva La Dirt League GM Robert Hartley to talk Daggerheart, learning while playing, and how eating food and telling stories is just about the most human thing you can do.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Daggerheart: Azarim Came To Be</h2><p dir="ltr">To begin, I was interested in hearing how the collaboration between Viva La Dirt League and Critical Role came about. As was expected of two busy production companies, this has been in the work for a long time. "We've all been fans of Critical Role for quite some time and aware of what they do as both a production company and also as content creators in general," Hartley began "I think it was about two years ago that contact first started so there was a lot of discussion for collaboration."</p><p dir="ltr">"Then Daggerheart started to come out [...] and I was really keen to try it out. For Halloween each year I do a different thing outside of D&amp;D for the Viva guys. [...] I had this idea that I wanted to do 'Honey, I shrunk the kinds' kind of thing where I shrunk their Tech Town characters and have them within the tech store. I decided I'm going to use the duality dice system [...] and so I used that without the classes of Daggerheart and I really loved it."</p><p dir="ltr">From there it wasn't a matter of 'if' but 'when' they'd play a larger game of Daggerheart. "Then [Critical Role] got in touch and said 'would you like to play Daggerheart?' and we said it was perfect timing."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Beast Feast Puts Cooking In Your TTRPG</h2><p dir="ltr">The Campaign Frame that Daggerheart: Azerim is based on is Beast Feast. Here, there is a focus on food as players can harvest different components from killed creatures to make meals that restore their HP, Stress, and Armor.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I thought it was an incredible idea of Darrington Press to include everything you would need to play in one book" - Robert Hartley</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I took a few options and said 'I'd be interested in running this, this, or this' and I pitched each [Campaign Frame] to them as the Campaign Frame is described, they've got a pitch page. Ultimately, we all decided it would be Beast Feast."</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley lamented that he feel like in D&amp;D and other TTRPG systems the downtime is often ignored or treated like filler so you don't quite get as many moments of characters around a campfire. With Beast Feast, Hartley was excited that these downtime moments were built into the gameplay. He did add that this Campaign Frame definitely wasn't for everyone as there was lifting to do on the DMs part making more systems for the cooking but that he was a huge fan of building these kinds of systems.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Playing as Baradun and the Dickheads each of the party members already had a rapport with one another, as well as powerful Dungeons &amp; Dragons character sheets so it was Hartley's job to convert them to Daggerheart.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Moving A Character Over To Daggerheart</h2><p dir="ltr">Hartley explained that in porting over the characters, recreating them in a close likeness to their D&amp;D counterparts, it was easy for the majority of characters as they had comparable classes and abilities across the system, but for characters like Greg the Onion Farmer, it was a bit harder.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking positively of the experienc,e Hartley explained it was a good way for him to throw himself into the deep end of learning Daggerheart. Additionally, it allowed him to learn each of the characters in and out and then plan a story in a way to give each player a chance to show off their skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley joked "Some people would see it as 'oh, they're forcing their GM to do all the work instead of porting their own characters over' but instead it gave me an insight."</p><p dir="ltr">"The hardest one was that in every game that I've ever played, that's trying to get Greg over. When I first started working with Viva and I was trying to introduce them to D&amp;D I already had the problem of going 'ok, I'm going to make from scratch a new Shopkeeper class'."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">From there, Hartley moved Greg to be an Artificer, but the complexity of the class didn't really match the vibes of the show, before Greg became a Cleric to focus on support. Now in Daggerheart, he was moved again to be a Seraph.</p><h2 dir="ltr">&nbsp;Learning Daggerheart Through Play</h2><p dir="ltr">An aspect I've enjoyed of Daggerheart: Azarim in the same way I enjoyed watching Legends of Avantris' Dust To Damnation is how as the game is going on the rules and mechanics are being introduced to the party with time to ask questions and understand rules.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of our unique selling points is that we are one of the more accessible actual plays. Over the years I used to get a little bit frustrated at just how long we'd played together with them still not knowing the basic rules, but one of the things that changed my mind is I started speaking to people at conventions and over and over again people said 'It's wonderful that I was able to get into D&amp;D and understand it because of the number of times you repeat the rules.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley also highlighted that this repetition of the rules is also accessible for those who are new in the space that might feel worried about having to ask those 'basic' questions.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-azarim-book.jpg?itok=asEjNyDN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Hartley explained that before going into Daggerheart: Azarim he'd provided the players with some of the absolute basics like how the dice function, their abilities, etc but planned to be teaching the rest as they played giving the players and audience the space to learn how to play Daggerheart through the adventure.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I told them what they needed to know, and I told them what was optional to know, and I left it at that"</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I did have to ask how Hartley felt when he had planned out a big adventure for these players and the first dice roll resulted in a combined 6 on the Duality Dice with a -1 modifier, and that the very next roll was a 1 and a 2 with fear, the lowest/worst Daggerheart roll you can pull off.</p><p dir="ltr">"I joked with Ben, who has the worst dice rolls. I said 'Hey man, one of the great things about Daggerheart is that there's no way to Critical Fail' [...] and he goes 'I'll find a way.'"</p><h2 dir="ltr">TTRPGs And Food</h2><p dir="ltr">Talking so much about TTRPGs and the cooking and sharing of food I was interested to learn from Hartley what his favorite snacks and food to bring to the table are. While they don't snack at the Viva table, when playing at home "there's usually bags of chips, chocolate straws, lots of biscuits, and bags of [gummy candy]. We have a rule at our game that the first person to ask 'what are we eating' needs to be in charge of picking."</p><p dir="ltr">One interesting twist at Hartley's table is that as the food is set to arrive he'll like to navigate his players to a situation where they're eating in the game as well as in real life. "As you've entered this nobles domain he invites you in to join him at the table 'please, come in, I've got some hors d'oeuvres laid out…"</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Talking deeper on the very human aspect of telling stories and sharing food Hartley also added "Storytelling is at it's heart a fundamental human thing. It's something we've been doing longer than anything else and it's why we have civilization. Other animals can communicate 'danger coming' but humans are the only ones who can communicate complex ideas to a point where we can pass down learning. Just as fundamental is sharing food as a social species. We're not all capable of hunting or gathering the food so we evolved to share the food with one another.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out Hartley, Baradun, and the Dickheads in Daggerheart: Azerim.

            <title><![CDATA[10 Tips To Know Before You Start Playing Code Vein 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/code-vein-2-tips-beginner-blood-codes-weapons-2000663875</link>
            <guid>1419061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, the sequel to Bandai Namco’s 2019 anime Soulslike, is here. While it’s pretty easy compared to other games in the genre, the bosses can still be challenging if you’re careless or don’t level up properly. </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> adds a new open world for you to explore, giving you more options to progress throughout the game. Here are some useful tips to surviving its post-apocalyptic vampiric world.</span></p> <h2>1. Ride your bike</h2> <p><span>In the opening hours of </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, you’ll obtain your bike/motorcycle that can be whipped out at almost any time when you’re out traversing the open world. It’s obviously much faster than running around, but it also has some utility. If you’re fast enough, you can ram straight through enemies, dealing a small amount of damage to them. So if you’re in an area where you just want to skip all the enemies, just hop on your bike and charge through. It also makes for a great getaway vehicle. There were some moments where I had run out of healing items and was about to die, so I pulled out the bike and simply drove away to recoup.</span></p>

 <h2>2. If you’re overwhelmed by a story boss, come back later</h2> <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>may be an easier Soulslike, but the bosses can still wreck you if you’re not prepared. However, because of </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s open-world design, if one boss is giving you a good deal of trouble, you’re free to explore other areas and tackle different bosses. Additionally, unlike in some Soulslikes that have you manually putting points into the attributes you want to strengthen, here your character gets predetermined, across-the-board stat increases as you level up. So if a boss is continually wiping the floor with you, just come back when you’re stronger, as those additional levels you’ve acquired will definitely make a difference.</span></p> <h2>3. Find health upgrades as soon as possible</h2> <p><span>There are two different health upgrades: Golden Blood Beads and Golden Nectar. The former increases the amount of health recovered when using a potion, while the latter increases how many you can carry at one time. You can find them in the open world and they’re actually indicated on the map as blue dots. Seek those out, as better recovery obviously means more survivability.</span></p>

 <h2>4. Uncover as much of the map as possible</h2> <p><span>When you first start playing </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> your map will be obscured, a result of these small red trees that act as map jammers. They’re indicated on your map as pink circles, so you can track them down and destroy them. This’ll help you get more clarity out in the world and know where to head next.</span></p>

 <h2>5. Do the side content</h2> <p><span>Doing the side content can be extremely helpful in your progression. Not only will you get stronger by defeating additional enemies, but you’ll also find new weapons, skills, and Blood Codes to experiment with. This’ll help you flesh out your builds, giving you more ways to fight enemies. Plus, if you’re looking to get all three of the game’s endings, you’ll need to finish each of the heroes’ Timeline Decision side missions.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663893" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663893"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663893">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <h2>6. Constantly swap out Blood Codes</h2> <p><span>Blood Codes act as sort of “character classes” in </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, and offer a variety of different stat bonuses and abilities tailored to specific playstyles. For example, if you like to heal, then you might gravitate toward using Holly’s Blood Code more. When you defeat enemies with a Blood Code equipped, you’ll earn EXP toward them and eventually max them out. If you take one you’ve maxed out to Lavinia in MagMell, she can extract a Booster from it, a passive skill that can further enhance your builds. So keep switching out Blood Codes to obtain even more Boosters.</span></p>

 <h2>7. Upgrade your Weapons, Bequeathed Forma, and Jail</h2> <p><span>Throughout the game, you’ll come across materials that can help strengthen your equipment, and it’s imperative that you do so. By upgrading your weapons, Forma, and Jail, you’ll increase their effectiveness, letting&nbsp;you deal more damage per hit. If you’re finding that you’re not dealing enough damage, it might be time to head back to the shopkeepers in MagMell (and across the open world) to level up your gear. The max level for your weapons and Jails is +20, while it’s +5 for you Bequeathed Forma. There are separate achievements to unlock for all three.</span></p> <h2>8. Take advantage of Item Synthesis</h2> <p><span>Materials can also be used to create helpful items outside of the typical healing potions, such as ammo for rifles and bayonets, as well as food to temporarily increase stats like defense and maximum Ichor. These items can be very helpful in a pinch during the middle of a fight, so be prepared! The game gives you eight shortcuts you can equip items to so you can use them on the fly; don’t neglect them.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663895"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663895">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <h2>9. Keep an eye on your Ichor reserves</h2> <p><span>Ichor is </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s magic point system, which can be used to execute flashy attacks called Weapon Fromae. It’s easy to get carried away and not realize that your Ichor levels are dry and you can’t use any more Formae attacks. But don’t worry! Use your Jail attack to drain enemies and replenish your Ichor. Just monitor your reserves so you don’t suddenly find yourself wondering why you can use your Formae anymore and waste precious seconds potentially getting killed.</span></p>

 <h2>10. Let your ally take the hit</h2> <p><span>One of the main reasons why </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> is easier than many other games in the genre is its NPC companion system. You’ll have a companion at all times, unless dictated otherwise by story reasons. These allies don’t cost anything and cannot be killed. This makes them perfect distractions for enemies and bosses. If your companion can draw an opponent’s aggro, that gives you the chance to heal or team up to deliver some killer blows. Don’t take your friend for granted!</span></p>

<p>Amazon’s continued distance from traditional gaming has seemingly continue. According to a new report, the head of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/amazon-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Game Studios</a> is leaving the company.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mdisznjdh22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Christoph Hartmann, Amazon Games vice president, is leaving after roughly eight years. It’s currently unknown where Hartmann is going or when he plans on wrapping up with the Seattle-based company. </p>







<p>He’s also yet to make any public comment on the matter, as of writing.</p>



<p>Under Hartmann’s leadership since 2018, Amazon Game Studios published games like Crucible, Lost Ark, New World, King of Meat, and others. Most recently, New World announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to go offline at the end</a> of January 2027. Right now, the studio has two Tomb Raider games in development along with a number of unannounced projects. Though, the status of those unannounced games remains unknown amid all the turnover.</p>



<p>Schreier added that Hartmann’s leaving comes as “Amazon continues its retreat from the PC and console video-game space in favor of its cloud gaming service Luna.”</p>







<p>Prior to joining Amazon, Hartmann spent 18 years with Take-Two Interactive. He even helped co-found 2K Games in the early 2000s after Take-Two acquired Visual Concepts. </p>

The original release had the option to censor certain explicit content from the settings menu, but the version on Nintendo platforms will censor content by default with no option to remove it. That seemingly includes brief scenes that show supervillain Toxic’s full appendage.</p> <p>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,” developer AdHoc said in a statement to <em>Eurogamer</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">prior to release</a>. “We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,” the statement continued.</p>

 <p><em>Dispatch</em> is a four-episode interactive game about reformed villains navigating their emotional baggage and personal hang-ups in a superhero call center. The workplace comedy by ex-Telltale developers also includes some adult moments, like the aforementioned Toxic dong as well as romantic scenes and explicit hand gestures. In fact, some fans have spent the last few months <a href="https://kotaku.com/devs-dispatch-telltale-superhero-game-cut-sex-scenes-romance-2000643646">wishing the game was much raunchier</a>.</p> <p>At one point a character’s areola is exposed as she’s fitting into her new costume. It’s a lighthearted throwaway gag poking fun at the genre’s silly wardrobes, and I’m guessing that moment isn’t in the Switch version either. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch#:~:text=AdHoc%20Studios'%20superhero%20narrative%20adventure,playing%20solely%20on%20Nintendo%20systems.">According to<em> NintendoLife</em></a>, a late-game sex scene has been nerfed altogether. The game’s profanity made it through, however, so you can still hear the characters swear if you want.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear what exactly Nintendo’s rules are for this kind of stuff. The <em>Dispatch</em> changes are especially weird because the Switch eShop is not otherwise shy about suggestive content. Anime sex game shovelware <a href="https://ntdeals.net/us-store/tag/sexual-content?platforms=switch">remains impossible to escape</a>. Maybe some games rated ESRB 17+ are just built different.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, following a series of layoffs and cancellations, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced</u></a> a “major organizational, operational and portfolio reset” that… will <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-layoffs-prince-of-persia-remake-canceled/"><u>lead to more layoffs and cancellations</u></a> via a 200€ million cost-cutting plan. This has not been received well by anyone; the stock market and workers, usually the fiercest of foes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shared</u></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a spit take</u></a> at what seemed to be deep self-inflicted wounds. Now, five French unions representing Ubisoft workers have called for a “massive international strike.”</p><p>The unions – CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps Écologique, Solidaires Informatique, and STJV – intend for the strike to take place from February 10-12.&nbsp;</p><p>"The announced transformation [at Ubisoft] claims to place games at the heart of its strategy, but without us, these games cannot exist," the unions wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a joint release</u></a>. "We are told about responsibilities, but those who wield this word so easily do not take any responsibility for the consequences of their catastrophic management, the latest result being the elimination of 200 jobs at Ubisoft's headquarters. We are not fooled: rather than taking financial responsibility for layoffs, they prefer to push us out by making our working conditions unbearable. It's outrageous. Our colleagues carry on, hold fast, endure, out of solidarity, out of love for the industry, and out of passion. But enough is enough!"&nbsp;</p><p>Marc Rutschlé, a Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris, said that on top of everything else, Ubisoft's plan to require workers to be in office five days per week, effectively eliminating remote work, tramples all over a deal unions made with the company last year.</p><p>“Solidaires, alongside the other unions, spent the better part of 2025 fighting for a hybrid work agreement at Ubisoft's studio in Paris, after management decided, arbitrarily, that we needed to be in the office three days a week,” Rutschlé told Aftermath. “An agreement was reached – painfully I might add – voted on by the employees, and signed in September [2025]. This agreement, while flawed, ensured that employees that lived far away would be allowed to keep their hybrid work model, and that the rest of us could request special adjustments in certain cases (familial obligations, health reasons, etc). The agreement cannot be reneged on for at least a year. However this announcement by Yves Guillemot just blew away a year of negotiations in an instant.”&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Ubisoft for additional details but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.</p><p>Guillemot’s decision, Rutschlé believes, will send ripples through Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p><p>“Hundreds of employees who felt the issue was over with are now put under an enormous amount of stress again, not knowing if their work/life balance will be compatible with Ubisoft a year from now. We do not know at this time if management will feel flexible towards some of us. All we know is that Yves Guillemot has decided, by himself, that working remotely is an issue that needs to be fixed, against the advice of everyone he's asked. And because he needs to find 200€ million for the coming year, any person who has to quit because of this is a net benefit for him.”</p><p>Rutschlé also feels like elimination of remote work is at odds with the central organizing principle of nu-Ubisoft: five “creative houses” that will each focus on specific genres and series.&nbsp;</p><p>“It also contradicts the idea that creative houses are supposed to have greater autonomy from HQ,” he said. “Why then, impose this RTO policy to everyone and not let each creative house decide by themselves?&nbsp; In short, this is a lose-lose situation for every person and every project at Ubisoft, but Yves Guillemot seems to think otherwise.”</p><p>For now, Ubisoft workers find themselves in an uncomfortable holding pattern.</p><p>“No announcement has been made regarding which games are cancelled and which are delayed, and so no one at Ubisoft at the moment knows if they will be affected or not,” Rutschlé said.</p><p>This is not the first time Ubisoft workers in France have gone on strike. In 2024, nearly 700 employees across Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot/"><u>participated in a national strike</u></a> over substandard pay – one of the largest strikes in video game history. More recently, Solidaires Informatique hosted <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/23/how-ubisoft-the-french-video-game-giant-reached-breaking-point-after-years-of-turmoil_6749735_13.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a smaller half-day strike</u></a> outside Ubisoft’s Paris office last week following Ubisoft’s reorganization announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ubisoft unions hope that February’s strike will be the largest yet, and they’re coordinating with unions outside France to present a globally united front against the company.</p><p>"We are hoping that, if enough people join us in the strike, Yves Guillemot and his team will realize that they cannot make games without us,” Rutschlé said. “Our goal is to show them that we will not be bullied into submission and that we are willing to fight for better working conditions. Our goal is to make great games again, without having to look over our shoulder constantly, wondering what the next announcement brings, and who will fall. We are sick of seeing our work conditions be degraded to a point where working at Ubisoft will become untenable.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We will not be fooled,” he added. “We see these decisions as a tactic to enact so-called 'soft-layoffs,' and we will not let it happen quietly."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-layoffs-prince-of-persia-remake-canceled/"><div><p>Following Layoffs And Cancellations, Ubisoft Announces More Layoffs And Cancellations</p><p>Sands of Time remake canceled by company regrettably incapable of rewinding time</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e69e1dd540cf3"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e69e1dd540cf3/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game over screens — as a professional gamer, you understand — aren't something that I personally have a lot of firsthand experience with. Not through a lack of in-game skill, that's for sure.</p>
<p>However, as I'm also a highly learned and incredibly hirsute scholar of the interactive arts (also a compulsive liar), I <em>have</em> made it my very important business to die on purpose many, many times in order to familiarise myself with the very best and most important ways to come-a-cropper, as they say, in a video game.</p>
<p>Now, as we all know, there are some instant talking points within this particular topic, stuff that everyone is going to bring up immediately: your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">GTA</a> 'WASTED' screen; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">FromSoftware's 'You Died'</a>; and all of the very many unpleasantly hilarious ways you can be offed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat</a> series. These are cool, but they're all a little bit obvious.</p>
<p>The same goes for that lovely Bond-styled death animation for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">GoldenEye</a> on the N64 (something that got me very excited about life back at the tail end of 1997), and all those very well-written little comments and asides from Arkham's finest criminals when Batman falls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Rocksteady's spectacular series</a>. All great ways to go, and all available to enjoy (or rage quit over) from the comfort of a Switch console, no less.</p>
<p>Today, though, instead of going with the more obvious choices, I want to pick out a bunch of the weirdest (or what I consider to be the weirdest) game over screens out there - and available to experience on Nintendo systems, if not your Switch. What are the strangest, darkest, oddest, most confusing, unusually brutal, or just-plain weird Game Overs I've seen with my poor little peepers (for research)?</p>
<p>Let's find out!</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="5759b23e8fa5f"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5759b23e8fa5f/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ZA/UM</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a> is up first here because it's sort of a cheat for this kind of list, given just how many ridiculous ways there are to get a game over screen, which is represented in-game as a newspaper clipping detailing your demise and/or downfall.</p>
<p>From ending a run because you got your tie stuck in a ceiling fan, or because a street urchin called you a slur, to taking too much psychic damage because of a romantic rejection, there's a lot to choose from. Honestly. Endless ways.</p>
<p>For me, though, the weirdest ending I've had is because I went to sleep in a dumpster. I mean, COME ON. I was tired.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body (Switch)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="b85276161d45a"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b85276161d45a/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body</a> is a terrifying game for many reasons. It's a weird one, a real oddball puzzler that had me squirming in my seat during sequences where demons are chasing me though my perverted, sweaty dreams. Or I've when I've suddenly turned into a very evil-looking goat.</p>
<p>However, it's the game over screen — which at a glance is totally unremarkable — that has stayed with me long after wrapping the game up.</p>
<p>Firstly, Vincent is lying in his pants (and they have hearts on them, cringe) in a pool of blood. Nightmarish enough, but then he also proclaims that "now's not the time to be dead" as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDLdwMI8xXU"><strong>Zigeunerweisen</strong></a> plays in the background and he resurrects.</p>
<p>What an absolute torturous nightmare of a scenario for the poor guy, a vicious circle of perverted poverty. Love is over, indeed.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan (N64)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="e51b759674685"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e51b759674685/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Eurocom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan</a>! Now what on earth is a game like this doing on a list of weird, oddball dark endings? A colourful family jaunt from the good old days that all the kids can play, as Tarzan makes his way through a lovely cartoon jungle full of friendly animaDIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! DIE TARZAN, DIE! DIEEEEEEEEEEE!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. But this is how it feels to die in this game, because the devs decided (and full marks by the way, it's a blinder of a surprise) to give us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0L9n89tJCY">a selection of game over screens</a>, the worst of which is your lifeless body being dragged away by a crocodile.</p>
<p>Yes, Tarzan, you are about to be dinner, and then toilet material. Dreadfully sorry, old chap.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie (Switch)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL</a> treats us to a wonderfully weird (and shifting) game over when we fail its tasks. No time is wasted before a very angry King of the Cosmos is shooting lasers at us whilst berating everything about us and wishing he'd chosen our stupid cousins for the mission instead.</p>
<p>Oh, and those lasers make you shrink. So be afraid.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> served up a real eye-opener with a game over screen that displays "...But The Future Refused To Change" upon death at the hands of Lavos.</p>
<p>This stark message conveys, very brutally, that the future is doomed and there's not a damn thing you can do about it now. You are dead and you have failed in the biggest way possible. Ouch!</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart (SNES)</a></h2>

<p>In the classic slice of 90s chaos, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart</a>, you play a level as Bart who has turned into pig form. Die as said pig and you'll be treated to a game over screen that sees Homer tucking into a box of corndogs.</p>
<p>He picks out one shaped as Bart, then goes ahead and eats him, quickly followed by another regular one on top. That is cold, man.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a> makes the cut here due to the sheer brutality of game over screens that see whatever character you happened to be pummelling everyone with tied to a pole. What's more, they are surrounded by dynamite which is about to explode.</p>
<p>So yeah. Punishment by being exploded. Wow.</p>
</div><div><h2>Friday the 13th (NES)</h2>

<p>This golden oldie was way ahead of its time in terms of cutting directly to the bleeding point (quite literally) by welcoming your demise with a game over screen that reads "You and your friends are dead."</p>
<p>I can tell you that, as a young child having a go at a game you probably shouldn't, that message certainly leaves an imprint.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure (N64)</a></h2>

<p>Okay, look. What if I just say, "Small pants muscle man rotating under disco lights, very small pants, sweaty...seems like it's going on in a dingy, smoky room. Please make it stop now."</p>
<p>Does that jog any memories? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/mystical_ninja_starring_goemon">Mystical Ninja/Goemon</a> games have a tradition. They've got form with these weird game over screens, but they went a step further in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure</a>, getting the game over dancer right down to a very small pair of underpants. And he's dancing.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">The Punisher</a></h2>

<p>Brutal with a capital B, you can find <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/punisher">The Punisher</a> on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Arcade Fighting Classics Collection</a> for Switch, and it's made the cut here because I have genuinely never forgotten it after having witnessed it first time in ye days of yore.</p>
<p>The scene in question involves you having CPR performed on your lifeless body by a desperate doctor as a timer counts down. Fail to continue and the doc is overcome with grief. Fairly dark stuff for a jaunt down the arcade, lads. Jeezo.</p>
