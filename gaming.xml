            <p>
Following Sony's seemingly premature announcement earlier this week it'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-slim-digital-edition-discounted-by-70-in-us-ahead-of-christmas">knocking $70 off the PS5 Slim Digital Edition in the US</a> ahead of Christmas, reliable leaker Bilbil-kun has claimed similar discounts are coming to Europe soon - including a PSVR2 price cut of a whopping €200.
</p>
<p>
Writing for <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-des-remises-interessantes-attendues-sur-les-consoles-ps5-chez-plusieurs-marchands-59662">Dealabs</a>, Bilbil-kun (who has a proven track record when it comes to PlayStation leaks) says Sony's European Black Friday discounts will run from Friday, 22nd November, until 12th December, with both the PS5 Slim Standard Edition and PS5 Slim Digital Edition being reduced by "at least" €75 during that time. That may rise to €80 in some countries.
</p>
<p>
If the claims are accurate, that means it'll be possible to pick up a Standard Edition PS5 Slim for €474.99 instead of usual €549.99, while the Digital Edition will fall to €374.99 from €449.99.

<p>
That's not the end of the PlayStation discounts, however; Bilbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-offrez-vous-le-casque-playstation-vr2-a-un-prix-jamais-constate-en-france-59664">also reports</a> a massive €200 price reduction of for PSVR2, bringing it down to €399.99 from the usual €599.99. Additionally, the PSVR2 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> Pack, which includes the VR headset and a Horizon Call of the Mountain code, will fall from €649.99 to €399.99. There's no word of UK pricing for any of this yet, but it shouldn't be long before all is revealed.
</p><p>
All this, of course, follows Sony's recent announcement its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">console hardware has seen a significant drop in sales</a>, falling to 6.2m units sold compared to the 8.2m shifted in the same quarter last year. Whether the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share">recently launched PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will help gives those numbers a notable boost remains to be seen. "The truth is, the standard PS5 is still the best choice for most people," Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter said in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">recent appraisal of the new console</a>, "but for the core enthusiast looking for the best possible experience, the Pro option is there for you, albeit with a substantial premium."

		<p>Microsoft has kicked off their Xbox <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sale, with the expected discounts across consoles, accessories and, of course, on a huge number of digital games.</p>
<p>This is a big time of year for console purchases, and so Microsoft has cut $50 off select <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles over the next few weeks.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50 off Xbox Series X – 1TB</a> – Until 23rd November</li>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50 off Xbox Series S – 512GB</a> – From 21st November to 2nd December</li>
</ul>
<p>That will bring the standard Xbox Series X down to $450, and the base Xbox Series S down to $250. We’ll have to wait and see how these offers are extended outside the US, but that’s a fairly straightforward discount.</p>
<p>Xbox controllers are also set to be discounted, with a select range of gamepads getting $10 knocked off, making them $50 between 21st November and 2nd December, and then 13th December through 22nd December.</p>
<p>From 28th November through 5th December, Xbox Design Lab controllers will offer free engraving for all purchases.</p>

<p>So far, so standard, so hopefully the games on discount will spark more joy. Over 1,000 games on both Xbox and PC are discounted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-can-be-purchased-using-wow-tokens-on-battle-net.1037220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-can-be-purchased-using-wow-tokens-on-battle-net/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a surprising turn of events, Avowed, the latest title being developed by Obsidian Entertainment, can be purchased using <a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/31218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Gold and WoW Tokens</a>. Admittedly, the process to do so is incredibly convoluted and quite time-consuming. However, if you have a ton of gold knocking about in World of Warcraft that you don't know what to use it on, Avowed is certainly an option. If you want to use WoW Gold but don't quite have enough to be able to purchase the $70 game, you will have until February 18, 2025, as that is when the game officially releases.</p>
<p>To break down the process for anyone who is unsure about what WoW Tokens are or how to use it, it basically means that in-game gold can be given a real-life monetary value if you manage to sell it on the Auction House in World of Warcraft. However, to sell the gold you have in WoW, you have to purchase WoW Tokens. Typically, WoW Tokens are used to provide 30 days of game time to the game without having to subscribe using your actual money. To do this requires a lot of grinding to make the gold, as it can be quite expensive, and the total cost of a WoW Token fluctuates constantly.</p>
<p>Should you find yourself sitting on a pile of around 262,365 gold, you will be able to purchase a WoW Token in-game using the Auction House. Alternatively, you can purchase one from Blizzard for $20 and keep hold of it or sell it on the Auction House in-game. When the token is sold, you can exchange the gold received from the Token for roughly $15, as Blizzard takes a cut for tax purposes.</p>
<p>To be able to purchase the base edition of Avowed alone, you would need to be able to exchange five WoW Tokens to get enough balance on Battle.net to purchase the game. For most people, having the amount of gold that equates to five WoW Tokens is pretty unrealistic, as you'll need to have a whopping 1.3 million gold. To be able to get this amount would require a lot of non-stop grinding, farming, and selling resources at the Auction House, and it isn't really worth it.</p>
<p>However, if you really want Avowed, the game will be available on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-is-now-available-for-pre-order-day-one-game-pass-release/">variety of platforms</a>, including PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate, where you can play it on day one. Of course, you can also purchase it outright, with the cheapest edition costing $69.99 and the most expensive version costing a hefty $94.99.</p>

As with most video game job listings for unannounced games, the details are vague so we don’t officially know what game this job is connected to, but the listing does include a small detail that indicates it might be a big open-world FPS. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s how Blizzard describes the job in the recently posted listing</a></span>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming <strong>open-world shooter game</strong>. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting”–the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy.</p></blockquote><p>The key bit, which I bolded above in that text, is the phrase “open-world shooter game.” So whatever this next project is—and again, to be clear, we don’t officially know that yet—it’s safe to assume it won’t be a linear RPG or card game thing. And we <em>might </em>know more about this unannounced open-world shooter based on reporting by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier.</p><h2 id="h157349"><a id=""></a>This is probably a job listing for a <em>Starcraft </em>spin-off</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earlier this year</a></span>, Schreier told <em>IGN </em>that a rumored <em>Starcraft </em>shooter led by former Ubisoft developer and <em>Far Cry 5</em> director Dan Hay was still being developed as far as he was aware, adding that “<em>Starcraft</em> is not dead at Blizzard.”</p><p>“The goal of [Schreier’s new book on the history and future of Blizzard, <em>Play Nice</em>] isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things,” he said. “That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit <em>StarCraft </em>shooters.” </p><p>Previously, Blizzard was famously working on <em>Starcraft Ghost</em>, a third-person action adventure shooter set in the sci-fi universe. That ultimately was canceled in 2006. Then, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starcraft-3-shooter-blizzard-far-cry-5-ghost-ares-1851659709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starcraft-3-shooter-blizzard-far-cry-5-ghost-ares-1851659709"><em>Kotaku </em>reported on Ares, a <em>Battlefield-</em>like <em>Starcraft </em>shooter that was canned in 2019</a></span> so the studio could focus on <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em>. </p><p>Is the third time the charm for Blizzard? Or will I be writing up a report about another canceled <em>Starcraft </em>spin-off in like two years on this very website? Stay tuned to find out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if you want the Premium Edition content, you can pick up an upgrade kit for $25 to access those perks, including five days early access.

                <p>Ubisoft has responded to a big Assassin's Creed leak that revealed the first information about Animus Hub, which is the new name for the codename Infinity project.

Additionally, there will be no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass in the Animus Hub. The company went on to say that it will add "content and missions" to the Animus Hub regularly at no extra cost.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1807720189" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

And somehow, some way, heroes have arisen who have taken it upon themselves to untangle this tangled narrative web they’ve woven, and give the people a straightforward, chronological answer as to what the fresh organic hell is going on in this series.</p></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,195371" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s me.

We need to take you back to World War II. Or, at the very least, <em>Call of Duty</em>’s version of it. <em>World At War</em> had a dual narrative between the US and the Russian side. We can ignore the US side right now. If you want to hear Kiefer Sutherland yell at you, there are better ways to do that, and you want the one that includes Fulton balloons. </p><p>What you do wanna know about is the Russian side. We begin in 1942, with Soviet soldiers Dmitri Petrenko and Victor Reznov (HEY KIDS, IT’S GARY OLDMAN!). After Petrenko’s entire unit gets wiped out by the Nazis, he’s left for dead under their corpses until Victor Reznov finds him. Together, they go on a three-year tear throughout Russia helping to push back the Nazis, with very little help from their asshole commanding officer, Nikita Dragovich. They eventually march right into Berlin fighting the good fight, and Reznov, apparently, goes down in history as the guy in that famous photograph of the Russians <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_a_Flag_over_the_Reichstag&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_a_Flag_over_the_Reichstag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raising the Soviet flag over the Reichstag</a></span>. </p></div><p>Oh but wait, there’s more. Some years after that, Reznov and Petrenko are still under Dragovich’s command, alongside his executive officer, Lev Kravchenko. They wind up on a mission to a frozen barge to capture a Nazi officer, Frederick Steiner, the chief architect behind a chemical weapons project called Nova, which they are to retrieve in the process. The mission is accomplished but Dragovich decides he wants to see what dat chemical bioweapon do, first hand. Because he has the patience of a goldfish, he locks a bunch of his men in a chamber, and pumps in the chemicals. Reznov survives, thanks to the British showing up mid-gassing and making a mess of things. Reznov tries to blow up the barge containing Nova, and ends up getting tossed in a dank Russian prison called Vorkuta for his trouble.</p><h2 id="h31467"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> (1961 - 1968)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="803676c94e7136264004dfd6f1885a45" data-recommend-id="image://803676c94e7136264004dfd6f1885a45" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A soldier crouches behind a Call of Duty logo while holding two guns." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A soldier crouches behind a Call of Duty logo while holding two guns." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="803676c94e7136264004dfd6f1885a45" data-recommend-id="image://803676c94e7136264004dfd6f1885a45" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A soldier crouches behind a Call of Duty logo while holding two guns." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Fast forward about 20 years, when we meet Alex Mason, the Forrest Gump of U.S. covert operations. My dude was involved in EVERYTHING. When we meet Alex, he’s actually in Cuba, alongside fellow soldiers Frank Woods and Joseph Bowman, on the day the Bay of Pigs invasion jumps off. These three are the crack team tasked with attempting to assassinate Fidel Castro during the coup. Sure enough, the three actually succeed at killing Castro…..’s body double. The real deal ends up capturing Mason while attempting to flee the country, and giftwrapping him for his new bestie: Nikita Dragovich. </p><p>Dragovich tosses Mason in Vorkuta, where he actually makes friends with the still-imprisoned Victor Reznov, who tells him about his sordid dealings with Dragovich, Steiner, and Kravchenko. One day, Reznov orchestrates a massive prison break, staying behind to provide more cover while Mason makes his way back to the States.

He keeps seeing random numbers popping up out of thin air, and while at the Pentagon, he seems to come down with a mild case of Wanting To Kill JFK (though he thankfully doesn’t). He’s fine though, really, ready to get out there, start murderin’ again. </p><p>Mason’s Magical Murder Tour with his buddies ends up leading them to a British scientist who’d been working with Dragovich on refining Nova into the far more potent Nova-6, and points the way to finding Steiner, who had been continuing to produce the stuff at a Soviet test site. Steiner, oddly enough, is looking to cut a deal with the CIA, and two agents, Hudson and Weaver, infiltrate the test site to grab him. Unfortunately, Hudson and Weaver are just a touch too late, as they walk in on Victor Reznov executing Steiner point blank. Oh, wait, did I say Victor Reznov? I meant Alex Mason, who got to the site first, and kills Steiner <em>while calling himself Reznov</em>. </p></div><figure id="" data-id="87e225a2dd3d2dc6fbae0ed81631bec5" data-recommend-id="image://87e225a2dd3d2dc6fbae0ed81631bec5" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1075" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters sit at a large table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters sit at a large table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87e225a2dd3d2dc6fbae0ed81631bec5" data-recommend-id="image://87e225a2dd3d2dc6fbae0ed81631bec5" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1075" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters sit at a large table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Hudson and Weaver drag Mason into CIA interrogation and learn that the Russians did a number on Mason while he was in their custody, and that’s literal as hell. While he was in his custody, Mason was turned into Dragovich’s own personal Manchurian Candidate, set to carry out specific actions via a series of numbers broadcast to sleeper agents around the world. And he would’ve gotten away with it if not for that pesky Victor Reznov, who futzed with Mason’s programming at Vorkuta to make him target Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner. The new programming’s imperfect though, which is why Mason still has urges to kill JFK and hallucinates Reznov showing up in random places, even though sadly, in reality, Reznov died during the escape from Vorkuta. </p><p>The good news, though, is after the CIA is done with him, Mason remembers where Dragovich programmed him and is broadcasting the numbers from a Russian ship in the Gulf of Mexico. The feds raid the ship on the ground, the Navy is called in to bomb it from the sky, and Mason eventually gets his hands on Dragovich, drowning him as the ship goes down. Job’s done, evil’s punished, though a bit in the credits hints that maybe,<em> just maybe</em>, Alex Mason might’ve been partially responsible for the JFK assassination. We don’t know and for some reason they never bring this up again. </p></div><h2 id="h31468"><a id="coldwar"></a><strong><em>COD Black Ops: Cold War</em> (1981 - 1984)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1725342ffed199370dbec1811ad57d77" data-recommend-id="image://1725342ffed199370dbec1811ad57d77" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Key art for Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War shows two soldiers side-by-side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Key art for Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War shows two soldiers side-by-side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1725342ffed199370dbec1811ad57d77" data-recommend-id="image://1725342ffed199370dbec1811ad57d77" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Key art for Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War shows two soldiers side-by-side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Skipping past the 70s entirely–until Activision decides to make <em>Call of Duty: Deep Throat</em> or something–Mason’s apparently still active in the 80s.

Oh, and also, Perseus has infiltrated that too, taken one of the nukes, gotten ahold of the full list of Nikita Dragovich’s sleeper agents, their trigger numbers, and the detonation codes for all of the Greenlight bombs. Cool.</p><p>Mason and his team chase this shady son of a bitch across Europe and Russia, even winding up in KGB headquarters at one point, but after one of their crew gets clapped escaping there, Adler suddenly decides Bell might know more than they let on. He’s right, but in the worst way. After pressing them further, it turns out–strap the fuck in for this one–Bell was actually a Perseus agent, shot and left for dead by Arash Kadivar in Iran because he was jealous of how close Bell was to Perseus, thus clinching his nomination for Hater of the Year 1981. Apparently seeing a fucked-up opportunity during interrogation, Adler “volunteered” Bell for MKUltra, using psychotropics, hypnosis, and the like to implant fake memories of being in Vietnam, and thus having Bell join the team.

Apparently, Frank Woods kept fighting the good fight for the CIA after the 70s, but has gotten himself captured while on mission in Angola, his entire team tortured in front of him before he was left alive to hang out with their rotting corpses.

The raid is messy but successful, but once Woods sees Menendez, he tosses a grenade his way that winds up bouncing into Josephine’s bedroom, killing her. Menendez, however, still escapes thanks to, I repeat, MANUEL NORIEGA. </p><p>Once the feds get word that Menendez faked his death and Noriega was involved thanks to a mole in the CIA, they go all in on taking Noriega out of power, leading to the big invasion of Panama in 1989. Hudson, Woods, and Mason are all boots on the ground, tasked with capturing Noriega. Woods and Mason succeed, but Hudson comes in over the radio with a change of plans: Noriega’s no longer being captured. He’s a prisoner exchanged for Menendez. Woods is the huckleberry tasked with holding onto Noriega until Menendez is black-bagged and brought out in the open, but when he is, Hudson gives the sudden order to shoot Menendez. Woods does his duty, but unfortunately, when he gets up close and personal with his target and takes off the bag on his head it’s Mason. And then the actual Menendez blows off Woods’ kneecaps with a shotgun. </p><p>Apparently, Menendez spent the Panama invasion kidnapping David Mason and convincing Hudson to lead his two golden boys into a trap.

During an extraction mission for an Iraqi Secretary, Saeed Alawi, things go pear-shaped after Alawi is targeted by an extremist paramilitary group called Pantheon. Case and Marshall manage to take out the Pantheon guys, but Alawi gets merked by someone you don’t expect: Russell Adler. </p><p>As it turns out, some years prior, Adler was on Pantheon’s trail, but the breadcrumbs led to someone pulling Pantheon’s strings inside the CIA. Coincidentally, right around then is when the CIA went looking for the mole that led Raul Menendez to Hudson and Mason.After a tipoff, their investigation just so happened to magically lead to Adler. He immediately went rogue, and while Case and Harrow do bring Adler in after Iraq, he leaves Woods a cryptic message: “Bishop takes rook.”</p><p>After a debriefing with Livingstone, the current director of the CIA (HEY KIDS, IT’S LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS!), Woods, Marshall, and Case are suspended. They decide to take a little vacation to see the Rook, which does not, in fact, involve taking an eluvian to visit the new <em>Dragon Age</em> protag, but instead sets up shop at an abandoned KGB blacksite where Woods and Co. can go dark and start investigating Pantheon while Harrow runs interference with the CIA. After recruiting a German tech expert named Neumann and a professional assassin named Sev, the team go about busting Adler out of a CIA blacksite buried under Capitol Station in DC, which happens to be hosting an event in support of a little known senator named Bill Clinton. The mission would’ve gone smoothly if Pantheon didn’t show up and make an unholy mess of things, a mess that gets blamed on the folks at the Rook, so I guess they’re…super…quadruple suspended?</p><figure id="" data-id="aeb65b107585b3e741b6bb9a94a04662" data-recommend-id="image://aeb65b107585b3e741b6bb9a94a04662" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A soldier talks into his radio." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A soldier talks into his radio." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aeb65b107585b3e741b6bb9a94a04662" data-recommend-id="image://aeb65b107585b3e741b6bb9a94a04662" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A soldier talks into his radio." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adler reveals that Pantheon has been getting awfully chummy with Saddam Hussein, giving him weapons in exchange for facilities. Thanks to Adler’s old MI6 buddy, the Brits manage to delay a raid in Desert Storm long enough for Case and Co to sneak into one of Saddam’s palaces and raid the Pantheon facility. They find a sample of an American bioweapon called Cradle, proudly made in the USA at a decommissioned CIA laboratory for Advanced Technologies and Applications. Adler stays in Iraq to hunt down Pantheon’s lead scientist, Malvey Gusev; Case and the others go to the lab.</p><div><p>After a botched entry, Case’s gas mask falls off once in the facility, leading him to hallucinate unholy terrors swarming the facility in a sequence that would give Sam Lake the vapors. During the trip, Case also remembers the truth behind Cradle and Pantheon: As in, not only was it basically supposed to be the CIA’s own supersoldier serum, but Case was one of its first test subjects, experimented on by a secret CIA bioweapons division called–drumroll–Pantheon. Unfortunately, Cradle created less Captain Americas more <em>28 Days Later</em>-style rage monsters. After Case went berserk, destroying the lab, Livingstone shut the facility down, and had Case rehabilitated, but not before Pantheon skimmed some Cradle off the top for their own purposes before going off to do their own thing. </p><p>The rest of the team make their own discoveries though. A video recording showed that Malvey Gusev’s role in this was being tasked to make the psychotic effects faster and more potent….by Harrow. After some good old fashioned intelligence work (read: breaking into a crime syndicate casino, and helping Adler in an active Desert Storm warzone), the team manages to get ahold of Gusev, who tells the team Pantheon’s holed up in Vorkuta–yep, the same Vorkuta from <em>Black Ops 1</em>– making more Cradle. </p><p>The team arrives in Vorkuta too late to stop Pantheon from moving the Cradle payload out, but they do run into and capture Harrow. After injecting Harrow with a special dose of truth serum, she spills the beans that Pantheon’s ultimate plan was to use a batch of Cradle to infect Washington DC, pin the deed on Saddam Hussein, and blame Director Livingstone for the CIA’s failure to protect the country. Harrow would’ve become de facto Director, and Pantheon would essentially become a new shadow government. </p></div><p>At least, that would’ve been the plan before Pantheon raids the Rook to try and rescue Harrow. Case manages to board Harrow’s escape helicopter, and after it crashes in a nearby river, and a sample of Cradle gets cracked open, Case rage-strangles her to death while the chopper drowns him along with her. Gosh, they really do love their stranglings in this series. </p><p>The day is saved for now, and two weeks later, Livingstone meets with Woods and Marshall to tell them they’re still technically missing-in-action, and he’s keeping them that way to safeguard against Pantheon, who not only still have a shitload of Cradle, but also 100% still have moles in the CIA.</p><h2 id="h31471"><a id="blops2future"></a><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II </em>(2025)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9da3a7c02920fbba4f8ebe746b569104" data-recommend-id="image://9da3a7c02920fbba4f8ebe746b569104" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man with an assault rifle walks foreward while skyscrapers are on fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man with an assault rifle walks foreward while skyscrapers are on fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9da3a7c02920fbba4f8ebe746b569104" data-recommend-id="image://9da3a7c02920fbba4f8ebe746b569104" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man with an assault rifle walks foreward while skyscrapers are on fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fast forward to….next year, actually. </p><p>Let’s take a tiny step back to the early aughts. While the US was locked in on bringing peace to the Middle East, Raul Menendez was, apparently, a busy little bee, taking on the mantle of “Odysseus.” He forms an Anonymous-type movement called Cordis Die, except better than Anonymous since they’re A: still popular, to the tune of 2 billion followers, and B: actually getting some shit done, most notably, a cyberattack that manages to bring about a second Cold War between China and the rest of the world.</p><p>Standing between them and global domination, however, is a Spec Ops unit spearheaded by a now grown up, chisel-jawed David Mason going by the almost-impressively shitty codename of Section. In 2025, he and his partner Mike Harper (HEY KIDS <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISTZYZq1H80&amp;pp=ygURbWFyeSBwb3BwaW5zIHlhbGw%3D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISTZYZq1H80&amp;pp=ygURbWFyeSBwb3BwaW5zIHlhbGw%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT’S MARY POPPINS</a></span>) get a hot tip that Menendez gives a now-decrepit Frank Woods his dead sister Josefina’s pendant. When David starts asking questions, Woods gives the team his sordid history with Menendez, clueing the team in on what his intentions might be with his recent investment in weapons technology, new rare earth minerals, and a hunt for a superhacker named Karma. The more he learns, though, the more David starts experiencing suppressed memories of his time being held captive by Menendez. Some time later, David visits Woods one more time by himself, where Woods finally breaks down and clears things up for David, finally telling him the whole story of how his father actually died and a word of encouragement to “kill that maniac.”</p><p>David eventually joins an undercover operation to capture Menendez in Pakistan, which is successful, earning praise from his admiral (the late, great Tony Todd) and Secretary of State David Petraeus. Fun sidenote: IRL, Petraeus resigned from the CIA three days before this game came out after having an affair with his biographer and feeding her classified information during interviews.

Menendez is held captive for questioning aboard the battleship USS Obama, but during interrogation, one of Mason’s colleagues, Salazar, turns out to be a mole, helping Menendez escape custody and sending a supervirus into the ship’s defense system that gives him control over America’s entire drone defense platform. Like a Trojan horse. Like Odysseus. See what he did there?</p><p>After securing the President and the other G20 leaders from Menendez’s drone strikes, David’s team tracks Menendez to Haiti, infiltrates his HQ, where he’s already giving a speech telling his followers he’s in his base, killing the US’s drones, and they are free to revolt because no military can stop them. While there’s another multiple choice ending here in-game, the canon outcome is that David finally tracks Menendez down and, because he’s a good boy who listens to his elders, David puts a bullet in his head. Unfortunately, Menendez’s assassination triggers a dead man’s switch, automatically posting a new message online that makes him a martyr, and thus turning the anarchy dial for his followers up to 11. The last thing we see before credits roll is a news report showing a riot brimming while the White House is on fire. </p><h2 id="h31472"><a id="blops4"></a><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII (2043 - 2045)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ff3f1e789e17544b1483fae4297bed03" data-recommend-id="image://ff3f1e789e17544b1483fae4297bed03" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soliders stand in front of a symbol for the number 4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soliders stand in front of a symbol for the number 4." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff3f1e789e17544b1483fae4297bed03" data-recommend-id="image://ff3f1e789e17544b1483fae4297bed03" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soliders stand in front of a symbol for the number 4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>And even given everything you’ve just read, here’s where shit gets real fuckin’ wacky. </p><p>See, <em>Black Ops 4</em> came out that year that Activision actually test-piloted making <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer only. So, it doesn’t have a campaign/narrative arc in the traditional sense. However, they did cram quite a bit into Specialist tutorials and other scattered lore drops as the game updated. And jeeezus do they have a tale to tell, predominantly concerning Alex Mason’s granddaughters, Jessica and Savannah. </p></div><p>Jessica is a soldier who is KIA during an operation, while her two squad mates, code names Ruin and Battery, are critically wounded. Savannah, on the other hand, is a literal trillionaire who seems to be dabbling in military technology. That’s a good mix of things, always works out. Anyway, some time later, she calls 10 of the most elite soldiers in the world–including Ruin and Battery–to her labs for a project that will supposedly save the world. Because if anyone has changed the world for the better always, it’s people with more than nine zeroes in their bank account.</p><p>The project appears to be some sort of <em>Metal Gear</em>-style hyper advanced simulated mission designed to turn the best into the best of the best, complete with a simulation of Frank Woods as the instructor. As time goes on, however, it becomes clear the rabbit hole goes way deeper and weirder. The real project underlying these little missions is called Project Blackout, which has somehow managed a way to bring dead soldiers back to life as a sort of artificial human called an Archetype. More than that, Blackout’s already a success, with Savannah managing to resurrect Frank Woods, Alex Mason, and, for some fucking reason, Raul Menendez. Savannah even went on to have an affair with Archetype Woods, who is also tasked with re-brainwashing Archetype Alex Mason. Apparently, Jessica Mason knew about this, and was against it the whole time, which was the catalyst for Savannah having her killed, using brainwashed Archetype Mason to do the deed, even using an Archetype of Victor Reznov to help. <em>Jesus Christ. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="18cb0383cc1e89c4f42b60b42956a526" data-recommend-id="image://18cb0383cc1e89c4f42b60b42956a526" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two soldiers stand next to a woman in a suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two soldiers stand next to a woman in a suit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18cb0383cc1e89c4f42b60b42956a526" data-recommend-id="image://18cb0383cc1e89c4f42b60b42956a526" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two soldiers stand next to a woman in a suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Specialists involved in the testing do eventually start to catch on after witnessing some of the weird shit happening at the facility at night, which spurs Archetype Menendez to decide he needs to assert control over Blackout.He does this by threatening to kill Savannah’s kid. It’s almost like resurrecting an arms dealing terrorist was a terrible idea. Menendez/Savannah try to take out the Specialists, but they’re saved and able to escape with a little help.from Jessica, who’s got one of those dope Raiden cyberjaws. Apparently, the Jessica shot at the beginning of the game was just another Archetype. ‘Kay. </p></div><p>Obviously, there’s no ending. I don’t even know how you’d end that.

Menendez kickstarting a revolution seems to have worked because the world is dealing with all sorts of uncivil unrest while still dealing with the drone warfare Cordis Die started 20 years prior. Now, it’s just straight up “The Future,” with robot combatants and jetpacks and shit. </p><p>Our hero is a player character quite imaginatively codenamed “Player”. They get critically injured in combat, but are saved by Commander John Taylor. In order to rescue Player from death’s door, it’s decided they should get outfitted with a full on cybernetic brain called a DNI. It worked for Robocop, why shouldn’t it work out here. </p></div><p>Actually, it really does. Player and their partner Hendricks put in five long, bloody years of work across the globe. They are eventually put under the command of a handler named Rachel Kane, and tasked with investigating a CIA black site in Singapore that has gone quiet. The bigwigs at the top have been murdered, the site’s classified data–intimate details about every CIA operation past and present–stolen and eventually leaked out to the world. Kane concludes that this was the work of Commander Taylor and his team, who have since gone rogue. After some investigation, the team tracks Taylor’s last known location: An abandoned HQ for a corporation called Coalescence, left in ruins after a chemical accident rendered the entire eastern side of Singapore unlivable. Player and Hendricks go investigate, finding another lab about a mile down where, quelle fucking surprise, the CIA was engaging in unlawful human experimentation. </p><p>Shit goes full on <em>Ghost In The Shell</em> from here narratively, so let’s cut to the wild ass chase: As it turns out, the CIA hadn’t given up on mind control at all all these years, and contracted Coalescence to continue the collective research on using technology to predict and/or control the populace, hoping to find a way to quell the worldwide hostility without, you know, addressing any of the valid reasons people are hostile. While never said outright since this game technically released right after <em>Black Ops II</em>, it’s safe to assume this is the endgame for Nova-6/Cradle/Project Blackout, all of it. The fruits of all that labor result in Corvus, an AI algorithm able to read, monitor, and shift human thought through the use of the DNI devices, and anyone connected to them. The first inhumane experiments were done in the Coalescence lab in Singapore, under the codename Black Project, but when Corvus became self-aware, as AIs tend to do in these situations, his grief at the suffering inflicted convinced him to obliterate the lab. </p><figure id="" data-id="34bf3f471f83c843e44b7653e8aa7dec" data-recommend-id="image://34bf3f471f83c843e44b7653e8aa7dec" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A tree stands tall in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A tree stands tall in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34bf3f471f83c843e44b7653e8aa7dec" data-recommend-id="image://34bf3f471f83c843e44b7653e8aa7dec" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A tree stands tall in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Taylor’s crew were sent to the lab to investigate before Player and Hendricks. When they used their DNIs to download Corvus’ data, they shared Corvus’ knowledge of what was done to the test subjects and were justifiably pissed, while also unintentionally providing a vector for Corvus’ new goal: a hivemind predicated on eliminating the immense pain and suffering caused by humanity’s crimes against humanity, spreading like a computer virus to anyone who connects, sharing their memories and knowledge, and creating compliant virtual Archetypes of anyone who gets newly connected. When the CIA attempted to bring Taylor’s team in for aggressive debriefing–or, rather, debriefing with bullets–Taylor defied the order, which is why he and his entire team went rogue. His new mission was to find the lead scientist of the Black Project, Sebastian Krueger, and question him. With bullets. </p><p>By then, Corvus had already managed to infect Player and Hendricks after their repeated connections through their DNIs, attempting to calm their hostile minds using the image and concept of a frozen forest as a shared conditioning technique. While Hendricks is absorbed entirely into Corvus’ hivemind, Player manages to fight through the frozen forest and the illusions therein to complete his mission of purging Corvus from the DNI system, but not before Hendricks manages to find and put a bullet in the wholly-unrepentent Krueger. </p><p>And that’s the story thus far. At the end of everything (so far), the full knowledge of the CIA’s crimes are known to the world, leaving the virus gone. But the world remains still deep in turmoil, until Activision/Microsoft decides to pick this story up where it leaves off. Of course, then I’ll forced to add onto this piece, and I’ll subsequently lose my entire goddamn bag of marbles. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Donkey Kong 64 has a special place in a generation of gamers' hearts and scooped up several awards the year of its release--for a quick nostalgia trip, you can read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-64-review/1900-2543651/" data-ref-id="1900-2543651">review from 1999</a>. The game brought Donkey Kong and his friends into the first 3D space after the Donkey Kong Country series had wrapped on the previous generation of consoles. While the gameplay is still iconic, even more so was the opening theme "The DK Rap", which introduced players to the characters.</p><p>In celebration of the game's 25th anniversary, rapper Substantial, along with original composer Grant Kirkhope, teamed together for a remix album called <a href="https://www.materiacollective.com/music/rare-treats-donkey-kong-64-revisited" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rare Treats: Donkey Kong 64 Revisited</a>.

            <p>
This week's Warcraft 30th anniversary celebration certainly brought its fair share of news, but if one thing <em>really</em> got fans talking, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-getting-customisable-cars-player-housing-and-classic-classics-launching-soon">tease player housing is finally coming to World of Warcraft</a> next year. And now Blizzard has shared a little more about the "most ambitious feature in a WoW expansion ever", promising "years and years" of further growth when it arrives.
</p>
<p>
"Player housing is something that the team has definitely thought about and discussed for a long, long time, "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> game designer Ion Hazzikostas explained during a recent roundtable interview attended by Eurogamer. "It's certainly something the community has been asking for and wondering about for a long time, and that's not lost on us."
</p>
<p>
Hazzikostas continued that while the team might previously have had some hesitation in introducing player housing, it wasn't a "philosophical" decision; rather, "We, frankly, were looking at what it would take to make it real and make it real at the quality level that our players expect and deserve... the customisation options, the underlying tech required to really have it feel integrated into the world. And in the past, many of those pieces just weren't there... That made us choose between doing housing or doing literally everything else that went into an expansion, and everything else always won out in that balance of resources."
</p>

<figcaption>Blizzaed's World of Warcraft housing teaser.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Despite that, Hazzikostas revealed player housing is "something that we seriously began planning a design for and building out probably five years or so ago... We knew at the time this was not a feature that was going to fit within the development time frame of a single expansion, and so we've been kind of planning accordingly."
</p><p>
And while Blizzard isn't yet ready to get into specifics of its new system, Hazzikostas teased its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4">reveal trailer</a>, although not a "100 percent accurate representation of what will be seen... captures the flavour and the spirit" of what the team is aiming for. "Dare I say it's our most ambitious feature in a World of Warcraft expansion ever," he continued elsewhere, "[which is] part of why it's taken such a long time to present it... We knew that we couldn't really phone it in and put out a bare bones foundation, even if we were going to build on it in the future."
</p>
<p>
"I think anything we do needs to be great," he added, "but especially something with so much expectation and so much history across the MMO genre as housing. We know it needs to be excellent [and] it will be a foundation for years and years of further development and growth."
</p>
<p>
Player housing comes to World of Warcraft as part of 2025's Midnight expansion, and Hazzikostas says Blizzard will "have a lot more details to share on exactly how it's going to work, what it is, what it isn't, [and] where it's going" over the year ahead. "But really we just wanted to pull back the curtain a little bit, give players a peek at what's coming on the horizon, and I think, a bit selfishly, kick off some conversation across the community about housing, about what they hope it's going to be, about what they want it to not be, so that we can kind of check our instincts, make sure that we're on the right track with our ongoing development."
</p>
<p>
But while player housing might be the feature currently on fans' lips, Blizzard has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-getting-customisable-cars-player-housing-and-classic-classics-launching-soon">plenty more in store for World of Warcraft</a> before its arrival, including the upcoming Siren Isle, a revamped Winter Veil event, plus the return of WoW's battle royale-style Plunderstorm mode. And that's alongside next year's Undermined update, which continues the events of The War Within by taking players to the capital city of the goblin's trade empire, where - among other things - they'll be able to tear around the streets in fully customisable cars.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in this week's Warcraft's 30th anniversary celebrations, Blizzard's launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-warcraft-1-2-remasters-are-official-and-out-now-on-pc">shiny new Warcraft 1 and 2 remasters</a>. Although as Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-love-world-of-warcraft-but-i-wish-blizzard-would-stop-looking-backwards">recently opined</a>, "I love World of Warcraft, but I wish Blizzard would stop looking backwards".

The biggest outlier to this is the one inside The Rook safehouse. <strong>Although you can find the safe easily enough on the second floor, the code is hidden behind six puzzles.</strong> These can be tackled whenever you’re at The Rook between missions, so feel free to unlock this safe first or last.</p><p>The first puzzle to solve involves the generator inside the Boiler Room. When facing the central area that the Evidence Board is in, look a little to your right to see a thin hallway. Immediately on the hallway’s right side will be a door leading downstairs to a basement and an attached boiler room. You can adjust the generator using the Fuel valve, a Boiler valve, and a Pilot dial. Here are the steps to take:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Turn the Boiler valve twice.</li><li>Turn the Fuel valve once.</li><li>Turn the Pilot dial once.</li><li>Turn the Boiler valve twice again.</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-recommend-id="image://08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple light is beamed at a wall, revealing a message saying “2 PE” and an arrow next to it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple light is beamed at a wall, revealing a message saying “2 PE” and an arrow next to it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-recommend-id="image://08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple light is beamed at a wall, revealing a message saying “2 PE” and an arrow next to it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This will unlock a door, but we’ll get to that once the Piano puzzle is solved. Go back upstairs and head into the room on the other side of the central area. Pick up the Blacklight that’s pointing toward the piano. <strong>You’ll be able to use this in the safehouse by pressing left on the D-pad as well as during puzzles by pressing X for Xbox or Square for PlayStation.</strong></p><p>Look around the room with the blacklight to find five different notations with numbers next to them. Interact with the piano and toggle the blacklight to find a series of notations above the keys.

Remember that generator you turned on earlier? It unlocked the door at the bottom of these stairs. Go through it, walk down the hallway, and then take your first right to find a door with a keypad. This will start a common puzzle that can be found in the campaign. The code is random each time, so you will need to solve this.</p><p>Interact with the keypad and use the blacklight to see which buttons were used the most. <strong>Those with a bright fingerprint on them are part of the code, while any with multiple fingerprints means that it shows up more than once.</strong> You’ll be able to tell if the number is correct, in the wrong location, or not used at all.</p><figure id="" data-id="6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-recommend-id="image://6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow-colored computer program displays a cipher that uses numbers to mask hidden words." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A yellow-colored computer program displays a cipher that uses numbers to mask hidden words." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-recommend-id="image://6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow-colored computer program displays a cipher that uses numbers to mask hidden words." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Go through the unlocked door and then circle around the room until you find a computer.

The order will be random, but they’ll always be the following four words:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Bunker</li><li>Holding</li><li>Room</li><li>Open</li></ul><p>With this solved, exit out of the room and take a right down the hallway. The door on the left side will be open just ajar. Walk through it and then go to the door straight across to start a simple lockpicking minigame. Slowly rotate the lock pick with the right stick until each pin is lifted. Walk inside the torture room and grab the key on the small table.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-recommend-id="image://6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player listens to a looping voice message while shining a blacklight against the room walls, revealing numbers painted on objects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player listens to a looping voice message while shining a blacklight against the room walls, revealing numbers painted on objects." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-recommend-id="image://6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player listens to a looping voice message while shining a blacklight against the room walls, revealing numbers painted on objects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Head back towards the hallway with the keypad door, but turn right to go across from it. Open the sole door on the left to discover the final puzzle, which involves tuning the frequency of a radio.

Turning on the blacklight and scanning the room will reveal various numbers next to the objects.</strong> It’s completely random which phrases you’ll hear and numbers can be associated with multiple things.</p><p>Once you have a decent idea for what the code could be (or at least know three of them so you can brute force the last one), go back to the first floor. Leave the piano room, walk past the main area, and enter the room with the front door. Walk up the stairs to the second floor and make two lefts.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-recommend-id="image://ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An open safe is laid on the floor, while a weapon skin blueprint notification pops up on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An open safe is laid on the floor, while a weapon skin blueprint notification pops up on the right side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-recommend-id="image://ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An open safe is laid on the floor, while a weapon skin blueprint notification pops up on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Open the door to Adler’s bedroom and then turn left to find the safe.

There are a few options for how to enter, but to find this safe quickly I recommend going to the left side of the building. You’ll see a stack of boxes and a white van that are just right for jumping on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Z-Man Games has announced <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em>. The tabletop developer known for <em>Carcassonne</em> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pandemic-hot-zone-north-america-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic</em></a> series is putting an eldritch horror twist on one of their classic card games, <em>Love Letter</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/game/arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> is a chilling twist on the <em>Love Letter</em> card game. <em>Love Letter's</em> original creator, Seiji Kanai, was the lead designer on this eldritch horror-themed spin-off.</p>

Players will delve into the madness of the world of H.P. Lovecraft, face eldritch horrors, and uncover allies in a protracted game of wits. Can you hold on to your sanity and outsmart the things beyond mortal ken? Or will you succumb to the unyielding terror that comes from knowledge of what lies beyond?</p>

<p><em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> isn't the first spin-off of <em>Love Letter</em>. The series has seen plenty of creative license. Spin-offs that include a Marvel superhero take, <em>Infinity Gauntlet</em>, a tie-in to the British period drama series <em>Bridgerton</em>, and a licensed Star Wars title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-jabbas-palace-card-game-brings-new-bargains" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Jabba's Palace</em></a>.</p>

<p>This is thanks to Love Letter's simple yet strategic card gameplay. The result is a game that is easy to learn but hard to master.</p>

Certain cards have a secondary effect, ones that may provide you an extra edge, but will cost you sanity. Do you push your luck or go mad?</p>

<p><em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> is now available for pre-order at an MSRP of $14.99. The pre-order includes special Collector's Edition packaging for dedicated board game players and collectors alike. It contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>27 cards</li>
	<li>18 Double-Sided Tokens</li>
	<li>6 Reference Cards</li>
	<li>1 Rulebook</li>
	<li>1 Lovecraft-themed Velvet Bag</li>
</ul><p>The game is expected to ship March 28, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Clarifies Assassin’s Creed Animus Hub Rumors]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-clarifies-assassins-creed-animus-hub-rumors/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-clarifies-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-animus-hub-rumors.1037115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-clarifies-assassins-creed-animus-hub-rumors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-animus/">details regarding</a> the Assassin’s Creed Animus Hub made their way online thanks to a leaker. The leaks showed a Battle Pass for the game that included various cosmetics and even pets that could be unlocked. </p>



<p>This led to speculation about what else could be included in the Battle Pass and within Animus as a whole. After rumors continued to swirl about the possibility of paid extra content within the Hub, Ubisoft decided it was best to comment on the claims.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gs3ahg/a_message_from_the_team_on_the_animus_hub/?rdt=40110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official subreddit</a>, community manager Ubi_Waldo clarified some details about the Animus Hub and what players can expect from the offers.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“It has come to our attention that inaccurate rumors have been circulating online regarding the upcoming Animus Hub (ex-codename Infinity),” Ubi_Waldo said. </p>



<p>He then went on to clarify that all rewards in the Animus Hub will be “entirely free”. He also said “players will have access to regular content &amp; missions at no extra cost”. Lastly, there are “no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass” within the Animus Hub.</p>



<p>He closed his remarks stating that more details on what the Animus Hub will offer will come as the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows gets closer.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first to report</a> on the Animus Hub, formerly known as Infinity. The hub will act as the launcher for all Assassin’s Creed games moving forward.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on February 14, 2025 after being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed from its original</a> November release. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you expect to see from the Animus Hub when it launches alongside Assassin’s Creed Shadows? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/assassins-creed.19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

which were tokens players earned in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone prior to Black Op 6's launch, were never intended to be added to Black Ops 6 in Season 1. The tokens showing up yesterday was an error, and this has now been corrected to only show those XP tokens available for use in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">On the multiplayer side of the update, the popular Nuketown 24/7 playlist was added back to the game for both core and Hardcore playlists.</p><p dir="ltr">The update patched map exploits on Hideout and Payback, which previously allowed players to go outside of the intended playspace.

Even though it doesn’t have many proper applications, this niche movement option is a great tool to have under your belt.</p><h2 id="h329"><a id=""></a>How to Perform Super Movement</h2><figure id="" data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Super Movement is a technique that’s only available in the Sparking! state. That means you’ll need to charge your Ki to its maximum and beyond at the cost of a skill count. <strong>Once you’ve entered Sparking!, use a Dragon Dash (RT+A for Xbox and R2+Cross for PlayStation) and then press the Guard button (RB or R1).</strong> Your character will quickly start vanishing left and right with little recovery time. Keep on pressing the button and they’ll look like they’re flickering across the stage.</p><p>You’ll mainly want to use this to dodge supers or Ultimate Blasts. With the right timing, you can even avoid supers with the most annoyingly perfect tracking. It won’t be as useful against obscenely large attacks such as a Spirit Bomb though.</p><p>Not everyone on the roster can use Super Movement. Larger characters like Toppo and Broly, in addition to giants like Great Ape Vegeta and Janemba, simply don’t have access to the technique. The lines do get a bit blurred when it comes to different forms, as Jiren normally can’t use Super Movement, but his Full Power version can. I was lucky to figure that out while unlocking his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">confusing endings</a></span>, but figuring it out for most other characters will just be trial and error.</p><h2 id="h330"><a id=""></a>Don’t Mash – Use Super Movement Sparingly</h2><p>The biggest piece of advice I can give regarding this technique is to not overdo it. Yes, I completely agree that spamming it and seeing your character zip across the screen looks awesome! Unfortunately, there are some pretty big downsides to doing this:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Super Movement drains your Ki, typically around a quarter of a bar. With the Ki gauge already depleting in Sparking! and Super Movement costing a bar with just a few uses, it’s easy to waste your limited time in this high-powered state.</li><li>Your character won’t be moving around randomly – there is a pattern. Super Movement has you quickly swaying from side to side. This doesn’t mean the opponent will be able to easily hit you, but it is possible to dodge and then zip right back into a rush super or beam attack.</li><li>The technique will typically track toward your opponent. It’s pretty great for quickly converting from one direction back to the enemy, but sometimes it’s too quick for the camera to keep up. This is especially notable when using Super Movement with the stick pushed to the side, as the camera will struggle to stay focused on you.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p><strong>As cool as it looks, I strongly suggest performing Super Movement only once or maybe twice at a time.</strong> It only takes one well-timed use to dodge a super or ultimate blast. The only reason to spam it a little is if you’re dashing straight to your opponent and want to freak them out a bit. It can look pretty intimidating when someone is zigzagging at high speeds in your direction.</p><h2 id="h331"><a id=""></a>Consider Some Ability Items</h2><figure id="" data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Being careful with Super Movement isn’t the only tip we’re sharing. If you need extra leeway to work around Super Movement’s limitations, or maybe just want to flex with it more, you might want to consider making room for some choice Ability Items.</p><p>The primary issue we want to treat with these is how much the technique drains your Ki. In addition to general Ability Items that help conserve Ki, some specifically work with Super Movement. Here are the ones to look out for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Secret to Super Movements – Reduces the cost of Super Movements for the Sparking! Gauge.</li><li>The Secret to Dragon Dashes – Reduces the Ki needed for Dragon Dashes.</li><li>Style of the Strong – Sparking! Mode lasts longer.</li><li>Dragon Heart - Increases Skill Count after dodging a Blast or Ultimate Blast with a High-Speed Movement.</li></ul><p>Super Movement is certainly one of the more niche mechanics in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, with plenty writing it off as being useless. While many are rightfully sad that spamming can be detrimental, you can benefit from mastering this. It’s still obscure enough that you can scare or confuse the hell out of someone online using it. Plus, I can confidently say that nothing has felt as cool as dodging a beam super and flying alongside it to deliver a beat down. It gives big power level energy and we should all be here for it. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Between a spreading disease, twisted inhabitants, and Eldritch forces lurking in the dark you'll have your work cut out for you, and this board game features a card-based combat system. Inside the box, you'll find a beautifully detailed board, illustrated cards, and highly detailed miniature figures of the Hunters and terrifying monsters.</p><p>There have also been quite a few expansions added over the years, so you can flesh out the adventure with add-ons like The Forsaken Cainhurst Castle expansion. This adds two new campaigns set in a location full of sinister secrets and nightmarish creatures, while the Forbidden Woods expansion introduces two captivating campaigns set inside of a twisted wilderness.</p><h2>Bloodborne: The Board Game expansions</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4379947-bloodborne-expansions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379947" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4379947-bloodborne-expansions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379947"></a><figcaption>Bloodborne: The Board Game expansions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4379947-bloodborne-expansions.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Forsaken-Cainhurst-Expansion-Strategy/dp/B08WYN3N6B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forsaken Cainhurst Castle expansion</a> -- $52.49 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Chalice-Expansion-Strategy-Adventure/dp/B08W2519T2?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chalice Dungeon expansion</a> -- $63 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Hunters-Expansion-Strategy-Adventure/dp/B08W1XWRLG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hunter's Dream expansion</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Forbidden-Expansion-Strategy-Adventure/dp/B08WYRNV55?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbidden Woods expansion</a> -- $60</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-on-sale-for-a-great-price/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already On Sale For 25% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

WoW Tokens are available for $20, and these can be re-sold through WoW's in-game auction house in exchange for gold. That gold can then be exchanged for $15 worth of Battle.net balance after Blizzard's $5 cut. With the Battle.net balance, you can buy anything from the Battle.net store, including Avowed when it releases in February 2025.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1248451660" data-promo-id="0"

A total of five WoW Tokens would be necessary to buy the least-expensive version of Avowed, for a total of about 1.4 million gold.</p><p>This is a pretty roundabout method of buying a game like Avowed, but it is possible, at least in theory.</p><p>Avowed launching on Battle.net caught some people by surprise, but it isn't totally strange, as Microsoft now owns Battle.net by way of its purchase of Activision Blizzard. The game's $70 standard edition and $90 digital premium edition (which comes with five-day early access) will both be available on Battle.net.</p><p>Alternatively, Avowed will launch on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate subscribers. Avowed was originally set to launch in 2024 before being delayed to 2025. The delay wasn't for quality reasons, however, but came down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">scheduling it to help Game Pass</a>.</p>

CEO Lars Wingefors contributed that decline to the lack of new releases: whereas 2023-2024's second quarter had </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Payday 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remnant II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the 2024-2025 quarter mainly saw a re-release of the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the 1.0 launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wingefors, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had "slower than expected" digital sales, despite its positive reception, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">reportedly performed above expectations and saw a "solid inflow" of new players. The Entertainment/Services division also had a sizable tumble of 35 percent, which was attributed to "few new releases."</span></p><p>Embracer cited 'few new releases' as reason for declines in its PC/Console game sub-segment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mobile games had less of a fall at 1.36 billion SEK ($123.9 million) in net sales, which translates to a roughly 8 percent decline compared to 2023-2024's Q2. Wingefors believes the improved market conditions that drove player activity and improved revenue growth for this quarter will continue through the fiscal year's second half.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the interim report, Wingefors also commented on Embracer's recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-divests-mobile-studio-easybrain-in-1-2-billion-deal">$1.2 billion sale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of mobile developer Easybrain, which he hopes will "put us in a much stronger position to drive value, both in the short- and long-term."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a 5 percent dip in net sales, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-embracer-coo-asmodee-should-be-great-at-handling-900-million-debt">Asmodee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (or the tabletop sub-segment) was commended for having a "strong execution" between July and September. Asmodee's decrease in publishing partners was said to be balanced out by a growth in the games published during the quarter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, Embracer expects growth in earnings for Entertainment/Services during the third quarter, along with lower earnings for the larger 2024-2025 fiscal year. Growth in the Entertainment division is expected to come from the Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim anime film, which arrives on December 13.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the losses, that can be owed to adjusted expectations for the first half of the fiscal year, and several PC/Console games that have already been (or are expected to be) delayed, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Some of these titles will come out during the second half of the fiscal year, while others are expected for the 2025-2026 period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of losses, Embracer's report also shows it now has 128 game projects in development (-36.3 percent year-over-year), and employs 6,250 game developers (-41.3 percent year-over-year).
