<p>NetEase has announced that the Advanced Suit 2.0 is coming to Marvel Rivals to celebrate the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The company posted a reveal on Twitter earlier today, stating that the suit will be available for Spider-Man from January 30.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friendly-neighbourhood-spider-man">Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), NetEase wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Take the first look at Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (2023) in Marvel Rivals, the Advanced Suit 2.0 blends Otto Octavius’s science with Peter Parker’s genius. Crafted for the toughest battles, it symbolizes Spider-Man’s true grit as a hero.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the reveal image used to showcase the Advanced Suit 2.0 in Marvel Rivals:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Spider-Man 2 was released in 2023 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and while Insomniac neglected to follow up with any major expansions, the game has remained popular since. On January 30, the web-slinging hero title will land on PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been a boon for NetEase since being released in December 2024. It has pulled in tens of millions of players and has become one of the best hero shooters to emerge in recent years. It’s challenging Overwatch in the genre and will be a thorn in the side of Valve’s Deadlock.</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals, Spider-Man is one of the most challenging Duelists. He has a five-star difficulty rating and relies on unparalleled acrobatic abilities to dominate the playing field.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of Spider-Man 2, you’ll want to snag the Advanced Suit 2.0 when it appears in Marvel Rivals on January 30.</p>

<p>In a recent update posted on Steam, it was revealed that Fortune’s Run, a retro sci-fi indie shooter, will have all development activity put on hold for three years. This is because the sole developer, ‘Dizzie’, will be serving a 36-month prison sentence, which was handed down as a result of the dev living ‘a very different life’ before they started working on Fortune’s Run.</p>



<p>As of today, Fortune’s Run boasts a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam, where it has existed since September 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-unclear-what-will-happen">‘It’s Unclear What Will Happen’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on Valve’s PC platform, Steam, the sole developer of Fortune’s Run explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been sentenced to prison for the next 3 years. It’s a long story, but I’ve lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn’t living very well. My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month. </p>



<p>It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post went on to explain that Fortune’s Run ‘sold okay’ and that once Dizzie is released from prison, they’ll hopefully be back on their feet and will return to the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I’m never going to stop making games. I’d like to finish this one, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news was followed up by a couple more posts explaining some updates and tweaks being made to the game – which will likely be the final changes Fortune’s Run will see for quite some time.</p>



<p>If you want to ‘explore a decaying industrial world left behind in humanity’s never-ending race to conquer the stars’, then consider giving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692240/Fortunes_Run/">Fortune’s Run a try on Steam</a>.</p>

In this post, we're rounding up everything you need to know.</p><p>In addition to The Witcher remake, CD Projekt is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel,</a> a new Witcher game codenamed Project Sirius, and a new IP codenamed Project Hadar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260" data-ratio="0.55088495575221" data-width="904" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260"></a><figcaption>The Witcher is getting a remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png"></figure><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_">When will The Witcher remake be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_"><strong>When will The Witcher remake be released?</strong></h2><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced The Witcher remake in October 2022</a>, and there is no word on a release date as of yet.</p><h2 id="Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</h2><p>Preorders for The Witcher remake are not open yet, but it can be assumed that players will be able to eventually order the game from CD Projekt's own GOG store in addition to a variety of other destinations.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, CD Projekt has not released any official trailers for The Witcher remake.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</h2><p>CD Projekt has not announced any platforms for The Witcher remake, but PC seems to be a given, while it is expected the game will also come to console platforms.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Witcher remake is a new version of the game "rebuilt from the ground up."

A number of Fool's Theory staffers previously worked at CD Projekt on the original Witcher game. CD Projekt Red is providing "full creative supervision."</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</h2><p>A key difference between the original Witcher and the remake is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-fully-open-world-unlike-the-original/1100-6509525/" data-ref-id="1100-6509525">the remake will be fully open-world</a>. Not only was the first Witcher game presented in a more linear fashion, the sequel, Assassins of Kings, was as well. These games featured large open zones players could explore. However, progressing the story past certain key points would move players to a new zone, closing off the previous area entirely. The series didn't go fully open world until 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>According to Jakub Rokosz, who heads up the remake's developer, Fool's Theory, parts of The Witcher that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-remove-simply-bad-and-outdated-elements/1100-6520729/" data-ref-id="1100-6520729">outdated or are "simply bad" will be removed.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-remake-dev-pledges-to-remove-the-parts-that-are-simply-bad-and-i-think-i-know-whats-first-on-the-chopping-block/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Rokosz said that "first and foremost, we need an honest, down-to-earth analysis of which parts are simply bad, outdated, and need to be remade," but these changes will be done while "highlighting the parts that are great, should be retained, or are direct key pillars that can't be discarded" for the remake.</p><p>Some fans have already begun predicting which elements will be sent to the chopping block. Obvious changes include the dated combat and traversal systems, while online, fans are speculating that Geralt's infamous "Romance Cards" won't be included in the remake either.</p>

And now, dozens of movies later, a new report claims that one of the villains from that very first<em> Iron Man</em> film, Raza, is returning in a new MCU TV show. Are you excited? Do you even remember Raza? Well, it doesn’t matter; he’s back, baby! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/01/faran-tahir-marvel-vision-series-disney-plus-1236257063/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/faran-tahir-marvel-vision-series-disney-plus-1236257063/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On January 14, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that its sources had confirmed that actor Faran Tahir was set to appear in the upcoming Paul Bettany-led <em>Vision Quest</em> series.

<p>Activision has revealed its new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies map that will launch at the start of Season 2. The new map is called The Tomb, and will release for all Zombies players on January 28.</p>



<p>“After surviving the horrific events at Citadelle des Morts, Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya follow Gabriel Krafft’s final words to a nearby excavation site to secure the Sentinel Artifact,” the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post reads</a>. “Built on the remains of ancient burial grounds with suspected origins dating back to 2500 B.C.E., these catacombs went undisturbed for centuries until the early 1900s… and what lies beneath may run deeper than anyone ever imagined.”</p>



<p>Developer Treyarch says that The Tomb was designed to give players an experience similar to that of Liberty Falls. The map has “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”. There will also be Easter Eggs scattered throughout the map along with a “reimagined Wonder Weapon” that is inspired by the past.</p>



<p>“As a reminder, every Zombies map in&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;is an original location built from the ground-up for the mode… but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a wink and a nod here and there,” they said. “On that note, we’re going for something a little more evocative with our Pack-a-Punch camos this time around – and what if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?”</p>



<p>In addition to the new map, Zombies will be getting a number of updates with the launch of Season 2. Those updates include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Challenge Tracking &amp; Near Completion</li>



<li>Co-op Pausing</li>



<li>AFK Kick Loadout Recovery</li>



<li>Separate HUD presets for Zombies and Multiplayer.</li>
</ul>



<p>More details on The Tomb and what else is coming to Zombies will be revealed in the upcoming Season 2 reveal blog.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gi-joe-battle-for-the-arctic-circle-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For children of the '80s, few rivalries are as nostalgic as the one between G.I. Joe and Cobra, with their high-tech vehicles, creative codenames, and the red and blue lasers their weapons shot. For longtime board game players, the Axis &amp; Allies series of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> may hold a similar nostalgia with its large amounts of miniatures, its emphasis on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>, and tense <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice rolls</a>, all set among the height of World War II. Now under the care of Renegade Game Studios, Axis &amp; Allies are letting players experience the confrontations between the Joes and Cobra in the new G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic (minus the colorful lasers, unfortunately).</p><div catalogid="dd241838-99b5-4b20-adc7-ccc3128f3649" id="214115"><div id="214115" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>G.I. Joe: Battle for The Arctic Circle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle for the Arctic Circle puts up to four players in the boots of either G.I. Joe (playing as Keelhaul and Snow Job) or Cobra (as Destro and Cobra Commander) in a battle to control the North Pole, as both sides vie for control of points around the map and establish their hold on the Arctic Circle. From the moment you open the box, it’s clear that the goal of this game is to give the younger and more inexperienced audience a fun and interesting on-ramp to the wider world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review">Axis &amp; Allies</a> offerings, and I think the team at Renegade Game Studios succeeds.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battle for the Arctic Circle is a far less imposing beast for new players to tackle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Popping off the box lid, I was greeted with the familiar small plastic miniatures and the other usual accouterments of an A&amp;A title, just with a G.I. Joe flair. For fans who have played previous versions of Axis &amp; Allies, you will feel right at home here. Turns are still broken up the same way – you buy new units at the beginning of your turn, have your separate combat move and non-combat move phases, and battles with their attacker vs. defender rolls are all still here – but everything is just a bit more condensed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The number of miniatures is rather small, meaning players won’t need to contend with managing massive armies around the map or rolling for giant battles. With a smaller map, you won’t be earning large amounts of Reinforcement Points (Arctic Circle’s equivalent of IPCs in other A&amp;A games) to buy more units, and along with other subtle tweaks, Battle for the Arctic Circle is a far less imposing beast for new players to tackle. That said, this game does have some entirely unique mechanics and tweaks that also set it apart, some of which I enjoyed more than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a first for the A&amp;A series, Battle for the Arctic Circle abandons the real-world geographical boundaries separating areas and uses hexes, a decision that works out really well. I appreciate the real-world borders in the previous games from an immersion sense, but they are also one of the biggest issues I have with the other editions, where everything can just start feeling cramped – an issue I was happy to say I didn't encounter here. While this is also due in part to having fewer units to contend with overall, there is no denying that the larger, uniform hex spaces played a role too. I wouldn't complain if Renegade adopts this method in future games as well (something more likely to happen in future spin-off games like Battle for the Arctic Circle than mainline games, to be fair).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition unique to this G.I. Joe variant of A&amp;A comes in the form of the diabolic “Weather Dominator” device that the Cobra forces have access to on their turns. This dastardly piece of machinery, for the cost of a single RP, can turn a single non-land-only hex into an ice-covered tile that can be traversed by land units. This is a neat feature, and it proves to be incredibly important to use as Cobra to try to quickly capture nearby victory point tiles. Cobra starts with a significantly lower amount of RP to spend each turn, so using the Dominator to score some early points is a must. I really like the concept of it as well; a weather-controlling device being used by the bad guys is a quintessential ’80s cartoon story trope, and I’m here for it. To keep things fair, the Joes can use their cruiser ships to try and break up the ice, which can lead to some rather unfortunate situations where Cobra units are stranded in enemy territory without backup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest change are the unique commander powers that each player gets. While there are fewer armies to take command of in this game (only four as opposed to the more common five or six armies in the mainline A&amp;A games), each commander has a special ability that can be triggered if the correct conditions are met. Once a turn after damage is assigned, for example, Cobra Commander can sacrifice his own units to deal additional hits to the enemy (yes, Cobra Commander has kamikaze units). Snow Job's commander power grants their land units an additional space of movement during their non-combat movement phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In principle, I enjoy these unique powers, but I also found them not to all be created equally, with the Joes' powers being far more usable than Cobra’s – especially Destro’s. In Destro’s case, he gains a bonus whenever he attacks a Joe-controlled tile that contains six or more units, a scenario I perhaps encountered only once or twice during all my plays of the game. Had the ability applied when he was defending as well, it would be far more reliable or impactful. However, considering Destro has to attack to gain the bonus, it made the ability rarely used, which made playing as Destro less exciting than the others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I like the idea of the commanders having special abilities, adding a slight asymmetrical component, but the balancing of the skills currently on offer felt lacking. I wish that each side had additional commanders to choose from, with teams being able to pick only two to use. Regardlessy, the whole thing is a neat idea and a fun mix-up within the A&amp;A system that I would like to see carried over into future spin-off titles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXvNm?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjXV4?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Target</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXb4G?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/avXmx2?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Hasbro Pulse</strong></a><strong></strong></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/akRW76?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Renegade Store</strong></a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2025 6:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Battle for the Arctic Circle does a commendable job of presenting the systems of Axis &amp; Allies in a way that will be far more approachable for younger, new players while also giving those individuals a great on-ramp to the larger A&amp;A series. It also provides an option for those intrigued by the longtime war game franchise but turned off by the subject matter, giving them a solid war game without the historical complications. In both cases, I think GI Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle is a fun game to add to your collection. 

That said, outside of pure nostalgia for the Joes, I don't think there is much here for longtime A&amp;A players or for board game hobbyists looking for a deep war game that doesn’t necessarily fit into those cases mentioned above. For that group, I'd recommend either Axis &amp; Allies 1941 as an excellent jumping-in point or the Anniversary Edition for a great all-day wargaming affair. Regardless, while G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle may not be for me, I appreciate the value it offers new and younger players to get their first taste of this series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> reveal on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/">imminent horizon</a>, Nintendo finds itself at a critical juncture. Every console launch is a pivotal moment for a company, but that's especially true for Nintendo. The first Switch proved to be a remarkable rebound from the disastrous Wii U, becoming one of the best-selling video game consoles in history over the last eight years.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, Nintendo is undoubtedly facing a lot of pressure to maintain this momentum with its next console. And while it's tempting to compare this transition with the move from Wii to Wii U, the company's current situation more closely resembles the position it was in as it prepared to launch the 3DS--itself the successor to a hugely successful and influential system.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, 14 years ago this week, Nintendo hosted a media event in New York detailing its launch plans for the 3DS. Though the company had publicly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gut-reactions-nintendo-3ds-e3-2010/1100-6266572/">unveiled the handheld a few months prior at E3 2010</a>, it withheld some key details--including the system's release date, price, and launch lineup--until this January event. In hindsight, however, the reveal offered a glimpse at a rough road ahead for the platform--missteps that Nintendo will want to avoid repeating when it finally launches the Switch 2.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Meager Launch Lineup</h3><p dir="ltr">The first indication of trouble could be gleaned from the system's launch lineup. Although Nintendo had announced some exciting titles for the 3DS at E3--including a remake of the beloved Ocarina of Time, new entries in the Animal Crossing and Mario Kart franchises, and a long-awaited Kid Icarus revival--none of these would be available on day one. In fact, most would not arrive until several months after the system launched.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Nintendo pushed the 3DS out to market alongside a handful of amusing but slight built-in applications like Face Raiders, as well as three minor titles: Nintendogs + Cats, Pilotwings Resort, and submarine sim Steel Diver. Without a marquee first-party release to accompany the system, it fell to third parties to fill in the gap. Their offerings, however, were not much more enticing, with a port of the years-old Street Fighter IV garnering the most attention.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, the handheld struggled to attract an audience right from the outset. As novel as the 3DS hardware itself was, the system hit the market without a true "must-have" game to convince players to upgrade, and many ended up waiting before finally purchasing one--a situation Nintendo will no doubt want to avoid repeating when it's finally ready to launch the Switch 2.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="316093893" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

dir="ltr">Price</h3><p dir="ltr">Another crucial miscalculation on Nintendo's part was the system's price tag. By 2011, the final iteration of the Nintendo DS line, the DSi XL, was on the market for $170. Given the way Nintendo historically priced its handhelds, most industry watchers expected the 3DS to launch in the vicinity of $200. However, the final price would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-3ds-and-historical-handheld-pricing/1100-6286318/">much higher</a>. Nintendo surprised many when it announced the 3DS would retail for $250--$80 more than the DSi XL.</p><p dir="ltr">Without experiencing the 3DS in person, it was difficult for consumers to square the steep price tag. The system's defining feature--glasses-free stereoscopic 3D effects--could not be adequately conveyed to prospective buyers without getting the handheld into their hands and having them witness it for themselves (and even then, the feature’s novelty was arguably not as enticing as Nintendo hoped and would eventually be phased out in later iterations of the platform). Moreover, the early launch games, while a clear step up from the DS in terms of graphical fidelity, were not exactly visual showpieces for the handheld, making it difficult for Nintendo to justify the system's price to consumers.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Missing Features</h3><p dir="ltr">The final warning sign from the press event was the 3DS's features--or lack thereof. Although the system was poised to launch in March, its digital storefront, the Nintendo eShop, would not go live until June 2011: three full months later. Moreover, though Nintendo had touted the system's ability to play 3D movies back at E3, it had no further news to share about this feature during the January press event, which gave the impression the company was rushing the handheld out to market before it was ready.</p><p dir="ltr">Taken together, these three missteps set the 3DS on a rocky path, and the system limped out of the gate when it launched that March. Sales were so worrying that Nintendo took the unprecedented step of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-slashes-3ds-prices/1100-6325850/">slashing the system's price</a> by an eye-popping $80 USD in July, less than six months into its lifetime. (To further illustrate just how shocking this move was, the Nintendo Switch still has yet to receive an official price cut, nearly eight years into its life.) As a make-good to early adopters who did pony up the original asking price, the company also distributed an unexpectedly generous gift as part of an “<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-more-3ds-ambassador-games-named/1100-6331880/">Ambassador Program</a>”: 20 free NES and Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games.</p><p dir="ltr">This drastic course-correction had the intended effect, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/price-cut-saves-3ds-4-million-sold-in-u-s-in-2011/">3DS sales rebounded</a>. By the time Nintendo stopped supporting the platform in 2019, the entire 3DS line had sold almost 76 million units--a respectable amount, but less than half of the 154 million units the original DS line moved. It's difficult to say whether or not the system would have sold much more over its lifetime had it had a smoother launch, but it's clear that early stumbles are difficult to correct, and most platforms never fully recover from a rocky start.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is undoubtedly aware of these pitfalls, having gone through many successful (and not so successful) hardware launches over its long history. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">repeatedly stressed</a> the need to ensure Switch owners can "smoothly transition" to the console's successor, citing the Nintendo Account system as an integral component of this strategy. Like the 3DS, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/">Switch 2 will also be backwards compatible</a> with its predecessor. Nintendo has already confirmed the new system will play original Switch games, guaranteeing it has a deep library right from the outset (especially with major Switch 1 titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> still on the way later this year).</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the similar circumstances it finds itself in, Nintendo is in a better position than it was when the 3DS launched. For one, every public statement indicates Nintendo will treat the Switch 2 as a continuation rather than a fresh start, as it has traditionally done when launching a new platform. To date, every system Nintendo has released has featured a distinct online service and storefront, which meant the company was continually starting from scratch each generation. The Wii stands as a prime example: Although it gradually built up an impressive selection of retro Virtual Console games over its lifetime, once the Wii U launched, Nintendo had to wipe the slate clean and release the games--at its typical glacial pace--all over again on the Wii U eShop.</p><p dir="ltr">That will not be the case moving forward thanks to Nintendo Switch Online, which Furukawa confirmed will also be available on Switch 2. Over the past seven years, the subscription service has amassed a vast collection of legacy games between its base and Expansion Pack tiers, so out of the gate Switch 2 users will have access to a wealth of classics--and a continued reason to subscribe to the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Time will tell how the Switch 2 will ultimately fare whenever it finally launches, but these are promising signs that Nintendo is taking the lessons of its past failures seriously and is doing its best to avoid repeating the mistakes that have hampered its previous consoles.</p>

                <p>Nearly nine years ago, the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-more-new-switch-games-confirmed-after-nintend/1100-6457551/" data-ref-id="1100-6457551">Crashlands</a> introduced players to an alien space trucker named Flux Dabes as she survived a crash landing on the planet Woanope and crafted her way out of that jam. Flux's history will repeat itself this spring when Crashlands 2 arrives. In the new trailer below, Flux is literally dropped on to Woanope again as she is forced to make a new life for herself until she can get off-world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7fzLf59vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ib7fzLf59vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, Flux has to start over from scratch. That means if she wants a home, she'll have to build one herself. As before, Flux can craft her own objects and buildings, and she can also create weapons, traps, and any kind of gadget she needs to survive on Woaope. But on this world, Flux isn't necessarily on top of the food chain, and the alien creatures often hunt each other.</p><p>The announcement for the game also hints that Flux will uncover multiple mysteries on Woanope, and she'll be making some new friends to help her solve them. An ancient warrior named Grandmammy is among her new allies, in addition to Kleewik, an inventor who can employ Flux as a lab technician. Beyond mere escape, Flux's goal is to unite the various factions of Woanope, and "restore balance to the planet."</p><p>"Since the moment we launched the original Crashlands, we've been wanting to come back for round 2," Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster said in a statement. "But we wanted it to be bigger and better in every way, and it's taken many years to be able to pull that off. We can't wait to see newcomers experience the world of Woanope for the first time, and for players of the original to reconnect with Flux. So many people have told us that the original Crashlands was an important part of their childhood, and now we get to bring them a Crashlands 2 that's grown up as much as they have!"</p><p>Crashlands 2 will launch on PC, iOS, and Android on April 10, and players will be able to use cross-platform saves. The game is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-purchase-hasnt-helped-xbox-game-pass-report-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t helped it grow Xbox Game Pass or the gaming business in general. According to a new report from The Information, the growth from the acquisition has yet to hit what Microsoft was hoping for when it made the $69 billion purchase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Information claims</a> that Microsoft was hoping that the purchase would help convince more players to sign up to the service as well as push more studios to releasing their games on the subscription-based platform. Instead, their sources say say that “several leading game studios have resisted Microsoft’s pitch that they should put their titles on Game Pass in exchange for fees that Microsoft offers to pay to the gaming studios.”</p>



<p>Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who oversees funds including a reported $800 million of Microsoft stock, told the outlet, “[Activision] has been disappointing.”</p>



<p>Microsoft had targeted reaching 100 million subscribers by 2030. As of February 2024, there were 34 million subscribers, including those who became subscribers after Microsoft converted Xbox Live to Xbox Game Pass Core. Microsoft has failed to hit Game Pass growth targets in each of the last two years. That led to Game Pass’s growth being dropped as a metric that determined CEO Satya Nadella’s pay at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its prices</a> while introducing a new tier—Game Pass Standard—that took away Day One releases from console subscribers unless they upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft expected more studios and publishers to rent Azure cloud servers for their games. It’s said that Activision is still using Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its server rentals along with “primarily relying on its own servers for development”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft regarding the report. Should a response of any kind be received, it will be added to this story. Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>

                <p>It's officially 115 Day for Zombies fans, with January 15 being the yearly celebration of Call of Duty's Zombies mode. For this year's festivities, Treyarch has revealed the details for the next Zombies map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>, and double XP is now live to celebrate 115 Day.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's new Zombies map is called The Tomb, which will launch with the start of Season 2 on January 28. This map's narrative follows the events of the Citadelle des Morts main quest, with the characters headed to an excavation site in search of the Sentinel Artifact. A first look at the map can be seen in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245" data-ratio="0.5375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245"></a><figcaption>The Tomb DLC map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says The Tomb was designed to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. The developer also teases one of the season's new weapons by saying, "What if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?" This could be hinting at the return of the MP-40 or PPSh-41 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate 115 Day, a quad feed of double XP is available in Black Ops 6 from now until January 21. This includes the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2X GobbleGum earn rate</li><li dir="ltr">2X Player XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Weapon XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Battle Pass XP</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch included a preview of the quality-of-life upgrades planned for the Season 2 update. This includes a challenge-tracking feature similar to the one available in Modern Warfare 3, letting players track up to 10 challenges for camos and calling cards.</p><p dir="ltr">A new co-op pause feature is being added with Season 2. Currently, the pause feature is only available in solo games, but the update will include the option to pause when playing with friends. This feature requires all players to be in the same party, and the party leader will have the ability to pause the match for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have the ability to choose a separate HUD preset for Zombies and multiplayer, so they no longer need to switch HUDs between modes.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on The Tomb will arrive closer to the season's launch, but here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything we know so far about Season 2</a>, including the much-anticipated updates for the Ricochet anti-cheat.</p>

            <p>
Stray Kite Studios, the indie developer co-founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> lead designer Paul Hellquist, has unveiled its first original title - fantasy themed real-time tactics roguelite Wartorn, which is coming to PC early access at some point this "spring".
</p>
<p>
Stray Kite - whose other co-founder is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/age-of-empires-online">Age of Empires Online</a> lead programmer Shovaen Patel - has previously collaborated on likes of Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, but Wartorn will be its first original release. It follows two elven sisters, Yara and Elani, as they journey across the war-ravaged Isles of Talaur - a fantasy realm "torn apart by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds" - in order to reach the safety of their ancestral home.
</p>
<p>
Wartorn is described as a "single-player, squad-based, roguelite campaign experience" that'll see players recruiting groups of strategically diverse fantasy creatures - including goblins, elves, demons, treefolk, and more - to their Caravan. Squads can be mixed and matched before skirmishes, with battlefield positioning, squad combos, and careful deployment of abilities all said to be key. Losses, however, will reduce morale, and it's Game Over if all hope is lost.

<p>
Additionally, there's talk of emergent, elemental-themed combat, enabling players to harness the likes of fire, water, lightning, tar, and planta to create unique tactical opportunities - with tar amplifying fire, lightning surging through water, and so on. That's on top of a physics-based environmental destruction system, intended to add "depth and unpredictability" to battles - and there's also a slow-down-time feature, giving players pause to issue precise commands in order to make "even the most complex scenarios... accessible".
</p><p>
Stray Kite is also touting a heavy focus on narrative, with players facing "unpredictable" events with each new attempt to get home. These are said to involve tough, impactful decisions - from who gets fed to which lives can be saved - plus "moral quandaries of violence and sacrifice".
</p>
<p>
"Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness," Hellquist (who also served as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> creative director) explains in today's announcement. "We've poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us."
</p>
<p>
Wartorn is currently scheduled to enter early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store sometime this "spring". Stray Kite is promising a "polished experience and a wide range of units, squad upgrades, hero upgrades, family members, biomes, maps, events, and quests" at launch, with more coming as development progresses toward Wartorn's 1.0 release.

<p>According to the studio, Arkheron will feature familiar “ideas and concepts”, but the game is “about creating something entirely new”. That being a dynamic, fast-paced PvP gameplay experience.</p>



<p>“There’s a simple truth at the heart of our development philosophy,” Pardo said via release. “If we don’t love our game, our players won’t either. We believe the best games are born from a genuine love of playing them, which is why we’ve poured years of passion into developing&nbsp;Arkheron, constantly iterating and refining it to deliver something truly unique and exciting. </p>



<p>“We’ve played the game daily as a team for years, and while we haven’t figured out yet exactly how to describe it, we often say ‘you have to play it to get it’. We’re eager to start sharing the fun we’ve found in&nbsp;Arkheron&nbsp;with a wider community soon, and we hope players will love it as much as we do.”</p>



<p>The game has been holding private playtests and will be opening it up to more players in the coming months. Signups <a href="https://bonfirestudios.com/playtest/index.html?rafid=FYK-22192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are currently open</a> for those in North America with more regions opening later this year.</p>



<p>What are you hoping Bonfire Studios’ Arkheron entails, and are you going to sign up for the playtest? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/15/xbox-repair-reduce-waste-energy-saving/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> new options for support to repair your Xbox console. The first, for in-person repairs, will begin on January 20 with uBreakiFix by Asurion becoming an Xbox Authorized Service Provider at nearly 700 store locations across the US The second involves the Microsoft Store, with replacement components becoming available to purchase online as of today.</p><p>According to the blog post, these options include the Xbox Series S - 1TB in Robot White, Xbox Series X - 1TB Digital Edition in Robot White, and Xbox Series X - 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition. Microsoft advises reaching out to your nearest <a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uBreakiFix</a> by Asurion location and confirming participation in the program.</p><p>If you prefer to order parts online, the components are available via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's online store</a>, as well as the Microsoft Repair Hub on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iFixit</a>. Previously, the replacement components available for purchase were limited to controller parts.</p><p>In the blog post, Microsoft also details a correlation between these new repair options and the company's goal to become a "zero waste, carbon-negative, and water-positive company by 2030." In the meantime, it's aiming to eliminate single-use plastics from its packaging by 2025--hence why the Xbox Series X|S packaging is paper- and fiber-based.</p><p>Said goal has also had a smaller impact on the consoles themselves. According to Microsoft, it has improved how the Xbox Series S handles video, with average reduction approaching 10% in power consumption. The company also recommends using the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which can be found via Settings, General, and Power Options on your console.</p><p>The shutdown option has been available since September of last year, its addition paired alongside the announcement that the company's green initiatives have saved over 3 billion car miles of CO2 emissions. Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-green-initiatives-for-xbox-have-saved-over-3bn-car-miles-of-co2-emissions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">push for AI technology</a>, however, is undermining said efforts. "We fundamentally believe that the answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly," Microsoft president Brad Smith told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-15/microsoft-s-ai-investment-imperils-climate-goal-as-emissions-jump-30?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "I guarantee there's one way to fail: It's to give up."</p>
