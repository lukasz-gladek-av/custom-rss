<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is getting a big new Worlds update which treats the space sim's gazillions of planets to a sumptuous overhaul, using technology devised for stablemate fantasy sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, which only has one planet, albeit a literally Earth-sized one with dragons. Catch a deep dive trailer for the Worlds update below.
</p>

<p>
The Worlds update introduces water features that boast ripples, foam and reflections, clouds that form and disintegrate in real-time, and weather effects such as rolling fog, rain and blizzards - all of them sculpted by a revised wind system. Skies have more colours, iceworlds boast shinier glaciers, and deserts have more diverse vegetation. They've also gussied up the lighting so that objects, from trees to clouds, cast shadows in relation to the sun's position.

<p>
Sparkling ambient flourishes aside, the update brings new solar ships, aka space sailboats, the possibility of sentient walking houses on weirder planets, and a host of new creatures for the menagerie. "We want to do things that people haven't seen before," explains studio boss Sean Murray in a release, bathetically adding "and of course, these new creatures can all be pets and mounts". The Worlds update also introduces a new Expedition, which features a flamethrower-wielding mech, and is "Starship Troopers inspired" - I suspect it also owes something to the recent popularity of a certain squad-based democracy management game. 
</p>
<p>Mindful that the swisher the scenery, the greater the toll on your poor old GPU,the patch also makes a few technical revisions with performance in mind. "Rendering of environmental objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been moved to a GPU-based system, allowing for denser worlds with increased performance," read <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/">the full patch notes</a>. "Planetary flora, minerals and curiosities have improved levels of detail from further distances and a broader range of angles. Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, increasing loading speed, improving framerate and saving memory." There’s a lot more through the jump, including details of new cosmetics and underwater base fixtures, though beware that it’s an absolute landslide of autoplaying videos.</p>
<p>
"Six months ago we announced Light No Fire," Murray comments in the press release. "It's this insanely ambitious game. Over the last five years making game, we've learnt new things, and we're feeding that back into No Man's Sky. It feels like we're bringing technology back from the future!" If you'd like to know more about Light No Fire, Hello <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-studio-hello-games-unveil-light-no-fire-a-fantasy-survival-game-set-on-a-single-huge-planet">invited me down to see it a few months back</a>. I personally am a huge fan of the kingfishers.

Lightning Emission works as Bunny moves swiftly through an area, dealing electric damage to enemies and inflicting Electrocute. To a low-level mob, it’s typically enough to one-shot everyone. If you move quickly enough, those Kuiper Shards add up.

<p>EA Sports has released its first trailer along with the reveal of the features coming to EA Sports FC 25 this year.</p>



<p>Returning to the game this year are Manager and Player Career Modes as well as Clubs. New for this year is the long-rumored, now confirmed 5v5 Rush mode. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/features/rush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mode is available</a> within Football Ultimate Team (FUT), Clubs, Kick-Off, and Manager Career.</p>



<p>Also new in EA FC 25 is FC IQ, which EA Sports calls an “overhaul of tactical foundations”.</p>



<p>“An overhaul of tactical foundations across the game delivers greater strategic control and more realistic collective movement at the team level, while a new AI model, powered by real-world data, influences player tactics through all-new Player Roles,” EA Sports says.</p>



<p>Within Career mode, there will be a post-launch update that introduces Live Start Points that allows you to “live out the biggest storylines from the real world”. More details on that will come at a later date.</p>



<p>EA Sports FC 25 releases for everyone on September 27 for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Those who buy the Ultimate Edition of the game will get access starting September 20.</p>



<p>For those wondering, the HyperMotionV technology within EA Sports FC 25 is only available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Those on last-gen consoles and the Nintendo Switch will continue to get the last-gen version of the game.</p>

But it has been heavily criticized for its ultra aggressive monetization, which includes the cost of Ultimate versions of its playable characters, called Descendants.</p><p>The grind associated with unlocking Ultimate Descendants without paying money is immense, as players face some extreme drop rates for essential items, but that hasn’t stopped players from giving it a good go. One player, however, has taken the grind to extreme levels, putting in 200 hours over the course of just a few weeks to unlock all the Ultimate Descendants. That is, on average, 14 hours of playtime a day.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1e4r116/every_ultimate_descendant_unlocked_without/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor chicha112</a> showcased their eye-opening achievement with a number of screenshots and an impromptu ‘ask me anything’ of sorts as The First Descendant players reacted in disbelief.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/17/tfd-1721230903759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Chicha112 / reddit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Chicha112, who plays on PC, explained that they are a veteran of Warframe, a looter shooter from which The First Descendant takes inspiration, as well as Korean MMOs in general (Nexon is a Korean developer). Then it was just a matter of “raw grinding.”</p><p>“There's a lot of questions in the whole thread that I have tried to answer, but honestly when it comes to tips, it just comes down to making sure you're strong enough to tackle the content efficiently and then grinding it out,” Chicha112 said. “No special tricks or super tips to get ahead as far as I know.”</p><p>“A lot of these systems aren't surprising and I like to do things efficiently,” Chicha112 explained. “I also do just have a lot of free time ATM so I am lucky to be able to grind so much.”</p><p>“My playtime is 200 hours, I'm pretty sure I have some AFK time because of the maintenance day two and leaving the game on. I'm sure it’s a bit late for others, but a good tip to keep in mind is having a good foundation to grind these characters is very important. Having a strong weapon and a decently built character lowers the farming time by a lot! For example, I used my first energy capacitor and a couple crystallization catalysts on my base non-Ultimate Bunny while I was going through the game very early on to minimize my time spent.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of these systems aren't surprising and I like to do things efficiently. I also do just have a lot of free time ATM so I am lucky to be able to grind so much.</p></div><p>Chicha112 did admit they had to buy character slots (yet another part of The First Descendant that is sold for real-world money) to house the Ultimate Descendants they’d unlocked. “Hoping they add a way to obtain them for free,” they added.</p><p>Some players have recommended Chicha112 now take a break from the game, which it sounds like they intend to do. “I’m all tapped out of sanity,” they said. "Yes it's time to touch some grass."</p><p>What does this tell us about The First Descendant and its grind? Nothing we didn't already know. This is a free-to-play game from Nexon, and so the grind to unlock coveted virtual items for the game's characters was always going to be punishing. But at least now the community knows the true time value of the money they're spending, should they choose to splash out on all the Ultimate Descendants in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Somewhat related, this week <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-asks-players-to-stop-afk-farming-please">Nexon asked The First Descendant community to stop AFK farming</a>, or going AFK during co-op missions, after it became a big problem soon after launch. Nexon was also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>accused of copying Destiny 2 icons</u></a> for the icons used in The First Descendant, something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations"><u>the company has now said it will address in-game</u></a>.</p><p>Last week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does"><u>a significant update for The First Descendant</u></a> that makes some big changes to the game, but leaves some aspects that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review"><u>The First Descendant review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Series director Masayoshi Yokoyama said he'll make that game one day, but it won't be the next title.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>While RGG also develops <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-review">the Super Monkey Ball series</a> alongside a handful of other more random games, it's inarguably most known for the Like a Dragon series (as Ryu Ga Gotoku literally means Like a Dragon) so the studio drumming up interest already likely points to a more mainline reveal.</p><p>That being said, it has suggested fans will be "surprised" by its next game, essentially meaning anything is possible. Like a Dragon has many offshoots itself, so a ninth (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">technically 10th thanks to prequel Yakuza 0</a>) mainline game isn't the only option.</p><p>RGG has previously referred to spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a> as the "first" Gaiden game, for example, and it could even remake PlayStation Portable and Japanese-only games Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō for modern platforms like it did with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-ishin-review">Like a Dragon: Ishin</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It has full spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgement</a> waiting in the wings too, its still action heavy but more murder mystery, detective focused series which hasn't seen a new release since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lost-judgment-review">Lost Judgement</a> arrived in 2021.</p><p>It could also be something completely new altogether, though even this would seemingly follow a similar template or at least be set in Japan. As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-casting-audition-finalists-for-new-title-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, a public casting competition for RGG's next game is seeking a "Minato-style girl." Minato is an area of Tokyo but "Minato girl" specifically is slang used to describe a well off young woman.</p><p>Fans will just have to wait and see what the next RGG game is, but thankfully the reveal isn't too far away. The franchise's 20th anniversary takes place in 2025, and as RGG released the beloved Yakuza 0 as a special 10th anniversary project, it may be looking to do something just as grandiose next year.</p><p>Though this seems a particularly quick turnaround for a studio that just released its last mainline (and massive) game earlier in 2024, RGG is known for launching myriad games in a short period of time.</p><p>In the last five years, for example, it's released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgement Remastered, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: 12 games in total.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the latest</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Amazon Games is bringing free-to-play Korean MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a> to the West in September, and we now know all the ways the publisher is changing the game's business model to better fit the expectations of western players.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/tl-business-model" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Throne and Liberty website, Amazon and developer NCSOFT outlined how the game's monetization will differ from the Korean version, explaining its goals, the main currencies players will be interacting with, and detailing how its five-day paid early access period will work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTA16Vhgzss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HTA16Vhgzss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For starters, one of Amazon's stated goals is to make combat and power upgrades accessible to all players, not just ones who pay real money to get ahead. To further that mission statement, its in-game store won't sell one of the game's core currencies used to craft and upgrade gear, nor will it sell potions or food that may give players who have them an advantage. Quests and rewards exclusive to the paid battle pass will be removed. An optional subscription seen in the Korean version of the MMO that grants players various benefits, the Blessing of Solisium, won't be available (at least at launch), as Amazon is continuing to "evaluate how this offering needs to change to serve the needs of our players."</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes coming with the western release of Throne and Liberty include a reduction in price for both its premium battle pass and leveling pass. Both will be purchasable with a currency earnable from in-game activities or selling items on the auction house called Lucent, instead of real-world money. The battle pass has been upgraded too, with additional cosmetics and an improved final reward for those who do decide to purchase the premium version. That aligns with one of Amazon's other stated goals for the game's monetization model: The idea that purchasing items from the shop should feel rewarding but not necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty will offer a Early Access Pack prior to the game's launch that will let owners begin playing five days early, causing concern among some players that those who spend money will gain a noticeable headstart and advantage in Throne and Liberty's PvP-heavy endgame over those who opt to wait. To address those concerns, Amazon announced Throne and Liberty will launch with early access servers. All players who purchase early access will start on those servers, and players who join on the free-to-play launch date will have the option of picking new launch servers or joining an existing early access server should they so choose. Those who purchase early access will not be able to transfer a character from an early access server to a launch server for a period of time to ensure fairness, and the auction houses for early access servers and launch servers will not be connected.</p><p dir="ltr">More details about Throne and Liberty's early access offering will come alongside the game's open beta, which will run from July 18-23. Throne and Liberty is set to release on PC and current generation consoles on September 17 or September 12 for those who purchase early access.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty won't be Amazon's only MMO releasing this year. It's in-house developed New World, originally released in 2021, is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-revamps-the-mmo-for-consoles-with-solo-play-and-more-changes/1100-6524219/" data-ref-id="1100-6524219">rebooted for consoles and PC in the form of New World: Aeternum Edition</a>.</p>

                <p>Just over a year after the Barbie film hit theaters, the pink girlie girl is getting a brand-new video game on consoles and PC. In Barbie Project Friendship, you play as both Barbie "Malibu" Roberts and Barbie "Brooklyn" Roberts as they try to save the run-down Malibu Waves Community Center. You can play the entire game solo or with a friend in local co-op.</p><p>In Project Friendship, you'll remodel and explore the community center: cleaning out storage, fixing lights, decorating the space, and more. As you play, you'll unlock outfits and furniture to customize your look. There are also a variety of minigames, including an Overcooked-inspired restaurant rush, bike and scooter repair, tennis, skateboarding, playing guitar, and making ice cream with Ken.</p>

            <p>
Sega has revealed it's taken legal action against a social media user for harassing one of its employees, warning that it will continue to pursue legal remedies or criminal proceedings should similar occurrences happen in the future.
</p>
<p>
The company - which published a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/customer_harassment_policy/">Consumer Harassment Policy</a> last year - reiterated its stance on social media harassment in a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/240717_1.html">post on its Japanese website</a>. Providing context, it explained it has been dealing with an individual who has made "excessive slanderous and insulting comments on social media against one of our employees" for a "long time".
</p>
<p>
After the individual failed to improve their behaviour, Sega continued, the company was granted access to the person's information through the court. Since then, it's reached a settlement, with the individual agreeing to "pay damages to our employee, delete the slanderous and insulting comments, and refrain from such actions in the future."

<p>
Sega adds it will take similar measures against anyone that breaks its Customer Harassment Policy in the future. "We consider slanderous acts against employees, such as announcements of violent acts, threats, and intimidation, to be serious human rights issues that damage the dignity of employees and lead to a deterioration of the work environment", it writes.
</p>
<p>
"We do not tolerate any harassing behaviour," it cotinues, "and in order to respect all employees and protect their human rights, we will continue to take appropriate action based on our Customer Harassment Policy when we judge any behaviour to be malicious." It then suggests customers familiarise themselves with its harassment policy and "refrain from any behaviour that damages the dignity of employees."
</p>
<p>
Sega's announcement comes as the harassment of games industry employees by players continues to be a concern. A survey of 2,300 attendees at last year's Game Developer Conference <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/majority-of-game-devs-see-harassment-from-players-as-major-problem-survey-claims">revealed</a> 91 percent of respondents believed player harassment and toxicity towards developers was an issue, while 42 percent felt it was a "very serious" issue. 40 percent of developers surveyed had experienced harassment themselves, with women, non-binary people, and members of the LGBT+ community most likely to be targets.

The new shepherding/creature collecting game from developer Hollow Ponds is full of color and life, inviting you to explore its vibrant world and sate your curiosity about the flora and fauna that abound. The word “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535">cozy</a></span>” gets thrown around a lot in games today, but <em>Flock</em> fits the bill thanks to simple mechanics that ease you into a meditative calm. <em>Flock</em> is about just vibing out, and sometimes that’s exactly what you need.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196918,196307" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Flock</em> is a picturesque pastoral adventure in which you roam around various biomes astride a big bird. Your mission, though it’s a very laid back affair, is to document and categorize all the various flying species in the game for your Aunt Jane, a professor of zoology. A short tutorial runs you through the game’s sparse mechanics. You fly by directing your bird with the left stick and dashing with the right trigger, that’s it. When you find a new species, you go into an observation stage to pick out all of its unique aspects, after which you will have to match it to its descriptor and name in your trusty notebook. </p><p>Once the tutorial is finished, large swathes of the map open up. The overarching goal is to catalog every creature and track down your aunt’s lost whistles. Each whistle is associated with a specific family of animals and lets you charm them. Once charmed, they become part of your flock, meaning they will follow you around wherever you fly, so you gradually accumulate a personal menagerie full of dazzling colors.</p><figure id="" data-id="f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-recommend-id="image://f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures on birds soar through a colorful landscape with creatures following behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two figures on birds soar through a colorful landscape with creatures following behind" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-recommend-id="image://f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures on birds soar through a colorful landscape with creatures following behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s talk about that menagerie, as the creatures are the main event of <em>Flock</em>. The game’s color palette, apparent in the landscapes but most evident in the creature design, is incredibly bright and varied. Each species is something between a fish and a bird. Some creatures have clear and direct real-world inspirations, such as the eel-like Piper family, but others are more varied and fantastical. Even when creatures are part of the same family, however, they have their own colors and small embellishments. To stick with the Pipers, one is a simple purple while another looks like a rainbow snake toy you might use to entertain a cat. Cataloging the game’s species simply requires you to observe, and that instruction might be the most important part of <em>Flock</em>. It’s all about observing the beauty on display. You can also play the game with friends in co-op, though I’ve only explored solo so far.<br></p><p>The fluid flying creates a flow-state-like experience. Without the need to control the altitude at which you fly, moving around becomes an intuitive push forward into new areas, each with their own gorgeous landscapes and species to discover. By the time you’re flying around with a posse of creatures behind you, it might become clear that this game is a spiritual successor to 2014’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hohokum-the-kotaku-review-1619997976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hohokum-the-kotaku-review-1619997976"><em>Hohokum</em></a></span>. That’s intentional, as both games are from the minds of Ricky Hagget and Richard Hogg. While the cataloging and whistle collecting of <em>Flock</em> is far more structured than the <em>Hohokum</em>, both instill the same sense of calm. </p><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421108/hohokum-is-a-whimsical-and-soothing-game-about-exploration-and&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421108/hohokum-is-a-whimsical-and-soothing-game-about-exploration-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em></a></span> preview for <em>Hohokum</em>, Hogg said that the game was “about relaxing in a space and just enjoying the experience and the music.” That is the same ethos behind <em>Flock</em>. It’s all about going where your curiosity takes you and enjoying whatever you discover on that journey. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/ea-sports-fc-25-preview-what-a-rush/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Football fever has been at its peak this summer, as the entertaining league seasons fed into the not quite as exciting Euros and Copa America. As is always the case with an international-filled summer, we’ve only got a short break before the 2024/25 season kicks off, and that means a new EA Sports FC game nears release as well. I had the chance to play some of EA Sports FC 25, which featured the UEFA Champions League Kick Off mode, and the new Rush mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBM2xyco_Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The EA FC 25 closed beta had seven teams to choose from men’s and women’s football across both modes. Those were both the men’s and women’s Real Madrid and Chelsea teams, Manchester City men’s team, Liverpool men’s team, Athletico Madrid men’s team, Liverpool men’s team, and the women’s Olympique Lyonnais team. As you would expect, each has their strengths with Real Madrid and Manchester City having the best stats, though every team has its key players.</p>


<p>To make those players stand out, FC 25 sees the return of playstyles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a>. These are attributes that enhance specific elements of a player’s skillset, with key players having elite playstyles. For example, Valverde has Rapid+ which gives him a higher sprint speed when dribbling, and reduces the chances of making mistakes when sprinting or performing knock ons. Another player with an elite playstyle is De Bruyne, with his Incisive Pass+, which makes through passes more accurate, gives his swerve passes maximum curve, and precision passes that travel at top speed towards their target.</p>


<p>While the game has been enhanced with a new FC IQ to manage player tactics,&nbsp;EA FC 25’s main on the pitch action feels very similar to its predecessor. Much of the matches condense around the midfield with occasional bursts through the centre and the wings to either get a shot on goal, or fire a cross in. Goals do feel easy to score, with none of my matches played being a 0-0 draw. This was playing the game on Professional difficulty. Getting the ball into the box for and cutting back a pass to another player almost always guarantees a goal. Worldies are harder to pull off, but in one match I managed to replicate Bellingham’s overhead kick that he scored against Slovakia.</p>
<p>For the full game, there’s a few marquee changes built around the core on pitch action. The career mode will let you dive into women’s football for the first time, giving parity to the men’s game across all modes, and there’s also a new Live Start Points feature that will take real world scenarios and put you in control after the mid-season transfer window or managerial changes, for example. Reckon you can survive the fight at the bottom of a league?</p>

<p>The mode that could really ignite the excitement for EA FC 25 is Rush mode, in what is a fresh take on five-a-side football and the Volta mode of recent years, with two teams of five players playing. This can be single player with AI teammates, or with four other players with an AI goalie. Where a proper match can at times feel slow, Rush mode is fast paced and end-to-end, feeling more like a basketball game as teams rapidly go back and forth trying to score.</p>
<p>Now, some of you may remember the blue card controversy from earlier this year. FIFA proposed introducing a blue card that would send players to a sin bin temporarily for certain infractions for a limited time, before being allowed back on the pitch. While that idea was dropped in reality, the blue card is present in Rush mode. If a player gets blue carded, they are sent off leaving their team at a disadvantage, but only for a period of time. There is no way around it, as Rush mode does not have substitutes either.</p>

<p>Rush mode will not just be a standalone playable mode either, with it being confirmed that it will be part of Ultimate Team. Just like standard Ultimate Team, players will be able to build a five player team to compete in FUT Rush. It’s also integrated into Manager Career, giving you control over a team’s Youth Academy development with 5v5 tournaments to take part in.</p>
<p>While the closed beta only gave a small look at what to expect with FC 25, the general impression is a little mixed. The main game feels more of the same from FC 24, with the on the pitch action not being too different. It is Rush mode that really gives some fresh breath of life (more so than the name change) to the series, and I think it will be incredibly popular for all players due to how entertaining and quick it is.</p>

            <p>If DICE's Battlefield series lacks for one feature, it's surely the option to dig trenches. Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a>. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.</p>
<p>Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/over-the-top-ww1">Over The Top WW1</a> instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.</p>

<p>Over The Top WW1 is a historical multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> from the peeps behind the fairly well-received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358710/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom/">Battle Cry Of Freedom</a>. It pits up to 200 people or bots against each other in either prefabricated or customisable combat scenarios, on either "hand-crafted" maps (there are "over 12") or randomly generated terrain. You can also make your own maps in the editor, which seems pretty full-featured, and thrills with the prospect of custom map files a "few megabytes" in size. If I can fit those map files on a floppy disc, this is an automatic Bestest Best.</p>
<p>Also promising: the directional melee combat, which takes inspiration from Mount &amp; Blade, and the dynamic weather effects, which include visibility-lowering fog, ballistics-altering wind, and lightning storms that can bring down trees.</p>
<p>You may enlist as one of four classes: Infantry, who get flamethrowers, light machineguns and bolt-action rifles; Artillery, who lurk in the backrow dealing death by cowardly indirect means; Specialists, aka, engineers, who get to dig trenches and erect defences such as bunkers; and Tankers, who get to drive such mighty primordial vehicles as the British Mark IV or the "agile yet potent" Renault FT-17.</p>
<p>Convinced? You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778610/Over_The_Top_WWI/">read more on Steam</a>. Unconvinced? I'll fetch my shovel.</p>

Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ">this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week</a>. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.</p>

<p>Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHBtMQaj7w0">a video featuring series producer&nbsp;Yoshio Sakamoto</a>, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.</p>

<p>"In&nbsp;Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.</p>

<p>Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.</p>

            <p>
The development team behind EA Sports FC 25 - which launches this year on 27th September and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/england-talisman-jude-bellingham-is-ea-sports-fc-25-cover-star">hosts England star Jude Bellingham on its cover</a> - isn't worried about a potential revival of the FIFA brand at another developer. 
</p>
<p>
FIFA itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-insists-the-only-authentic-real-game-that-has-the-fifa-name-will-be-the-best-one-available">has not been shy about wanting to rope in a new company</a> to make a fresh football game with its branding, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-unveils-post-fifa-rebranding">the collapse of its long-running partnership with EA Sports back in 2022</a>.
</p>

Rumours have persisted that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-will-develop-the-next-fifa-game-leaker-claims">FIFA licence has now been picked up by another developer</a> with plans to launch a fresh FIFA product in time for the next World Cup. Who could it be? Well, 2K, publisher of the NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K and WWE 2K sports series, has reportedly been in the frame. 
</p>
<p>
So, are EA's FC team worried about a new rival? In short, no, not at all.

"We welcome competition," EA Sports FC associate producer Sam Rivera told Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell at preview event for FC 25 last week. "We welcome competition and I think that's good. It's good for everyone. We want to see what other what other football games can do. 
</p>
<p>
"But what I can tell you is [that to] create a fun, deep football game takes many years. For us, like literally every year, just on community feedback, we take in thousands of changes, little things here and there. We try so many different things and then we're finally in a position where we know how we can fix these. 
</p>
<p>
"If you compare [EA Sports FC] 24 and [FIFA] 14 - 10 years difference - there's a lot of improvements, a lot of things that you can right away see. The amount of bugs, amount of problems [it had], the game [now] is just a lot more polished. And that takes 10 years to get there. So basically it takes time, iteration, knowing what the community wants. Those things don't happen just by themselves. You need to hear from them. They don't get built by themselves. It's an interesting process we go through every year."
</p>
<p>
Ultimate Team line producer Karthik Venkateshan also discussed the likely impending arrival of a new footballing game rival.
</p>
<p>
"I guess from a dev perspective, we're excited - we're football fans ourselves," Venkateshan said. "We're excited when something pops up, we're always playing other games, seeing different takes. I'm like, 'Oh, they approached it that way'. Like, what do we think about it? 
</p>
<p>
"And it's also - I don't know, healthy? The little bit of American in me thinks its healthy when there's competition? [I'm] energised, more so than like... 'am I worried?' No, not really."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25%E2%80%99s-exciting-new-5v5-experience.929820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following community feedback, the newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-25-officially-announced-full-reveal-on-july-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a> is ditching the arcade-like Volta mode in favor of Rush. This brand new mode pits two teams of five players each against one another in an appropriately sized pitch of 63.7x46.7 meters (down from the standard 105x68 meters). The size went through various iterations to get it right.</p>
<p>The main difference with Volta is that Rush fully retains the gameplay mechanics of the regular 11v11 mode when it comes to depth and balance of defending, attacking, dribbling, shooting, et cetera. Rush is obviously meant to be a social, accessible mode, with four humans (and the AI-controlled goalkeeper) controlling one player on each team. This allows them to have far more time with the ball, and every action on the field matters more due to the reduced team size. Positioning is also completely dynamic, just like in five-a-side football.</p>
<p>While Rush's core mechanics are identical to regular matches, the developers still chose to introduce a few key changes to spice up the experience. For example, the kick-off sees players rushing to the ball, Rocket-League style; this does not apply to resuming the game after the other team has scored, which happens exactly like in real football. The offside line starts on the attacking third rather than the attacking half of a team to accommodate the different pitch and team sizes.</p>
<p>Perhaps more intriguing is the addition of blue cards. This has been discussed quite a while in the real sports, although FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed earlier this year the idea was ultimately scrapped. The concept is essentially borrowed from other sports: instead of a final red card that sends a player off the pitch for good, the blue card is a limited-time ban, as you would see in hockey or water polo. Currently, it lasts for one minute (a standard Rush match lasts eight minutes).</p>
<p>This creates an interesting dynamic where players need to be really careful with the fouls, else they might be crippling their team for a fairly sizable amount of time. With one less player on the pitch, everything is that much more challenging. On the flip side, just like in hockey or water polo, it creates a feeling where the team really needs to focus on holding off their rivals' attempts to score for a set amount of time, and if they do, all will be well. Lastly, the penalty is also changed into a 1v1 battle reminiscent of old US-style shootouts, where the captain of the defending team briefly controls the goalkeeper.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_UT-POS_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Rush is definitely a different 'mode' of playing EA Sports FC 25, it is perhaps not quite accurate to mention it as a separate mode. That's because it's actually integrated into every other mode available in the game: Kick Off, Clubs, Ultimate Team, and Manager Career (in the latter mode, you take control of your Youth Academy development throughout the season with new playable 5v5 tournaments). EA Sports wanted to take advantage of the shared progression system so that players would always feel like they were earning rewards regardless of what they were playing.</p>
<p>Thanks to EA, I was able to access a preview build of EA Sports FC 25 for a few hours to play Rush, and I have to say it was really fun, providing a faster, more accessible experience that, however, retains the core of what players love about the game. I played it as a single player, though, which inevitably felt more limited: the true potential of Rush will be unlocked online, with three friends with which you'll coordinate on who is in charge of taking care of that side of the pitch, for example.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBM2xyco_Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is particularly relevant because the tactical options are limited: you can choose players before the match, but there are no substitutions, and you cannot assign AI-powered players to handle a specific Player Role. Rush will inevitably be tweaked a lot ahead of launch and even more so afterward, being a brand new experience, but I believe it has the potential to be a hit.</p>

Although a few can be encountered throughout other areas of the world map or only in certain situations, nearly all of them have a home on Sakurajima itself. Exploring the island is a great way to fill out your Paldex and discover some new unpaid workers—err, I mean <em>friends</em>.</p><h2 id="h26442"><a id="alpha"></a>Challenge the new Alpha Pals</h2><p>In that same vein, I recommend taking on the new Alpha Pals introduced. Outside of the dungeons, you have your choice between a level 54 Menasting Terra and a level 55 Knocklem. Aside from being a fun challenge and a great way to farm some rewards, each will be a welcome asset to your max-leveled teams. They’re both powerful Ground-type Pals that can help against Electric-types.</p><h2 id="h26443"><a id="saya"></a>Take on Saya, the latest Faction Leader</h2><p>Another challenging reminder of the increased level cap is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-sakurajima-saya-selyne-faction-boss-1851587019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-sakurajima-saya-selyne-faction-boss-1851587019">new tower boss</a></span>.

Finding one is unfortunately a task on its own because it requires a pretty specific situation. Here are the important factors you need to know:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Selyne will only spawn during the newly added Meteorite Events. <strong> You can only catch them during a Meteorite Event <em>specifically</em>, not the Supply Drop event which is lumped under the same category.</strong> It’s entirely up to chance which event the game decides to give you.</li><li>The event needs to trigger for you in the Sakurajima region. At any other location, you’ll find some Xenovaders or perhaps a Xenogard if you’re lucky. Selyne will only spawn for you if the event occurs on the new island.</li><li>These events run on a timer. <strong>The community estimates that they usually occur once every three hours of playtime.</strong> It’s not dependent on an in-game day’s length, but should trigger around every three real-time hours.</li></ul><p>All of this means you need to be at the right place and time and hope the odds are in your favor. Set a timer once a Meteorite/Supply Drop Event occurs or mentally take note of the time. Once you’re nearing three hours, head to Sakurajima and pray you get a Meteorite. Once the stars align and you do see one, make sure you take care of any Syndicate members or nearby hostile pals. You don’t want to lose your chance to have a Selyne because of some angry NPCs.</p><h2 id="h26445"><a id="scrap"></a>Farm high-valued Scrap Piles</h2><p>Scrap Piles, added with the Sakurajima update, are a great source of loot.

Accommodating these are two more enhancement opportunities to raise your capture rate at Statues of Power. Considering how difficult it can be to capture Pals close to the new level cap, finding these will be a big help. All of the added <strong>Lifmunk Effigies can be found in sneaky places throughout the Sakurajima island, so I suggest being extra thorough and checking every giant mushroom and cliffside</strong>.</p><h2 id="h26447"><a id="dungeon"></a>Run through Cherry Blossom Cave dungeons</h2><figure id="" data-id="68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-recommend-id="image://68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character stands before a large staircase heading into a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character stands before a large staircase heading into a dungeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-recommend-id="image://68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character stands before a large staircase heading into a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every primary biome in <em>Palworld</em> has themed dungeons to go along with it.

<p>In an industry filled with bad news regularly, there’s some good news to report. A new game studio called Blue Scarab has been founded by former Helldivers 2, World of Warcraft, and Battlefield developers in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>



<p>“With the backing of NetEase Games we’re empowered to bring our vision to life. We’re grateful for their commitment to creative freedom, supporting expertise, and resources as we set off on this adventure,” Colin Cragg, CEO at Blue Scarab Entertainment, said via media release.</p>



<p>In addition to Cragg as CEO, former Blizzard principal designer Craig Morrison will serve as Studio Director. Lastly, Guillaume Lhoyer and Ashley Nicollete, both formerly of Helldivers 2, join Blue Scarab as Principal Game Designer and Marketing Director, respectively.</p>



<p>As far as their plans, Blue Scarab is developing a story-driven MMORPG in Unreal Engine 5. The game will feature “a unique blend of cozy escapism, true-crime, and horseback riding. that mixes exploration with true-crime.</p>



<p>“Innovation through iteration can be very powerful,” Morrison said. “Our goal is to bring all the expertise that our team has accumulated to forge new experiences for a wider audience than ever before. We want to try to defy genre expectations, while still leveraging all the skills and experience of the team we have assembled.”</p>



<p>Regarding any timeline on Blue Scarab’s in-development game, that wasn’t provided with the studio announcement.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1813589662654476714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, the Dying Light 2 team announced it will extend the Tower Raid Open Beta until August 1, 2024.</p>



<p>The Tower’s beta began on June 27, with plans to run until July 18, 2024. Today, the devs explained they want to “ensure everyone can load up on unique rewards.” They also invited even more feedback from the community to continue improving the raid.</p>



<p>In the Tower Raid Open Beta, players must climb several floors to reach the rooftop, surviving hordes of infected. Then, fans can earn rewards, and new items added to Jai’s inventory will continue to be available after the beta.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good news! 🎉  We're extending the Tower Raid Open Beta until August 1 to ensure everyone can load up on unique rewards.  So storm the Tower with your friends while you can and let us know what you think. Your feedback will help us improve Tower Raid. 🥰 <a href="https://t.co/toPCe4hrdA">pic.twitter.com/toPCe4hrdA</a></p>— Dying Light (@DyingLightGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DyingLightGame/status/1813589662654476714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Some fans are concerned that this lengthy extension implies the development on DLC 2 is troubled. However, the devs may simply need more time to implement fan feedback into the Tower Raid, a mode the Dying Light 2 community requested. </p>



<p>The beta is available on all platforms, and players can try the Tower Raid with solo or co-op gameplay. Fans can access the raid by completing the Lost Armory side quest and using Jai’s Board.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-onlin3-vintage-cube-tournament-black-lotus-prize-pool<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Magic: The Gathering is about to get one of its most surprising high-stakes tournaments yet, with $65k worth of the most prized and powerful cards up for grabs. Later this year, <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Magic: The Gathering Online</u></a> developer <a href="https://www.daybreakgames.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Daybreak</u></a> will partner with TCG accessory maker <a href="https://ultimateguard.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ultimate Guard</u></a> to host a competition centered around the iconic Vintage Cube format, culminating in a live “for keeps” draft with booster packs full of exceptionally rare cards, including an actual <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million"><u>Black Lotus</u></a>.</p><p>Called “Magic Online Vintage Cube LIVE: Powered by Ultimate Guard,” the online qualifiers for this tournament will start later this week and run through the lead up to <a href="https://mcvegas.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MagicCon: Las Vegas</u></a> in October, where the top eight competitors will do one final Vintage Cube draft in-person and keep all the cards they pick. MTGO Creative Director <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanspain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ryan Spain</u></a> explains to me that the concept was to make this “dream come true” Cube draft a reality, while Ultimate Guard’s <a href="https://x.com/MartinJuza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Martin Jůza</u></a>, who is project manager of the event and came up with the idea in the first place (and is also in Magic’s competitive Hall of Fame), says they truly wanted to make “the coolest event we can do for the community.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>If you’re not familiar with the concept of Cube, it’s an alternative way to play Magic where someone puts together a curated list of a few hundred cards to make a custom draft experience of their own design. Unlike a typical draft at your local store, players don’t keep the cards in their deck after the matches are over, as building a cube and tinkering with it over time can be quite an involved process for its creator as they dial in exactly what type of play experience they want it to provide. That could mean enabling specific strategies or playstyles, including your personal favorite cards just for a laugh, or gathering all the most powerful options across the 30-year history of this game. </p><p>In the case of MTGO’s Vintage Cube, which is seen by many as a sort of benchmark list due to both its official status and its easy availability, it means a mix of flashy new cards alongside some of the most infamous ones ever printed. For example, the entirety of the <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Nine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Power Nine</u></a> is available to draft if you’re lucky enough to open any of them, and there are plenty more cards that have never been reprinted thanks to Magic’s infamous <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Reserved_List" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reserved List</u></a>. </p><p>That’s what makes the prospect of doing a “for keeps” Vintage Cube draft — where the cards you pick for your deck are yours to take home — so unique and exciting. While the exact card list for this tournament has yet to be revealed, Daybreak has already committed to a few parameters for it, like including the Power Nine, the original dual lands, and all the other cards that have been in every iteration of MTGO’s cube over the years. On top of that, the goal is to make them all truly desirable versions of those cards, rather than cheap reprints or copies that are in terrible condition.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Daybreak has committed to including the Power Nine and all other cards that have been in every iteration of MTGO’s Vintage Cube.</p></div><p>“There’s so many versions of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/leb/211/llanowar-elves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Llanowar Elves</u></a> it would be trivial to find one that excited nobody,” Spain explains, “but it’s an iconic card beloved by many, me included, and it’s going to be much cooler for everybody when that card flips over and it’s a Beta Llanowar Elves instead of something from 2015.” In fact, Spain says any Common or Uncommon rarity cards that were originally printed in Magic’s first set will be versions from Beta at the latest, which will substantially increase both the monetary value and the nostalgic appeal of the entire cube.</p><p>The final list won’t look exactly like MTGO’s typical Vintage Cube lists either, as those frequently tend to experiment with newer cards or strategies – Spain even stated explicitly in <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/news/mtgo-vintagecubemay23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an article last year</u></a> that the MTGO cube was about “curating an engaging play experience, not a card museum.” He says this cube, however, actually <em>is </em>intended to be more of a mix of both. Similarly, Jůza says they are “aiming for pretty much the most old school version of the cube possible, so in a way we’re showcasing the last 30 years of Magic.” </p><p>The result of their dedication to not just doing this, but doing it <em>right</em>, is a cube that will be worth at least $65k in total. While each of the top eight competitors will only be going home with a slice of that pool, the odds are good that their cuts will still be worth a substantial amount. For reference, placing in the top eight of the <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/2023_World_Championship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 Magic World Championship</a> (which had a $1,000,000 prize pool) earned you $20k, which could hypothetically be surpassed by the value of this tournament’s Black Lotus alone depending on the card's printing and condition. Every player will draft 48 cards directly (three 16-card packs each), but not all of the 540-card Cube list will be opened this way, so winning matches with your deck will also earn you a bigger chunk of the leftovers.</p><p>For a community of Cube enthusiasts who are accustomed to handing their cards back after every draft, this event is sure to make a splash. I had the chance to ask Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/calebdmtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caleb Durward</a>, the winner of the inaugural <a href="https://cubecon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CubeCon</u></a> tournament back in 2022 and best known for his Vintage Cube content online, for his thoughts on this event ahead of the announcement, and he says “it’s a special thing for sure.”</p><p>“It’s not only a high, prestigious Cube event that you have to win a qualifier for to go and play,” which he says is a rare enough occurrence in the community, “but just the feel of actually drafting with those old cards is not something that everybody gets the chance to do these days.” Durward says even though he’s been privileged enough to draft paper cubes with real Power Nine cards in them before, it’s still exciting to do, and even just seeing others draft with the real cards for the first time can be very cool. </p><p>This tournament also feels like it couldn’t be coming at a better time for the format – while concept of Cube is by no means a new one, it has been going through a bit of a renaissance in recent years. Daybreak has been iterating more aggressively on its cube, Cube-focused community events like CubeCon and many more have been springing up, and some content creators are turning their focus toward it more regularly. Even Magic’s original creator, Richard Garfield, <a href="https://luckypaper.co/podcast/206-the-joy-of-gaming-with-richard-garfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recently expressed</u></a> his love for the format.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The final list hasn't been set yet, but its total value will be at least $65k. </p></div><p>Durward says there are a lot of factors to this boom, but in part praises how receptive Daybreak has been to feedback since it took over development of MTGO two years ago. Jůza points toward the popularity of fellow Hall of Famer <a href="https://x.com/lsv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luis Scott-Vargas</a>, who started posting daily Cube videos on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LSVargas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel</u></a> about a year ago. Meanwhile, Spain is wary of taking too much credit for anything when Cube is just so much fun on its own, describing it as “Commander for Limited” in how it brings big, exciting plays to the Draft experience. </p><p>To that end, Durward tells me that part of why he enjoys Cube so much is because it’s an “expressionistic” way to play Magic. “Because there are no bad cards in Cube, because all of the cards are designed for that environment and the power level is so high,” he explains, ”you can do different things with the game every single time you play it.” He compares drafting a Cube deck to painting with a brush, letting you follow whatever mood strikes you in a way that’s unique in the scheme of Magic drafting.</p><p>That said, Daybreak Product Manager Tony Mayer says “the curation element can't be understated” in terms of what has helped Cube flourish, at least when it comes to MTGO’s Vintage Cube. It’s typically only available to play during timed windows so that it doesn’t conflict with or distract from Magic’s main set releases – but the downtime has been getting briefer lately. Spain says that’s been influenced partially by the success of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MTG Arena</a>, Magic’s more recent digital client. It’s a platform that’s far more user friendly, making it appealing for things like drafting the newest sets, but it’s also far less comprehensive in its card pool and offerings, which leaves it unsuitable for something like Vintage Cube.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Look Inside Magic: The Gathering's "Hail, Caesar" Fallout Deck</h3></div></output><p>“Whereas before [Cube] was a filler, it’s now our main event,” says Spain, recognizing that the ecosystem has changed as Magic continues to grow. Mayer follows up by saying “we used to compare it to ‘Is it the McRib or is it the Big Mac?’ And the answer for us right now is something in between.” That philosophical shift has certainly impacted Cube’s growth, and without the newfound enthusiasm Daybreak has put toward the format we likely wouldn’t be seeing a tournament of this scale at all. </p><p>It’s fitting, then, that qualifying for the final event at MagicCon will involve (you guessed it) playing a whole lot of Cube on MTGO. More precise details will be shared in an official blog post later today, but a series of single-elimination qualifiers will take place over the next few months starting with a “Feeder League” that costs six Event Tickets (about $6 USD) or 80 Play Points to enter. Getting three match wins there will qualify you for a 64-person two-draft event later on, and winning <em>that</em> will get you access to one last qualifier draft to find the final eight for Las Vegas. So while anyone with a few spare bucks and the client installed can try their luck, reaching the top eight will essentially mean winning 12 Cube matches in a row across four different drafts leading up to MagicCon. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Whereas before [Cube] was a filler, it’s now our main event.” <em>- Ryan Spain, Daybreak</em></p></div><p>It’s by no means an easy task, but considering the prize on the line compared to the low initial entry price, it’s a remarkably accessible event for those who want to give it a shot. And given the opportunity is likely to attract all kinds of Magic players, I asked Durward and Jůza if they had any tips for folk who might be new to Cube that are hoping to win a Black Lotus of their own.</p><p>Jůza recommended doing some research about the cube ahead of time, watching videos of experienced players drafting, and when in doubt, drafting simple but reliable strategies like mono-red or mono-white aggro over trying to get too fancy. Durward’s advice echoed that last sentiment, though perhaps in a slightly more direct way:</p><p>“Attacking is always good. Just attack, just kill people.”</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor for games.
