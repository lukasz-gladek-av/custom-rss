<p>Whether you need to tune up your catch-as-catch-can holds or work on throwing meaner right hooks than Logan Paul, 2K offering WWE 2K25 Early Access would have many ready, willing, and Gable to buy.</p>



<p>2K’s multimedia sports game empire is a winner every year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> is the natural successor to WWE 2K24, and is looking to be the Apex Predator of the group. More and more games offer Early Access, and WWE 2K25 is a natural fit for the incentive.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> already has it, so I’m here to tell you if you can expect it from WWE 2K25.</p>

<p><strong>WWE 2K25 offers 7-Day Early Access as a bonus for those who pre-order the Deadman</strong> <strong>Edition and Bloodline Editions.</strong></p>



<p>WWE 2K25’s Early Access is a chance to get stuck into MyGM, Universe Mode, and explore The Island as an early adopter. You can learn the new mechanics, get an Edge (pun intended) on other newbies, and become the King or Queen of the Ring.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wwe-2k25-early-access">How to Play WWE 2K25 Early Access</h2>



<p>Three editions await those who want to secure their copy before launch: The Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and Bloodline Edition. The final two are the key for Early Access. Pre-order the Deadman or Bloodline Edition for a seven-day headstart over the competition.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to secure this big bonus:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25’s website</a>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>pre-order now</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll down <strong>and choose either the Deadman or Bloodline Edition</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose your platform.</li>



<li>Press <strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;to go to the storefront you desire.</li>



<li>Again, choose the newer&nbsp;<strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;button.</li>



<li>Purchase the edition and confirm it.</li>



<li>You can download and play Early Access when it begins.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-when-does-wwe-2k25-early-access-start">When Does WWE 2K25 Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Early Access for WWE 2K25 begins on March 7, giving you seven full days to enjoy WWE 2K25 before it launches worldwide on March 14.</strong></p>



<p>If you think I’m telling an Eddie Guerrero-sized lie, I promise I haven’t cheated you, and I’ll steal the official confirmation from 2K itself. On the official <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/37145831078163--WWE-2K25-Pre-Order-and-Edition-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 FAQ</a>, it says: “Standard Editions can start their throw-down journey on March 14, and the early access for pre-orders of Deadman and The Bloodline Editions will get access starting March 7.”</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you prepared to pay a bit more and secure your ticket to the dance? Or will you turn down the offer and take the brunt of a John Cena heel turn?</p>



<p>It’s not exactly from the dirt sheets, but many other WWE 2K25 details are known. This year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-showcase-mode-matches-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase Matches</a> are announced, and we know all about 2K25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-wwe-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> eligibility.</p>

Along with the usual four face buttons on the right side of the control, you’ll find two additional face buttons as R1 and R2. All six face buttons utilize microswitches, which Hori states were used to increase the accuracy and durability of the inputs.</p><p>Even with R1 and R2 moving to the front of the controller, the Octa Pro still has four tactile shoulder buttons. You can also map inputs to the pair of remappable back buttons.</p><p>The 8-gate analog stick was designed with fighting games in mind, so diagonal inputs should be easier to execute on the Octa Pro compared to a standard controller. Inside the box, you'll find three hot-swappable D-pad designs. Hori also added a low-profile "analog slide pad" that resembles the Switch's Circle Pad. The slide pad is meant to be used in menu systems.</p><p>The controller is wireless, though it does include a USB-C cable for charging and wired play. It comes with a cable lock to mitigate the risk of a disconnection during a match. Hori says the the controller can run for roughly 10 hours between charges. In addition to the USB-C port, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You’ll find a cable lock feature on the back of the gamepad--so you can lock the cable in place to ensure it doesn’t disconnect during the heat of battle. Expect to get around 10 hours of game time per charge. While the Octa Pro is technically compatible with PS4, it can only be used in wired mode on PlayStation's last-gen console.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, a more affordable variation of the controller is already available--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-PlayStation-Fighting-Commander-OCTA-5/dp/B09RQTTWPQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Commander Octa</a>. It’s not quite as robust as the upcoming Pro model, but this $59 wired controller still features an 8-way analog stick, six face buttons, and support for PS5, PS4, and PC. </p><p>Beyond the Commander Octa lineup, we've rounded up a handful of other fightpads and traditional fight sticks that are worth checking out if you're looking for a dedicated option for your favorite fighting games. </p><h2>More Fightpads and Fight Sticks to Consider</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PDP-Victrix-Wireless-Controller-Playstation-5/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PDP Victrix Pro BFG Wireless Controller (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $175</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-PlayStation-Fighting-Stick-Alpha-5/dp/B09RQV4786?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Stick Alpha (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $172 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Fighting-Stick-Alpha-TEKKEN-5/dp/B0CJ9QMHWD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Stick Alpha: Tekken Edition (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $172 (<del>$230</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Fighting-Stick-Mini-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CKB9WK3F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Stick Mini (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $52 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kitsune All-Button Arcade Controller (PS5, PC)</a> -- $294</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro Leverless Fight Stick (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $250</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQKGHW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS-12 All-Button (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $384</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQXXJR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $380 (<del>$400</del>)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4453705-mixcollage-04-mar-2025-09-23-am-6577.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453705" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4453705-mixcollage-04-mar-2025-09-23-am-6577.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453705"></a><figcaption>Hori Wireless Fighting Commander Octa Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4453705-mixcollage-04-mar-2025-09-23-am-6577.jpg"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched in February to critical acclaim and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">more than 2 million in sales</a>, but the game debuted with no ability to give your character, Henry, a look of your own choosing. That's set to change soon, as developer Warhorse has announced that Barber Mode is coming to the RPG in mid-March, and it'll allow players to change their hair and beard style. This mode was first announced in January when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Warhorse revealed the game's post-launch content roadmap.</a></p><p>This was announced as part of a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2392565307" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch livestream</a>, during which Warhorse showed off the new beard and hair styles. Reddit user Valmont_DE captured some images from the stream, which show off how players will be able to customize Henry's look when the update arrives.</p><p>As you can see, the Barber mode will allow players to customize Henry's hair and facial hair, and there are plenty of options to choose from to help make him look how you want.</p><p>The developer livestream also dug into new details around Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Hardcore mode</a>, which Warhorse said is a "more difficult and immersive way" of playing the RPG, <a href="https://gamerant.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hair-beard-styles-revealed-barber-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant reported</a>. In Hardcore mode, some helpful UI elements will be limited in and out of combat, while your player's location is never shown on the map, so you have to find a way on your own. Additionally, fast travel is disabled, and players can choose "negative perks" to make the game harder.</p><p>Following these free updates, Warhorse will release new story expansions for Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance through the game's paid expansion pass. These story expansions include Brushes with Death in Summer 2025 and Legacy of the Forge in Fall 2025. A third expansion, Mysteria Ecclesia, is set for release in Winter 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/merchants-of-rosewall-review-shop-management-visual-novel-with-twist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Big Blue Sky Games' first title, <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em>, is a blend between a visual novel and store manager with a unique take on crafting. It’s an impressive first outing for the indie studio. Not only is there a complete and well-thought-out storyline along with the distinct management mechanics, but there are multiple NPCs and a cozy art style to go with it.</p>

<h2>Stock the Shelves in <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> Shop Simulation</h2>

<p>The story begins with you arriving in Rosewall. You’re part of a merchant program that aims to strengthen relations between the Estoiq Trading Company (ETC) and the city. You’re in charge of a shop, though the ETC owns it and the land the building is on. Maintaining your merchant status comes at a cost, with strict requirements set by the program.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-tailor-companion.jpg?itok=aVWq8TPa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-tailor-companion.jpg?itok=QiUZiruT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the shop management part of <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> comes in. To get inventory, you need to hire members of the various crafting guilds. Cooks, masons, smiths, artists, tailors, and woodworkers are all waiting to be hired, though not at the same time. As you work through the first couple months of the game you’ll get letters announcing when someone is available to join you.</p>

<p>Companions specialize in a certain craft and rank from S to E. The higher the rank, the more they can produce. Not only that, but the chance of creating extra merchandise or being able to craft another set of items for the day increases. This can come into play if you have, for example, too many artists and not enough tailors to fabricate the products you want on the day you need. You can assign one of the artists to the Tailor workshop by looking at the rankings and selecting the best candidate for the job.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-companion-menu.jpg?itok=NsRmSkoS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-companion-menu.jpg?itok=Ld9U0hQ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The different crafting specialties are all related to each other, especially as the recipes become more complex later in the game. A smith may make regular steins, while multiple cooks craft some ale, and a woodcutter puts on the final touches to a set of Ornate Steins. Some of the best items to create are the ones that take a variety of companions to produce.</p>

<p>I really loved this interconnectedness. Not only is it more realistic, but it can make things especially difficult to create. It’s a new challenge that evolves with the game, requiring more to make an expensive item then just pricey materials. It also means that not every employee will produce a unique item to go on the shelf. With sales goals in mind, this can be the difference between failure and continuing on.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-crafting-smith-workshop.jpg?itok=SLwPVmgO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-crafting-smith-workshop.jpg?itok=aYKdoaNH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Companions don’t only craft inventory, but they act as your salespeople, stockers, and greeters. These store skills are ranked the same way as crafting skills, impacting how much you can bump prices, bring in customers, and keep merchandise on the shelves. The likelihood that any companion is idle during a day at the shop is rare.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Delve into Rosewall History</h2>

<p>Woven between daily crafting is the narrative of <em>Merchants of Rosewall.</em> Styled like a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a8cd461c-31ce-4af9-b6d2-6a804d37d2a0" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/visual-novel" rel="nofollow">visual novel</a>, you accidentally swallow a bit of elemental energy known as a Memory, and stumble onto a mystery that could impact how Rosewall currently functions.&nbsp;Most of the NPC interactions and world exploration take place during these story moments.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-seagull.jpg?itok=cXv5qQ5J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-seagull.jpg?itok=w8XuMdEf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Choices made during dialogue exchanges don’t necessarily matter as the story progresses in a linear fashion. You’ll often find yourself going through all the available options before being able to move on. That’s simply because there are multiple pieces of the puzzle that have to be explored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing the narrative elements taken seriously and not as a quick addition to create breaks to the shop keeping made me quite excited. It’s not a straightforward story with little thought put into it. There are even plot twists that took me by surprise, which I really enjoyed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Bugs</h2>

<p>While the game operates smoothly, for the most part, there are some issues with it. First is the biggest one, a failure to mark a quest step as complete when the required Renown level is reached. This blocks progression, causing you to fail, ending your journey in Rosewall.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-critical-bug.jpg?itok=zpGsNC-x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-critical-bug.jpg?itok=pZculPmh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another issue, though it’s a boon to players, is that companions assigned to a store task the day before, can remain assigned there even though they’ve crafted something. Typically, Companions are only able to do one task per day. This is seen when you go into the storefront menu. Companions assigned to workshops are grayed out, unable to be moved to a shop position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, one may fill the slot they were in previously. If you don’t replace that Companion or take them out of the lineup, you’ll get the bonus from that slot, even though you’re not supposed to. This makes the game easier, so it’s not the worst bug, but one nonetheless.</p>

<h2><em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> is an endearing entry in the shop management genre. Not only is the way you operate the shop different from other titles, it also has an interesting story laced throughout. Progression-blocking bugs can be problematic if encountered, but Big Blue Sky Games developers are already working on solutions. Whether you’re interested in management games or visual novels, <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> is a title to check out.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, Activision has confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remaster-supposedly-being-shadow-dropped-at-xbox-game-showcase-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier rumors</a> that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is indeed in development and will be released on July 11 on all leading gaming platforms, including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. Truth be told, leakier extas1s said it would be shadow-dropped during Microsoft's Xbox Game Showcase in June, but July certainly isn't too far off that mark.</p>
<p>Anyway, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is coming, which is the most important thing for fans after the skater himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a false start a while ago when Vicarious Visions got merged with Blizzard. This time, the remake is being made by Iron Galaxy, the developer that was behind the PC port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> and also the studio picked by Naughty Dog to port both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II to the PC platform.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 includes everything in the original, plus new skaters and parks, extra tricks, and new tracks to crank up. Iron Galaxy says that the parks from both games have been authentically recreated with streamlined goals in a two-minute format. New parks include the so-called Waterpark with its grindable slides and a drained lazy river that's tailor-made for vert trick combos.</p>
<p>Through in-game challenges, players will earn in-game cash and access new gear, including new decks, grip tapes and wheels for their boards, and extra apparel for their skaters. Cross-platform online multiplayer supports up to eight skaters at a time. Iron Galaxy also added a New Game+ mode where players can retain the stats they had previously earned in their first playthrough.</p>
<p>Newcomers should have an easier way in thanks to an in-game tutorial led by Tony Hawk himself, featuring lessons on the all-important Ollie, kick flips, vert tricks, grinds, reverts, manuals, special tricks, and more. Last but not least, the original soundtrack has been expanded with new music.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-PedsiljOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-ordering Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch will provide access to the Foundry Demo due to launch in June, including two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs. Players who pre-order the game will also gain instant access to the in-game Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>
<p>As offered by pretty much all games nowadays, the Digital Deluxe Edition lets players in before the official July 11 launch date. That's on top of the following in-game bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Doom Slayer:&nbsp;</b>Play as Doom Slayer, featuring a Standard and Retro outfit plus two unique special tricks and the Unmaykr Hoverboard.</sub></li>

            <p>Every now and then we publish a round-up of game or demo recommendations, and all you regular readers dutifully fill the comments with recommendations of your own. FOOLS.

You know in Batman Forever when Jim Carrey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAjgzwFHXd4">uses Riddler TV to steal everybody's IQs</a>?

<p>Batman Forever is the wrong analogy for this news piece. Let's get back on track. I learned about Moadra from a comment by Galactic Man on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">our latest Steam Fest demo round-up</a>, Developed by Gloomsoft, it casts you as a dinkier species of Predator, scouring inky catacombs of corpseflesh for a missing alien princess.</p>
<p>That's the plan, anyway, until you find the princess and she rips your gun-arm off. Fortunately, a fugitive boffin soon hooks you up with a new arm comprised of evolving primordial muck. Thanks to this timely injection of locally grown biomatter, you gain access to an upgrades tree with unlockable appendages such as Morrigan-style vampire wings. Then you set off afresh to find that pesky princess and, I imagine, rip <em>her</em> arms off. I think Moadra has the right attitude toward monarchy so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713730/Moadra/">The Steam demo</a> plays a lot like the more recent iterations of Metroid, with a fast, nimble protagonist who can crawl into chutes (no Samusball functionality, alas) and charge up projectiles that bounce from certain surfaces. The backdrop is straight out of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>, however. Everything looks like the inside of a sickly lung. Such technology as may be found is busted and unclean.</p>
<p>A smaller point of differentiation: you shoot doors to open them, as in Metroid, but in Moadra - oh, I'm just picking up on the fact that "Moadra" sounds like "Metroid" through the Predator's voicebox! - you shoot them to activate short-ranged teleporters that flense you apart and put you back together in the next room. To ask the age-old question regarding teleporters, am I dying every time I use one, with my atoms and memories then forming a brand new being?</p>
<p>Honestly, if that's the worst thing that happens in Moadra I'll be thankful. There's a bossfight that basically traps you inside a cybernetic stomach with a brace of turrets and the head of a bellowing rat ogre. There's also some scanner functionality care of a flying drone pal that naturally harkens forward to Metroid's first 3D incarnation, Metroid Prime. Perhaps a cloaking device as well, Gloomsoft?</p>
<p>Will Moadra stand apart from Metroid in hindsight or will it prove to be just the same old metroidvania fittings coated in squirming filth, like a Samus figurine retrieved from the toilet? I'm not sure, but I look forward to finding out. There's no release date yet. Thanks again, Galactic Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When Donald Trump was running for reelection in 2024, he constantly spoke about his desire to add tariffs--or import taxes--on America's trading partners and rivals. Now, President Trump has gone through with that threat by imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The Chinese tariffs are on top of the 10% tariff that Trump ordered on the country last month. Taken together, this new round of tariffs may spell trouble for physical video games, according to an industry analyst.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ljkknpfsa22x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that physical video games that would be subject to these tariffs may simply not be made. Instead, publishers are likely to lean even harder on digital sales. Piscatella has previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-new-tariffs-could-lead-to-more-expensive-video-games-expert-says/1100-6528904/" data-ref-id="1100-6528904">written about the potential impact</a> of these tariffs, while noting that manufacturing game discs in America isn't a viable option since physical sales have been declining for years.</p><p>During Trump's first term in office, the video game industry successfully lobbied his administration to exclude them from the tariffs he placed on Chinese goods. There was no carveout in Trump's newest round of tariffs. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a public statement earlier this month warning that these tariffs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-warns-trump-tariffs-could-harm-the-video-game-industry/1100-6529197/" data-ref-id="1100-6529197">may have a devastating affect on all video game sales</a>.</p><p>Because the costs of tariffs are almost always passed to customers, it's the American consumer who will bear the brunt of these expenses. Piscatella has also indicated that the price of games--both physical and digital--may rise in response to Trump's tariffs. There's also fear that the tariffs could trigger an economic downturn or even a recession, which would further hurt players' ability to afford games.</p>

                <p>During its developer livestream on March 4, Bungie confirmed that Destiny 2's IO planet is coming back to the game. It will be the one of the locations where the new Heresy Act 2 activity, Court of Blades, will take place.</p><p>IO was sunset back in 2020 with the launch of Beyond Light to a critical response from players. In recent years, Bungie has also reprised formerly sunset planets including Mars, which was home to Savathun's Throne World, and Titan, where we rediscovered Sloane. This time around, IO's Remnants of Silver area will be the home of a new activity inspired by the roguelike elements that Bungie has been playing with in recent months.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453845" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453845"></a><figcaption>The return of IO's Remnant of Silver area</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg"></figure><p>IO is completely engulfed in Darkness, which Oryx, The Taken King, is desperately seeking out to regain power following his discovery that the Guardians were the ones to kill him. As he heads to IO, players will take part in the new Court of Blades activity and have direct interactions with him for the first time in years.</p><p>The Court of Blades is a matchmade activity designed to feel unique and challenging on each run. Bungie says it has "borrowed the concept of Augmentations from Onslaught" but that they differ in this case, as they provide challenges that players can find other ways to overcome. The Court of Blades also features a randomized set of armaments that are available for purchase between phases in order to combat those challenges.</p><p>Building a loadout will differ from day to day. Augmentations, the challenges applied to each run, begin to stack the more players complete the activity. It's possible to get a good combination that makes the run simple to complete, or a bad combination of certain bosses or Augmentations that just don't work together well. "We wanted players to have opportunities to shortcut those challenges, or combine the armaments to find a cool combo," Bungie says. Armaments will rotate on a daily basis, and Bungie hopes that this will generate a new meta each day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453846"></a><figcaption>Court of Blades Augmentation UI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Court of Blades activity is designed to take "around 10 minutes," activity designer Quentin Quinones-Rezin said during the livestream. There won't be any raid-like mechanics, nor will there be the health scaling seen in Act 1's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/" data-ref-id="1100-6529277">Nether</a> activity. "This is intended to be a bit of a less stressful, more fun activity, but the difficulty does escalate after every two challengers," continues Quinones-Rezin. The mechanics that Guardians can buy as armaments will sometimes provide antidotes or shortcuts to the Augmentations. Some you may recognize from the Nether, some will be brand new, and some will be borrowed from Exotics. For example, the Sunbracers effect can now be purchased in the Court of Blades using its currency, and could be effectively combined with something that increases ability regeneration.</p><p>Court of Blades will also feature an Expert mode for players looking for a challenge. While completing the Court of Blades activity will drop the Aptitude <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-destiny-2-heresy-weapons/1100-6529285/" data-ref-id="1100-6529285">Heresy weapons </a>more frequently, their Adept versions will only drop in Expert mode.</p>

            <p>
Sony has launched a new "centralised" Beta Program initiative for PlayStation, providing an easy way for the public to sign up help test PlayStation 5 and PC games, as well as various console and app features, ahead of their full release.
</p>
<p>
Sony describes PlayStation's Beta Program as a "easy, centralised place" where players can register to participate in a range of different betas. These are expected to include beta access to PlayStation 5 and PC games, PlayStation 5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even features for Sony's PlayStation website. Anyone interested in participating only needs to sign up once - invites will be send out automatically if a registered user is selected for a specific test, and they're then free to accept or decline that invition as they see fit.
</p>
<p>
"While we try to include as many players as possible in our beta programs," Sony explains in its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/">announcement on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "sometimes we may get more interest than we can accommodate. By joining this program, it enables you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee selection for a beta test."
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
Players can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/">sign up via the 'Beta Program at PlayStation' website</a>, but Sony notes a PlayStation Network account is required and must be in good standing with a current email address. Additionally, participants must meet the legal age requirement in their region, and can only participate when a specific beta test is available in that region.
</p>
<p>
"A big thanks to those of you who have participated in all of the betas we've offered across Sony Interactive over the years," it concludes. "It's about to get easier and more convenient."

Activision officially announced the new release — called <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> — which will include remakes of both seminal skateboarding games and is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and the Switch on July 11th. It’ll also be available for subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">the previous remakes</a>, the new collection will include all of the content from the original games, alongside some modern additions, including brand-new parks and a handful of current skaters like Olympic stars Rayssa Leal and Yuto Horigome. They’ll join the original cast, including the likes of Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and, obviously, Tony Hawk.</p><p>The new game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, which worked with Vicarious Visions — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244924/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-remake-studio-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment-merger">now a part of Blizzard</a> — on the previous remake. Here’s a little before-and-after image comparing the original games to the updated version:</p><p>Activision says that the soundtrack — always an important part of a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game — will include classic songs from Motörhead, Gang Starr, KRS-One, and others, “alongside new tracks that capture the spirit of modern skate culture.” The game will also support cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p><p>The original remakes were well-received updates of some true classics, and the new game will be launching at a very interesting time for skateboarding games. In addition to clever indie releases like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">Skate City</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">OlliOlli World</a></em>, and the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a></em>, EA is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23189958/ea-skate-trailer-progress-update-playtest-sign-up">bringing back its long-dormant <em>Skate</em> series</a>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remaster of the third and fourth games in the franchise, has been officially revealed. The reveal comes after weeks of rumors and teases about the game’s announcement.</p>



<p>Launching on July 11—confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-3-4-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier leak</a>—Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will feature the game’s original parks with a “classic roster of skaters”. There will also be new parks, skaters, and tricks for all players to experience on all platforms.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Skate through a robust Career mode taking on challenges across two tours, chase high scores in Single Sessions and Speedruns, or chill out and dig into the map in Free Skate,” Activision said via release. </p>



<p>The game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, the team that handled the development of the Steam version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Vicarious Visions, which initially developed the first remaster, was merged into Blizzard back in 2021 and rebranded as Blizzard Albany.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game  will have cross-platform multiplayer supporting up to eight players at once. There will also be a New Game+ mode for players that want to play through the career multiple times without losing their stats.</p>



<p>When it launches, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>



<p>Those who pre-order the game will get access to the Foundry Demo in June. Lastly, players who buy the Digital Deluxe edition will get access to Doom Slayer and Revenant skaters along with extra in-game music, skate decks, and create-a-skater gear alongside three days early access on July 8.</p>

<p>It has just been announced that Escape from Tarkov Arena, the session-based multiplayer platform set in the EFT universe, is coming to the Epic Games Store. This marks the first time that an Escape from Tarkov title will be introduced to a digital storefront outside of Battlestate Games’ launcher and store.</p>



<p>It wasn’t given a release date, but users can wishlist Escape from Tarkov Arena on the Epic Games Store <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-surprising-change">Surprising Change</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been the most popular extraction shooter for almost a decade. In December 2023, Battlestate Games released Escape from Tarkov Arena, a traditional multiplayer shooter with smaller maps, faster modes, and classic loadout mechanics. It was well received, but it has admittedly died off quite considerably in the months that have followed.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Wishlist Escape from </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Tarkov</a><span>: Arena now! </span><a href="https://epic.gm/tarkov-arena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic.gm/tarkov-arena</a><span>

Intense, hardcore close-quarters PvP battles with realistic weapon mechanics, and advanced ballistics are coming your way. Are you ready to dominate the Arena?</span></p></article></div>







<p>Earlier today, Epic Games Store revealed that EFT Arena would be debuting on the platform <strong>soon</strong>. This is a landmark move, as Escape from Tarkov, and by extension, Arena, have only been purchasable directly from Battlestate Games since they were respectively released.</p>



<p>The team released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement:</p>

<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - Epic Games Store trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Wmz3Yh_3xU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This is likely a bid to make Escape from Tarkov more accessible, with the hope that by making Arena more readily available, it’ll entice people to check out the full ‘version’ of Escape from Tarkov. For now, that’s still locked to Battlestate Games’ platforms and isn’t on Steam, Epic Games Store, or any other digital storefront.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov Arena is a great shooter, but it’s quite punishing – just like the full extraction shooter. It boasts a fairly realistic operating model, and it’s easy to come up against overpowered enemies. This also isn’t <strong>really </strong>a shooter for anyone who mains a game like Call of Duty – it’s not an arcade game at all, and it can’t be played with a controller.</p>



<p>Watch this space to learn when Escape from Tarkov Arena <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will be released on Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-review.1125147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After winning the Game of the Year gong for It Takes Two at the The Game Awards 2021 I’m certain that developer Hazelight Studios was positively brimming with ideas of what to do next. I’m certain of this because the team appears to have used every one of those ideas in Split Fiction. An enchanting and confident two-person adventure like no other, Split Fiction is non-stop, co-op satisfaction that had me smiling consistently as we progressed, parkoured, and pulverised our way through to one of the best finales I’ve ever played. Is it a puzzle platformer? Is it a third-person action adventure? Is it an extreme sports game, or a side-scroller, or a twin-stick shooter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is yes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is the story of two young and unsuccessful authors, Zoe and Mio, lured to a mysterious tech company by the prospect of finally being published. What they didn’t count on, however, was having their brains strip mined of every story they’ve ever conceived. When a scuffle involving a suspicious Mio thrusts her into Zoe’s personal instance within the computer system, the two find themselves forced to work together to escape and foil the company’s plot. Zoe and Mio are quickly and effectively established as polar opposites in everything from their attitudes to their accents, but Split Fiction wastes little time tossing them together. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Split Fiction is two proud middle fingers to the conga line of entitled tech bros who’ve decided art is a commodity that can be scraped, stolen, and repackaged by their plagiarism engines.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an easy-to-grasp premise, and it’s almost baffling that it hasn't come along in a dozen games already. That is, the idea of being trapped in an interactive, virtual world is a trope that’s been remixed repeatedly in film for decades. Of course, Split Fiction nonetheless arrives in 2025 as a particularly timely takedown of our grim future of being drenched in AI slop against our will. The fact that, at its heart, Split Fiction is two proud middle fingers to the conga line of entitled tech bros who’ve decided art is a commodity that can be scraped, stolen, and repackaged by their plagiarism engines only adds to its charm.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Non-friction</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with It Takes Two before it, Split Fiction’s platforming is immediately on point. With a jump, double-jump, and air dash at each character’s disposal, Split Fiction boasts the same high degree of aerial maneuverability as its predecessor. Wall runs can be spectacularly chained, grappling hooks are thrilling swings or slingshots, and rails, poles, and tiny landing spots have a soft lock that draws Zoe and Mio onto them – so long as you’ve pointed them largely in the right direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is a movement system that’s extremely approachable and easy to become adept with quite fast, and one that focuses on momentum and timing rather than getting too bogged down punishing tiny mistakes or a lack of expert-level finesse. It’s like having just one bumper up in a bowling alley; it’s happy to give you a slight nudge in the right direction on occasion, but it’s not going to render you immune from making mistakes entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My only real criticism of the platforming is that there are a few occasions where it becomes tricky to catch up after falling behind your partner, as one player hurtles ahead and the other gets stuck in a brief loop of dying and respawning trying to get back on track. It’s also a minor bugbear having both Zoe and Mio simply clipping through each other whenever they occupy the same space, as it results in a surprisingly unfinished look. Make no mistake, having one character become an actual obstacle for the other would totally destroy the snappy pace of Split Fiction, but it would’ve looked so much better (and still made perfect sense) with some kind of digitised effect breaking up Zoe and Mio’s avatars whenever they found themselves perched on the same tiny platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, Split Fiction’s fast-paced platforming is perfect for its exclusively co-op approach, particularly when played by people of differing skill levels, as it’s mostly frictionless. Die outside of a boss battle and you’ll rapidly respawn near your partner automatically. Die <em>within </em>a boss battle and you can re-enter the fray after some brief button mashing. Checkpoints are generously frequent, even during boss fights. Chip their health down to halfway and you won’t need to repeat an encounter entirely, even if both Zoe and Mio are defeated at the same time. This is welcome because, as incredibly imaginative as the many bosses are, it’s not unusual to suffer a couple of cheap deaths during the fights – commonly after getting respawned under a salvo of deadly attacks that wipe you out the instant you blink back into existence. As such they were only ever brief setbacks, and we never had to repeat anything to the degree it felt like a chore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall it’s not a particularly difficult game for, say, two dads with somewhere in the vicinity 80 years of video game literacy between them, but I don’t crave punishing difficulty and never have. For me Split Fiction soars thanks to its satisfying focus on communication, collaboration, and constant variety. It’s figuring out the path and the joy of suggesting the right puzzle solution. It’s laughing at untimely misunderstandings knowing the penalty for failure is never especially severe. It’s deciding whether to go on three, or if it’s one, two, three, <em>GO!</em> Split Fiction is nothing if not a game that makes you know what it would feel like to need your best friend to drag you off your booby-trapped toilet before it explodes. You’ve all seen Lethal Weapon 2, right? I did mention we’re a pair of 40-year-old dads, yeah?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Split Fiction is nothing if not a game that makes you know what it would feel like to need your best friend to drag you off your booby-trapped toilet before it explodes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Watching two of my kids play after I’ve finished it I’ve since seen a couple of possible bottlenecks (related to timing their way past a deadly obstacle) but if less experienced players have no one around to swoop in and save the day, the option to simply skip forward to the next checkpoint is available as a last resort. Split Fiction doesn’t want to stall anyone indefinitely. It wants to be played.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Clever, bending story</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring. If you’ve ever wondered whether it would be possible to squeeze SSX and Shadow of the Colossus into the same story, wonder no more. Split Fiction found a way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe and Mio are fantasy and sci-fi authors respectively, and the action is essentially divided equally between the two genres, but the fantasy and sci-fi branches of Split Fiction are anything but static. That is, the story doesn’t pendulum between a single sci-fi world and a single fantasy world repeatedly for 14-hours – the levels are always different, each with their own special hooks. Mio’s mental archive of sci-fi ideas range from a neon-splashed, futuristic city full of flying traffic – with gravity-defying cyber ninjas that will have you and a partner helping each other down a high-altitude highway while operating on <em>totally different axes</em> – to a space complex next to a dying star releasing pulsing blasts that will disintegrate Zoe and Mio if they’re caught out of cover. That’s just two, and I’m extremely hesitant to drill down on any more. Not knowing how each new level and side story will shake up the backdrop and the gameplay is a huge part of what makes Split Fiction such tremendous fun to scoot through. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe’s fantasy worlds are initially a bit twee by comparison, and generally had me looking forward to the short sci-fi diversions that are scattered throughout, but they do feature the better boss battles (I’m reluctant to spoil the specifics of any of those either but, broadly speaking, the fantasy bosses are more impressive in size and have personalities than make them vastly more memorable). The fantasy portion does peak later in the story as it becomes a little darker and more grand-scale, which is a good springboard for the lengthy and meticulously engineered final level. It’s not just the most impressively executed stretch of Split Fiction overall; it’s one of the most memorable finales I’ve ever played. Split Fiction is a fine-looking game throughout, but the spectacle of the entire ending segment is a real visual victory for Hazelight.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-is-a-gorgeous-roguelite-from-the-makers-of-streets-of-rage-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Streets of Rage 4 developer Guard Crush Games is once again partnering up with publisher Dotemu for a beat-’em-up. This time, though, it’s Dotemu’s first original IP, with gorgeous hand-drawn-styled animation from Supamonks and a soundtrack by decorated video game score composer Gareth Coker. That’s a lot of talent on one unproven project, but if my hourlong hands-on with that project – it’s called Absolum – is any indication, it’s not going to be unproven for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Absolum is a roguelite side-scrolling beat-’em-up action-RPG designed for, in the developers’ words, “deep replayability with branching paths to explore, quests, characters, and challenging bosses.” I can attest to all of those things being true. It’s an absolutely gorgeous fantasy romp with multiple player classes – I got to try out the tank-y dwarf-like Karl and the lank-y ranger-ish sword-wielding Galandra – where you kill evil creatures, smash up the environments (often hoping a carrot or other health-replenishing pickup will reveal itself), duck into the occasional building to pop open treasure chests or get ambushed by goblins, battle bosses with gargantuan health bars, die, and repeat the whole thing over again. Oh, and though I didn’t get to try it, you can also play two-player same-screen co-op. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For me, someone who has fond memories of many a two-player beat-’em-up back in 1980’s and early-’90s arcades as well as games like Golden Axe on the Sega Genesis, Absolum felt nostalgically familiar in a good way – perhaps owing to its Saturday morning cartoon-style art and animation. And you’ve got a relatively shallow but nevertheless slightly layered two-button combat system that allows you to mix up attacks depending on the enemy in front of you. But the roguelite element modernizes it in a way that gives it both an edge and a ton of obvious built-in replayability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you go, you’ll discover both hidden and obvious power-ups – some are equippable active weapons or spells that are activated by pulling one of the triggers and then hitting the corresponding face button, and others are passives that live in your inventory. All will randomize from one run to the next, but not all the items are necessarily desirable. Or at least, there’s a serious risk-reward system that might change your approach in that run. For instance, in one early run, I picked up not one but TWO orbs that gave me a 20% boost to damage, but at the expense of 20% of my health. So with both of them I had a frighteningly small health bar, but I could dispatch enemies pretty quickly. Fortunately, you can drop any item from your inventory at any time if you’d rather not deal with the trade-off of a particular power-up.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Absolum - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I did say this is a roguelite, so that means when – not if – you die, the realm you return to has a shop where you can spend in-game currency to buy items or power-ups for the next run. This wasn’t fully working yet in the early build I played, leaving me at the whim of what amounted to a dice roll regarding the quality of items and power-ups on each new run. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Absolum has a ton of potential, and dare I say even a high probability of being good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because I couldn’t spend any of the hard-earned gold in between runs, I had a heck of a time with the first major boss – who I sadly don’t have footage of, but at least I can show you another, later boss that looks far tougher. But mine was a mammoth troll that swung a gigantic mace, and who’d summon smaller goblins, some of whom would leap onto you and start biting away at your face like they were piranhas. I would’ve loved to have gotten a chance to experience two-player co-op, as it would not only split the boss’s attention, but as anyone who shares those fond memories of the beat-’em-ups of yore knows, these kinds of games shine brightest in two-player mode. Always. Every single time. No exceptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, between the art style, animation, old-school side-scrolling beat-’em-up gameplay, and roguelite loop – not to mention the developer’s pedigree in this genre – Absolum has a ton of potential, and dare I say even a high probability of being good. If you’ve been lamenting the loss of couch co-op games over the years, Absolum is almost certainly one that’s going to stem that tide, at least for a little while. I’m very much looking forward to playing a more polished build as development progresses, but for now, I’m incredibly optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

The new mode allows players to choose from two heroes as voted on by their team, letting players hit the field as one of them. This means that you can field an entire team of Iron Men or Venoms, and some of the other combinations here are <em>wild</em>.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="370850989" data-promo-id="0"

                <p>PlayStation has unveiled a new beta program that will make it easier to access game betas, test out new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a> and PlayStation App features early, and more.</p><p>Aptly called the "Beta Program at PlayStation," this new initiative is similar to the Xbox Insider program Microsoft currently runs for its gaming hardware and apps. Sony Interactive Entertainment's Sid Shuman describes this program as "an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas" in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>. Essentially, players can now register at the program's official website and be in the loop on future beta initiatives by Sony.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453759" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="1077" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453759"></a><figcaption>The official key art for the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg"></figure><p>By signing up for the Beta Program at PlayStation, players will essentially be enrolled for a chance to gain beta access to future software betas that Sony holds for PlayStation. The PlayStation Blog post specifically calls out beta tests for PS5 and PC games, new PS5 console and PlayStation App features, and new UI capabilities on PlayStation.com. Companies like Sony need to thoroughly test games and software updates before they release them to the masses. This new program gives Sony a way to involve fans in that process.</p><p>While the website is down as of the writing of this article, the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a website of its own </a>where interested PlayStation fans can sign up for free. All you need is to meet the age and region requirements and to have an active PlayStation Network account with no restrictions or violations currently applied to it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/update-1-1-0-for-civilization-vii-launched-adds-natural-wonder-and-needed-updates/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Firaxis has launched the next update for Civilization VII, which has made some of the changes listed from the content roadmap that they released. Most of the content from the update are updates and suggestions that have been left by the community and the feedback provided. Below are some of the highlights of the update.</p>
<p>First is the new Natural Wonder that all players will be able to discover for free, which is the Bermuda Triangle. Cross-play between PC and consoles will also be re-enabled when this update releases. The update includes UI adjustments and addressing reported issues from the dedicated community.</p>
<p>For those that manage to make it to the Modern Age, there have now been some major changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory, as AI leaders have now been given a better opportunity at completing a Cultural Victory. This means that players can expect to see fewer Explorer Unit stacks scattered across the map.</p>
<p>Those going for a Religious Victory will now be able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. When players create their own Missionary Units, they will automatically follow the player's chosen Religion.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">Dispersing Independent Powers</a> is a large part of Civilization VII, and previously, land units were the only ones able to disperse them. Now, Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers, which can be incredibly helpful if you don't have units in that area.</p>
<p>Along with this update, it's announced that the first in-game event that was planned for Civilization VII will instead be postponed to a later update. This includes future events as well, with them all taking a backseat so that the developers can focus on prioritizing quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide.</p>
<p>After today's update, there will then be another major update taking place this month, with Update 1.1.1 of Civilization VII slated for March 25 (subject to change). This will add in the Quick Move functionality, as well as the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities and a new Natural Wonder, which is available to all players.</p>
<p>Looking even further into the future, the developers are planning on adding new map sizes for all platforms except Nintendo Switch, mod tools and Steam Workshop support, and further customizations that can be made to a player's game.</p>
<p>If you want the nitty-gritty of each change made in today's update to Civilization VII, or any future updates, you can find the information on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Civilization VII website</a>.</p>
