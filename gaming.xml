The 16GB model is only $10 less than the bundle version; the 32GB model is $5 less; and the 64GB edition is actually the same price. So why would you willingly give up the $60 Fabric Folio and $20 AC adapter?</p><p>You probably shouldn't <em>unless </em>you have a device that's eligible to trade in toward the new Scribe. The non-bundle version is eligible for an additional 20% discount when you trade in a device. Your old Kindle is the obvious choice, but Amazon also accepts other devices, including Fire tablets, Fire TV Sticks, and even some Apple products.</p><p>With a trade-in, you'll get the value of that device <em>and </em>an additional 20% discount on your new purchase. That's a substantial savings. Trade-in values vary considerably, but the extra 20% is worth $52 to $62--and that's automatic. Here are the new prices, not including your trade-in.</p><ul><li>16GB -- $208</li><li>32GB -- $224</li><li>64GB -- $248</li></ul><p>It doesn't matter if you trade in a Fire Stick worth $3 or the original Kindle Scribe 16GB model for $85. But it is worth noting that if you own the original 2022 Scribe and want to upgrade, that $85 figure is what Amazon offered me, effectively lowering the price of the 2024 model to $123.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F9NMHGFT,B0F9N9DCHZ,B0F9NDJ4R5,B0CZ9VFQ2P,B0CZ9TDDN6,B0CZ9T2C6B&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See all Kindle Scribe Prime Day Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4ksexRp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Browse Prime Day Kindle Book Sale</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Audible Premium Plus Deal - Get 3 Months Free</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Unlimited Deal - Get 3 Months Free</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds-Wireless-Charging-Case/dp/B085WTWYS4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Echo Buds with ANC</a> -- $45 (<del>$140</del>)</li></ul><p>If you take advantage of the Kindle Scribe deal and have never tried <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Unlimited</a></strong>, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kindle-unlimited-sign-up-deal-amazon-prime-day/1100-6524603/" data-ref-id="1100-6524603">get your first three months for free</a>, which grants access to a library of over 4 million books, comics, graphic novels, manga, and more.</p><hr><p>Some Kindle Unlimited titles also include audiobook versions that can be listened to on your Kindle.

<figure><a title="Helldivers 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/813674842bbb6/helldivers-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Arrowhead Game Studios, SIE</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Arrowhead Game Studios shell-shocked the games industry – announcing it would be bringing its PvE third-person shooter <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2">Helldivers 2</a> to the Xbox. Yes, the Sony-published game exclusive to PlayStation on consoles, is now making its way to Microsoft's hardware.</p>
<p>Given the timing of all this, there are now (<em>unsurprisingly</em>) some Helldivers calling for a Switch 2 port, with threads on <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1940824347587010622">Reddit and social media popping up</a> – asking the folks at Arrowhead to "let everyone in", in reference to Nintendo players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 has all the credentials to handle Helldivers, if Steam Deck can do it, the new Switch will do it without any problems"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it's the Switch 2's recent release that's given <em>some</em> fans hope as the game is now dropping on Xbox next month. As you might also expect, there are plenty of other opinions about the possibility of something like this happening – with many Helldivers ruling it out due to how demanding the online multiplayer title can be (especially in its more hectic moments).

<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment is behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_25">MLB The Show</a>, which is already available on other platforms, but it's also a sport-licensed game. Helldivers is obviously <em>different</em> in that respect with live service updates, and the community has played a huge role in sustaining the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>For now, Helldivers can expect reinforcements to arrive on Xbox this August. You can find out more about this particular version of the game on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/helldivers-2-is-officially-releasing-for-xbox-this-august">our sibling site Pure Xbox</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has rolled out new updates for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. The latest patches are fairly minor, primarily addressing a few issues related to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-zelda-notes-app-for-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild/1100-6532180/" data-ref-id="1100-6532180">Zelda Notes</a> service for the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of both games.</p><p>According to Nintendo's <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/25568/kw/breath%20of%20the%20wild" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, the new updates resolve a bug that can occur when attempting to use certain Daily Bonus perks. Specifically, Nintendo says it has "fixed an issue in which the player was unable to use the Daily Bonus effects 'Health Recovery' or 'Hearty Meal' if they had increased their hearts to the maximum number."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft layoffs of around 9,000 people</a> – which led to cascading cancellations of projects like <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, and an unannounced Zenimax MMO – Communications Workers of America, the union that represents thousands of games workers across Microsoft, has confirmed that some under its umbrella have been impacted (<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike in early 2024</a>, when they were entirely unaffected by a separate set of mass layoffs).</p><p>“We are deeply disappointed in Microsoft’s decision to lay off thousands more workers, including union-represented CWA members, at a time when the company is prospering,” president Claude Cummings Jr said in a statement <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-statement-layoffs-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on CWA’s website</a>. “We will be bargaining with the company over these layoffs, and CWA district vice presidents Mike Davis and Derrick Osobase will remain directly involved in ensuring that our members are supported and treated with dignity throughout this process.”</p><p>Workers within Zenimax’s QA union, who were granted anonymity on the basis that they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Microsoft provided the union no forewarning about the layoffs.</p><p>“Zenimax sent the union an email [yesterday], after they already started letting go/deactivating people in other departments,” one union member told Aftermath.</p><p>CWA and Microsoft initially boasted a mutually beneficial relationship while the latter was attempting to get its purchase of Activision Blizzard across the regulatory finish line. The organizations hashed out a legally binding union neutrality deal <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2022</a>, which CWA said at the time would “give employees a seat at the table and ensure that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard benefits the company’s workers and the broader video game labor market.” Multiple rounds of layoffs later, that relationship has soured, with CWA and represented workers issuing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-union-hits-out-at-heartless-microsoft-gaming-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasingly harsh critiques</a> of Microsoft over the years.</p><p>CWA-affiliated workers also <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Microsoft of dragging its feet</a> where Zenimax QA union contract bargaining was concerned, though the two sides <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally came to terms at the tail end of May</a> after nearly two years at the table. Now, only a month later, layoffs have led to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a project cancellation</a> at Zenimax Online Studios, the creator of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has its own multidisciplinary union</a>. Yesterday, Zenimax Online Studios president and <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> director Matt Firor also <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced he was leaving the company</a> after more than 18 years.</p><p>“Right now, we are living through a moment of profound corporate consolidation and disruption,” Cummings said in today’s statement. “In times like these, union organizing is not just a tool for protections in the workplace; it is essential to workers’ survival, and one of the strongest defenses we have against unchecked corporate power. This news will not slow the movement for a video game industry that works for those who make it what it is today.

                <p>A new Resident Evil game is in development, and it'll be putting a strategy twist on the franchise.

<p>Following the confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s developer earlier this week, it seems we now know about the team linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>As highlighted by GamesRadar+ it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party">Mario Party</a> team Nintendo Cube (in conjunction with NPD 4) – with the Japanese developer recently posting this information on its official website. The same developer has worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and more recently the "complete" version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/animal_crossing_pocket_camp_complete">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a>.</p>
<p>If you've also played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a>, you might have noticed how the avatars (<em>and generally relaxing vibe</em>) are somewhat similar, so it all checks out!</p><div><figure data-videoid="bZE9oIFPXWw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5bdf6fqgykst&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZE9oIFPXWw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, now you at least know who you were directly supporting when buying this paid game (which originally had some people calling for it to be a free "pack-in" title). This same developer has been working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> – arriving later this month on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You want your games to play the smoothest they possibly can — but sometimes, screen technology gets in the way. That’s why some of the latest TVs and handhelds feature <em>variable refresh rate</em> (VRR) screens that can compensate when your graphics can’t deliver a consistent 60 or 120 frames per second.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has a VRR screen — and originally, Nintendo advertised that the Switch 2 would also work with your VRR-capable TV. But Nintendo soon <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oliemack.bsky.social/post/3lmxv4nwjp22g">scrubbed mentions of docked VRR</a> from its website, and on May 16th, it apologized. “Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only,” the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">told <em>Nintendo Life</em></a><em>, </em>apologizing for “the incorrect information.”</p><p>But I’ve just confirmed that the official Nintendo Switch 2 dock <em>does</em> support VRR — by plugging the Steam Deck into it.</p><p>In fact, we found multiple rival handhelds can output 4K at 120Hz with both HDR and VRR if you plug them into the Nintendo Switch 2 dock. I saw the same with the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS, and an Asus ROG Ally X <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">with Bazzite</a>, each outputting to my Samsung S90C TV. We got the idea from Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1lnh0fe/psa_switch_2_dock_supports_vrr_and_hdr_on_steam/?share_id=Pge9JSi-B5Dxocskxn-Yu&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">where u/DynaMach</a> and others have reported VRR working this way.</p><p>It’s not particularly <em>practical</em> to play a PC handheld via Nintendo’s dock, because you’ll need a female-to-male USB-C extension cable and you’ll need to continually hold it against Nintendo’s spring-loaded platform to keep it from getting ejected — but I just so happened to have one of those cables lying around.</p><p>And before you ask, yes, I did actually test that 4K VRR actually works at up to 120 frames per second — I didn’t just trust SteamOS’s flag that it was supported. I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Nixola/VRRTest">the open-source VRRTest tool</a> and messed with various settings, just to check that intermediate framerates between 48fps and 60fps and 90fps all stayed smooth on my TV as the framerate fluctuates.</p><p>So if the Switch 2 supports VRR, and the dock supports VRR, why does Nintendo not offer VRR display output from the Nintendo Switch 2?</p><p>It would be a boon in many games, whether we’re talking about games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> that don’t run at 60fps on Switch to begin with, or even games that only occasionally dip below that threshold (say, 55fps) where that dip currently manifests as a big stutter in your gameplay.</p><p>Personally, I think it’s possible Nintendo just doesn’t think the Switch 2 is ready to put it on the big screen.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review"><em>Digital Foundry</em> found “clear problems”</a> even in the Switch 2’s handheld VRR mode, including judder in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s 40fps “performance” modes, as well as <em>Hitman: World of Assassination’s</em> unlocked-but-capped 60fps mode — although Nintendo’s own Welcome Tour showed proper VRR support.</p><p>“Clearly the feature is in there and working, because the Welcome Tour proves it, but the actual implementation in other games so far is disappointing,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Rich Leadbetter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uQ5CMfFc7c&amp;t=2332s">explained on the channel’s podcast</a>.</p><p>But if you’re looking for technical reasons why Nintendo might not pass along VRR to the official dock, Leadbetter tells me he hasn’t yet heard a good theory. He does believe, however, that Nintendo probably made an honest mistake when it wrote, then apologized for writing, that the Switch 2 would support VRR in TV mode. He doubts that Nintendo axed the feature at the last minute.</p><div><p>This is just the latest technological weirdness around the Switch 2’s launch, like we saw when testing the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">semi-locked-down USB-C video output</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">why the best webcams didn’t work</a>.</p></div><p>But as before, Nintendo is staying silent: it didn’t have a comment for our story.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/697937/nintendo-switch-2-vrr-steam-deck-rog-x-ally-120hz]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week sees the debut of Crunchyroll’s summer season of anime, and one of the streamer’s new lineup of shows has become the focal point of online discussion not for the content of its story, but for its subtitles, which appear to include a line explicitly mentioning ChatGPT.</p><p>On Tuesday, Bluesky user pixeldoesthings uploaded a screenshot of Cyangames’ and studio Gokumi’s VR video game-centric action anime, <em>Necronomicon and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>. In their screenshot, the lower third of the anime’s German subtitles read, “ChatGPT said:Wenn ich die Welt von hier an weiter genießen kann.” According to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anime News Network</em></a>, the dialogue line appears at the end of the premiere episode of the anime around its 19:12 timestamp.&nbsp;</p><p>“Beyond disappointed to find <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>'s subs on Crunchyroll are blatantly and openly ChatGPT,” pixeldoesthings wrote in the post. “This is not acceptable. How can we be expected to pay for a service that clearly doesn't care about the quality of its products?”</p><p>As <em>ANN </em>notes, as of July 2, the German subtitle line no longer includes “ChatGPT” in its subtitling; however, for many, the damage was already done. Pixeldoesit’s post has since been cross-posted from BlueSky to Twitter, leading to an outcry from anime fans wondering if the streamer was caught blatantly using ChatGPT, rather than hiring human subtitlers.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, a Crunchyroll spokesperson provided an official statement this morning saying, “We were made aware that AI-generated subtitles were employed by a third-party vendor, which is in violation of our agreement. We are investigating the matter and are working to rectify the error.”</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081180/crunchyroll-president-purini-anime-funimation-shutdown-sony-merger-decoder-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Verge</em></a> in February 2024, Crunchyroll President Rahul Purini mentioned that the company was experimenting with machine-learning technology to "improve and optimize [their] processes" for delivering subtitles in more languages worldwide at a faster rate compared to the original Japanese release date of seasonal anime. The following March, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24092569/crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-funimation-account-updates-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Polygon </em></a>asked whether Purini’s stance on AI had changed in the wake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/funimations-app-will-officially-sunset-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll’s merger with then-competitor Funimation</a>—a merger that led to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-president-responds-to-concerns-over-lost-digital-copies-due-to-funimation-merger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan outcry over losing digital anime content they once owned on Funimation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Purini reiterated to <em>Polygon </em>that the anime company wasn’t using AI in its subtitling, despite subscriber worries over his February 2024 statement, which had hinted at the possibility that the streamer <em>would </em>implement machine-generated subtitles.</p><p>“AI is new, we are curious to see what it can do, what it cannot do, to understand it better,” Purini told <em>Polygon</em>. “Quality is of paramount importance for us, and if we find out the technology is not to the level that it can create the best subtitles we want for our fans, then we will wait until the technology gets there. And if it never gets there, then it never gets there.”</p><p>When <em>Polygon </em>asked how and when Crunchyroll might implement AI-generated subtitling and closed captioning into the company’s localization workflow, Purini declined to comment on a timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>“We still don’t know if we can get them done,” Purini said. “It’s really, really early testing so far.”&nbsp;</p><p>The widespread outrage within the anime community over obvious ChatGPT-produced subtitles for a lesser-known show highlights a long-standing concern. Many worry that, like the <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-01-23/shogakukan-releases-novelous-light-novel-manga-app-using-ai-assisted-translation-in-u.s-canada/.220391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manga</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film</a>, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/ai-in-movies-tv-op-ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game industries</a>, anime may also be showing signs of increasingly relying on AI for faster production and higher output.</p><p>Anime fans’ collective outrage over <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>’s ChatGPT-generated subtitles shows they recognize the vital role of human translators and localizers. After all, it's these human beings’ expert skills and training that have contributed to Crunchyroll’s lofty position as the leading platform for anime fans, not AI. And it should stay that way.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-zenimax-activision-blizzard-cwa-union-statement"><h3>CWA ‘Deeply Disappointed’ In Microsoft, Plans To Bargain Over Layoffs</h3></a><p>"We are living through a moment of profound corporate consolidation and disruption"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kenny-omega-aew-wrestling-little-v"><h3>How Kenny Omega’s AEW Wrestling Theme Came To Life</h3></a><p>Ahead of AEW: All In Texas, Little V Mills shares how he came up with “Battle Cry” as Omega’s wrassling anthem

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has announced that they are sunsetting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a>, shutting down the game’s servers on 12th January 2026, after which the online-only title will no longer be playable.</p>
<p>In preparation of this, Anthem and premium currency have all been removed from sale.</p>


<p>This comes “After careful consideration” and gives roughly half a year’s notice of the shutdown. The BioWare Team sign off by saying “We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m surprised that EA kept the servers running this long, given how Anthem was one of the most ignominious flops of the past decade.</p>
<p>After a troubled development, Anthem launched on 22nd February 2019 to a generally poor reaction, struggling with performance, bugs, and generally failing to excite in the same way that rivals like Destiny 2 and The Division were managing at the time. The insider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/04/bioware-admits-and-pledges-to-address-workplace-issues-after-anthem-expose/">tales of the game’s troubled conception at BioWare</a> emerged immediately, the company retreating into its shell after announcing that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/anthems-roadmap-act-1-delayed/">the Act 1 roadmap had been seriously delayed</a>.</p>

<p>As the continued development of the game was handed over to BioWare Austin, it took half a years before the game’s first event, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/30/anthem-cataclysm-event-revealed-pts-live-next-week-everything-we-know/">Cataclysm</a>, was added, followed by smaller seasonal in-game events. It was clear that something dramatic was needed to revive the game’s fortunes and the hope was that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/10/bioware-reinvent-anthem-ps5-new-seasons-cheap-deal-game-offer-ps4-xb1/">Anthem NEXT</a> could be that, those plans shattered by the slower pace of development through the pandemic in 2020, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/24/anthem-next-cancelled-no-more-updates/">EA eventually pulled the plug in 2021</a> around the game’s second anniversary.</p>
<p>That effectively consigned Anthem to the history books, and it’s hard to believe that many people have been playing at all over the past five years. I’d have totally believed you if you told me that servers were already shut down in 2022 or ’23.</p>
<p>The silver lining is that, if you do want to play a game with some pretty great Iron Man style flying, you’ve still got the rest of this year to do so.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona5-the-phantom-x-review-in-progress.1235565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always been skeptical of Persona spin-offs. How can you twist such rich games into new shapes while maintaining the intricate details that make the series so beloved? Well, when it comes to the most recent addition to the family, Persona5: The Phantom X, the team at Perfect World appear to have done just that – or, at least, that’s how it seems on the surface. With beautifully animated cutscenes and a goosebump-inducing soundtrack, The Phantom X makes it clear early on that it isn’t keen to shake up the Persona formula. What it does do, however, is infuse that already excellent base with the all too familiar premium currencies of a mobile-focused gacha game. I have a more to play before my final review, but no matter how close it comes to recapturing the magic, there’s already a creeping sensation that this walk down memory lane is going to make way for endless grinding eventually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review"><u>Persona 5</u></a> spin-off, The Phantom X doesn’t centre around Joker and his crew – instead, you’ll be playing as a fresh protagonist, Nagisa Kamisiro (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/persona-5-the-phantom-x/P5X_Protagonist_Canon_Name_Explained"><u>though you can still pick your own name</u></a>), in an alternate timeline version of that story. A seemingly average student, Kamasiro’s life changes when an adorable owl called Lufel calls on them to fight back against the misery and hopelessness enveloping the world, and to turn the tables against the great despair that clouds the hearts of the public. Unable to refuse, Kamasiro learns to wield their inner Persona and travels to the shadow world to help clear out the collective unconscious, one monster at a time. If you’ve played Persona 5, you’ll quickly notice that The Phantom X is following its formula beat by beat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Persona5: The Phantom X Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To fight off the aforementioned evil, you’ll bounce between beautifully recreated Tokyo neighborhoods and the monster-filled Metaverse, seeking out misbehaving fiends and infiltrating their minds while learning to master the series’ trademark turn-based combat that centers around elemental weaknesses. And because Kamisiro is a teen, you’ll also have to balance studying, part-time work, and home life, too. With all of its obvious derivations, The Phantom X struggles to conjure fresh ideas or immediate excitement in the shadow of a nearly decade-old modus operandi, but it at least manages to successfully clone the Persona formula, and that will be enough for some. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, where the gameplay itself feels overfamiliar, the surrounding cast of characters provides enough mystery and warmth to keep things interesting. Alongside Kamisiro, you’ll meet the baseball-loving Motoha Arai, your husband-obsessed neighbour Kayo Tomiyama, and  adorable schoolmate Tomoko Noge, to name a few. With energetic voice acting to back up their emotive and often humorous dialogue, it’s clear there’s been an effort to give the NPCs a sense of self, or at least the ones I’ve met so far. It didn’t take me long to forge an emotional attachment to them. Morgana’s anthropomorphic owl counterpart, Lufel, is a particular standout, and I am thoroughly enjoying a running gag about their somewhat archaic vocabulary confusing the school-aged NPCs. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Phantom X follows Persona 5's formula beat by beat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll spend most of your days in Kamisiro’s shoes doing time-progressing tasks like studying for school in local cafes, working at the Konbini for cash, and buying groceries that you can use to cook back at your home. I’m still scratching the surface on how integral these side tasks feel in the scope of saving the world, though I’ve been enjoying making shopping lists and gawking at iconic Tokyo landmarks all the same. Particularly, wandering through the bustle of Shibuya Scramble and spotting its famous puppy mascot amongst the beaming electronic signs felt like a wonderful ode to a city I’ve come to love in both real life and games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from being a typical teen, much of your time in The Phantom X is spent in battle, and your combat expeditions launch from the Metaverse app located on Kamisiro’s phone. You can access these challenges anytime from the overworld, but you’ll need to use a naturally refreshing currency called Stamina to reap the rewards. Focusing on the mainline story missions will help keep you on track in terms of difficulty, though you can also explore a variety of combat challenges as you please to stockpile loot and earn experience, too. This is where the first hints of grinding come into focus but, mercifully, the combat in The Phantom X is very moreish and easy to sink time into. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Phantom X bases its combat system on Persona 5, meaning it's turn-based with engaging reactive elements. When you roll up on a baddie, you’ll cycle through your party one member at a time, choosing between melee attacks, ranged attacks, and special Persona abilities. Similar to Pokémon, the enemies you’ll face, as well as the Personas you deploy, all have elemental strengths and weaknesses (like fire or ice) that can be exploited for extra damage. It’s a tried-and-tested system with enough diversity in its moveset to keep battles fresh, and even if you are starting to tire of it, the imagination-stoking enemy designs pull a good amount of weight throughout. What makes Persona combat truly unique, though, is the series’ bold interface design and legendary battle themes. I promise, no matter how many times you’ve already heard Persona 5’s Last Surprise, it just doesn’t get old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, no amount of vocal flair from singer Lyn Inaizumi can make up for the sizable array of gacha systems and currencies you need to balance in The Phantom X. While there are characters and Personas you can unlock through the story, the quickest way to bolster your team is to engage in the lucky dip Contracts menu. In line with most other Gacha games on the market, you can earn the currencies you need to pull by grinding, or cut to the chase and pop in your credit card details to get an instant boost. I’m still only about 10 hours into my playthrough, and I’ve not hit any obvious roadblocks, but I can see them coming. At my current level, I have enough cash to buy health items, as well as a plethora of unique currencies to upgrade my Personas, weapons and more. Plus, when it comes to actually engaging with the gacha spins, I don’t feel like the boost they provide are hugely necessary to my success yet. Inevitably, this won’t last, though, and I can see cash-shaped hurdles on the horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the inclusion of premium currencies, perhaps my biggest issue with The Phantom X so far is that it feels more like an uncanny reflection of Persona 5, rather than a unique take on its established lore. Other spin-offs like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-tactica-review"><u>Persona 5 Tactica</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-strikers-review"><u>Persona 5 Strikers</u></a> feel like strong additions to the series that come at it from a completely different angle, whereas The Phantom X is more of a well-executed imitation. It’s not to say that I’m bored, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed both its combat and getting to know the characters so far. The first few chapters of its story are well-written, appropriately shocking, and do well to hook you into the world. But The Phantom X’s  “do-over” take on the story The Phantom Thieves just isn’t providing a new enough experience to warrant the amount of time (or possibly money) I’ll need to invest to see it through when Persona 5 and its predecessors are readily available and feel far more curated and engaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m mostly enjoying my time with Persona5: The Phantom X so far, there’s still so much to explore before delivering my final review, like investigating the depth of the upgrade systems and the long-term impact of premium currencies as you progress. As a fan of the series, it’s hard to look a gift horse in the mouth when it comes to fresh Persona 5-related content. But as of right now, I’m just unsure about how The Phantom X can deviate enough from the core material to compel me to invest in it long term – only time will tell. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite games set in Japan</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review]]></content:encoded>

Now, the trial is over and Francois and Hascoet have both been convicted alongside another former Ubisoft executive, former games director Guillaume Patrux.</p><p>All three men were sentenced to suspended prison terms for their roles in "enabling a culture of sexual and psychological harassment," as reported by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/french-court-convicts-ex-ubisoft-bosses-for-workplace-harassment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Courthouse News Service</a>. Francois was also convicted of attempted sexual assault and given a three-year suspended sentence. During the trial, it was reported that Francois sexually harassed female and male employees, including attempts to grope their genitals.</p><p>Hascoet was handed a shorter suspended sentence of 18-months, while Patrux was given a 12-month suspended sentence for personally bullying members of his team.

<p>After last month, we bet you thought July was cooling off a little, right? Well... a little<em>, but not much.</em></p>
<p>The Switch 2 has been here for a month now, and we're swimming in games old and new on the new platform. And look, we all know what's top banana for many of you this month, and a new Switch 2 Edition is also on the agenda, but there's 13 (ish... there's a couple of bundles here!) other fabulous looking games coming out on both hybrids.</p>
<p>Running through the best of the best for July is the lovely Felix, who's out enjoying the gorgeous summer sun <em>and</em> sharing some exciting games coming to Nintendo's consoles. What a duo, hey? Sun, fun, and video games... <em>ahhh</em>.</p>
<p>Make sure you check out the video up-top, but here's the 15 games we're most looking forward to this month:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-layoffs-signal-video-game-industry-brain-drain.1235514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The consequences of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox layoffs</a> are still trickling out, with news of canceled games and closed studios only the vaguest outline of the full effects. Among those caught in Microsoft’s latest bad decision are people with a combined over 60 years at the company, and even more years in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s just a handful that are known so far. Zenimax Online Studios president and <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> director Matt Firor <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-elder-scrolls-online-director-matt-firor-who-helped-launch-zenimax-online-studios-in-2007-is-leaving-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced he was leaving the company</a> after “more than 18 years.” Firor has been at Zenimax Online since its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-media-announces-establishment-of-online-gaming-division-zenimax-online-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founding in 2007</a>, long before it fell into Microsoft’s clutches in 2021. Before Zenimax, he was one of the founders of Mythic Entertainment and has <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/83290/matt-firor/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game credits</a> going back to the 90s.</p><p>Turn 10 design director Jon Knoles announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346304368750510084/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> that he’d been caught in the layoffs, after 15 years at Xbox working on Forza games. Knoles has been in game development since <a href="https://x.com/jonk1969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1989</a>, and told <a href="https://www.jedinews.com/interviews/articles/shadows-at-25-jon-knoles-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jedi News</a> that “I landed my first game development job at Taito Software Inc., working on [1991’s] <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> for the 8-bit Nintendo system.” Knoles went on to work on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/1140/jon-knoles/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>so many</em></a> Star Wars games, spending <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonknoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 15 years</a> at LucasArts, among other studios.</p><p>At Rare, which saw its in-development game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Everwild</em></a> canceled yesterday, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a> reports that Gregg Mayles is leaving the studio after 35 years. Mayles was working on <em>Everwild</em>, but his career at Rare started with <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/51913/gregg-mayles/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> like <em>Donkey Kong Country, Battletoads, </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. He served as creative director on <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, where a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2kU27giiEs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">song in the game’s soundtrack</a> is named after him. VGC also reports that executive producer Louise O’Connor will be leaving the studio; O’Connor, who was also working on <em>Everwild</em>, has been with Rare <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louridge/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since 1999</a>.</p><p>The experience and talent Microsoft has just discarded is staggering, and these are only some of the people we know about so far. When Phil Spencer writes in his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff justification</a> that “we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted,” the people he’s speaking of weren’t just foundational to Microsoft, but to some of gaming’s earliest characters, studios, and systems. But in order for Xbox to “protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business,” those people now have to be pushed out from the industry they helped create.&nbsp;</p><p>From a hard-hearted business perspective, it makes sense to lose experienced people; they cost a lot of money! They cost a lot of money because they have a lot of experience, experience that doesn’t just contribute to the projects they’re on, but to their less experienced colleagues. This helps those colleagues, in turn, become the kind of experienced game developers Microsoft is willing to be rid of to make the line go up. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/tech/microsoft-layoffs-9000-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader cuts</a> have focused on axing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-layoffs-d1f2de54ebad6f099deac8fbd3375835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managers</a> in a claim toward “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-begins-latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-with-cuts-at-king-and-zenimax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">efficiency</a>,” but how efficient is it to brain drain your company?</p><p>These days, early-career and experienced game developers alike can’t keep their jobs, and up-and-coming developers can’t enter the industry if there’s no jobs available. Game development isn’t alone in this; we’re seeing similar things happen in <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-shield-mini-room-television" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalism</a>, among other fields. What happens to these industries when basically no one can work in them? How does Microsoft, or any company, plan to make the games it claims its layoffs are in service of when <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no one is left to make them</a>? Where do laid-off people go, and what happens when newcomers are competing for a handful of jobs against people with <em>decades</em> of experience? This whole thing sucks.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-zenimax-activision-blizzard-cwa-union-statement"><h3>CWA ‘Deeply Disappointed’ In Microsoft, Plans To Bargain Over Layoffs</h3></a><p>"We are living through a moment of profound corporate consolidation and disruption"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kenny-omega-aew-wrestling-little-v"><h3>How Kenny Omega’s AEW Wrestling Theme Came To Life</h3></a><p>Ahead of AEW: All In Texas, Little V Mills shares how he came up with “Battle Cry” as Omega’s wrassling anthem

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>BioWare has announced plans to sunset online support for Anthem. On January 12, 2026, the cooperative sci-fi shooter’s servers will be shut down, rendering the online-only title completely unplayable.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">blog post</a>, BioWare states players can no longer purchase Anthem or its premium in-game currency as of today, but they can spend their remaining balance until the game goes offline. Anthem will also be removed from EA Play on August 15. However, those who have already purchased Anthem can still download and play the game until the January 12 shutdown.</p><p>“We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that,” BioWare says in the blog post.</p><p>BioWare also states that it has not laid off any staff as a result of the sunsetting process.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aOGDso1yvM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aOGDso1yvM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This news marks the end of a long and tumultuous road for the maligned shooter. First revealed in promising fashion during E3 2017, Anthem centered on players, called Freelancers, suiting up in powerful mech suits called Javelins to defend humanity on a hostile alien world. Up to three players teamed up to tackle missions in an online-only campaign, while improving their Javelin via RPG-style progression. Anthem launched in a deeply flawed state in February 2019, resulting in a tepid reception from critics and players, including a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/anthem/grinding-gears">7 out of 10</a> from <em>Game Informer</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Chief complaints centered on the game's thin content and buggy gameplay, with many players expressing the game felt unfinished. Anthem's troubled development would later be revealed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">reports</a>, such as how it largely came together during the year before release despite being in formal development since 2012. BioWare bolstered the game with post-launch updates, and in October 2020, it announced a massive overhaul called <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/10/29/anthem-20-update-revealed-possible-no-mans-sky-esque-comeback-if-pulled-off-correctly">Anthem 2.0,</a> designed to dramatically improve the experience. However, this update was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/24/anthem-20-canceled-by-bioware">canceled</a> in February 2021 as BioWare shifted resources towards the development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/mass-effect-lives-on-with-bioware-tease-of-liaras-return">next Mass Effect</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Have you kept up with Anthem over the years, or do you plan to dive back in before the servers are shut down? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/anthems-servers-are-shutting-down-in-january-rendering-it-completely-unplayable]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-xbox-invites-developers-to-roundtable-on-ai-tools-for-game-development-while-laying-off-thousands.1235505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft laid off 9,000 employees</a> across the entire company yesterday, with an unknown number of those cuts impacting the Xbox and gaming division. Part of these cuts are<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/"> reportedly directly related to Microsoft's push into AI</a>, and some of those impacted by the cuts are speaking out about how <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/">Microsoft is doing its "<em>damndest</em>"</a> to replace people with AI as fast as it can. </p>



<p>You might think, then, that at least for a day, possibly even a few days, Microsoft would post-pone any more pushing of its AI technology into the faces of developers, publicly or privately. Not the case, it would seem, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">Kotaku</a> spotted that Necrosoft Games director, Brandon Sheffield, shared the beginnings of an email he received from Microsoft and ID@Xbox, inviting him to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 where Microsoft will be talking up using "<em>AI in our tools and processes to make the game development and publishing experience more efficient</em>."</p>







<p>Below Sheffield's post, other developers shared their response to getting the same invitation, with Toronto-based developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social/post/3lt36vjygks2t">Benjamin Rivers saying</a> "<em>just get wrecked, mates</em>." Sheffield agreed, "<em>they really should</em>."</p>



<p>While reports of the total layoffs at Microsoft have the number at 9,000, the exact amount of people impacted in the gaming division remains unclear at this time of writing. Meanwhile, these layoffs have left the talented workers and developers out of a job due to poor decisions made by a c-suite of executives who, for some reason still have their jobs, despite the fact that thousands of layoffs is a clear sign they messed up along the way, and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/">pushed out veteran developers</a> who contain a wealth of knowledge that the AI tools Microsoft is pushing cannot hope to replace.</p>



<p>This is just a shot in the dark, but it seems like decisions that don't lead to wasting and mismanaging talent that has been in this industry for years would be the more efficient route towards successful game development, instead of AI tools that have, so far, proven capable costing a lot of money.</p>

The game will be removed from EA Play on August 15, 2025, but will still be available for download if it's already in your library until it officially shuts down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem launched in February of 2019 to lukewarm reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">including our own 6.5/10</a> which criticized the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and a mismatched story. The game had sold 5 million copies as of December of 2023, which fell short of EA's target of 6 million copies in the first few months. Though EA continued to update and improve Anthem in the months that followed its launch, in February of 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">EA ceased active development on the game</a>. The following month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-game-director-jonathan-warner-departs-bioware-after-nearly-10-years">its game director departed the company</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an FAQ, EA stated that no layoffs occurred at the company as the result of Anthem's sunset. This will come as a relief, given that EA has undergone a number of massive staffing cuts in the last few years that have left staff reeling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, EA shut down Cliffhanger Games and canceled its in-development Black Panther game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">laying off an unknown number of individuals in the process</a>. That same month, it implemented <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">mandatory return-to-office for all workers.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just the month before, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off roughly 300 people</a>, and still earlier this year EA restructured Anthem developer BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving some developers to other projects</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off others</a>. That was all just in 2025. Last year, EA underwent a massive restructuring that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 workers</a> laid off company-wide, and the year before that in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">50 individuals were laid off at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number of others were cut at Codemasters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for BioWare, it's currently fully focused on Mass Effect 5 after the sales failure of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
