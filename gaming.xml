              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690"><span>Novelty popcorn buckets</span></a><span> are a real hit-or-miss trend, with many being so clumsily aggressive as pure marketing for whatever film they’re themed around that the actual utility for holding the salty, buttery goodness of your favorite theater’s popcorn falls by the wayside. But now and then, something interesting pops up and you see why movie studios are investing in these buckets of popcorn. </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is heading to theaters this weekend, and the magic-based crime drama has one of the better popcorn buckets I’ve seen lately, both because it’s actually practical as a popcorn bucket, and because it manages to capture the spirit of the movie without just being a replica of a character or item in the film.</span></p>

 <p><span>At a glance, the bucket looks like a pretty standard box with the </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>poster on the sides. However, it also uses an optical illusion to make it look as if the popcorn disappears, like it would in a magic trick. There’s a hidden compartment that helps sell the trick, and if you’re looking at it from the right angle, it does truly look like the kind of illusion you’d see in a magician’s stage show.</span></p>   <p><span>Like most optical illusions, if you know the secret, your eyes will probably adapt and see the truth, but it is still a pretty cool popcorn bucket that doesn’t just feel like an elaborate collectible statue with a popcorn-shaped hole on the side. The next question is: Is it worth going to see </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</span></i><span> to get it? Eh. Despite the series’ stacked cast and neat premise of magic-based heists, they’ve never really gotten much critical acclaim. </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is sitting at a series high on review aggregate site </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_2025"><i><span>Rotten Tomatoes</span></i></a><span> with a 60 percent approval rating. So I guess they’re getting better? </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-publisher-defends-generative-ai-and-says-you-should-assume-everyone%E2%80%99s-using-it.1351030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is a great game</a> with a complicated legacy thanks to its use of generative AI to voice NPCs. It’s the same strategy Embark Studios used with The Finals, and the CEO of publisher Nexon now says fans should get used to it.</p> <p>“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” Junghun Lee told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><em>Game*Spark</em></a>, according to a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translation by Automaton</a>. “But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.”</p>

 <p>He believes generative AI will increase the capabilities of game studios across the board, thus increasing the “average” quality. ” AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations,” Lee said.</p>

 <p>His comments come after fellow South Korea game publisher Krafton revealed an “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">AI first</a>” plan to invest roughly $70 million in GPU clusters and related resources to build out an infrastructure for deploying agentic AI across the company. Krafton happens to own the makers of <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p>

 <p>But the deployment of AI in games remains controversial and confusing, as proved by Nexon’s own <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <h2>No one agrees on what counts as generative AI</h2> <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em>&nbsp;in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with&nbsp;<em>PCGamesN</em></a>. But in addition to using machine learning during the development process, the hit Steam extraction shooter also uses text-to-speech models to voice all of the NPC barks for every random item and situation.</p>

 <p>“[Text-to-speech] allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it’s needed, or where there’s tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work,” Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer last month. “So it’s a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn’t use any generative AI.”</p>

 <p>Others disagree, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><em>Eurogamer</em>‘s own review</a> which became a flash point on social media this week after it critiqued Arc Raiders use of AI voices. “[Machine learning] is an interesting technology, and the effects it produces during matches are undeniably convincing,” wrote Rick Lane. “The same cannot be said about Embark’s generated voice lines, which are aggressively mediocre and a stain on the experience.”</p> <p>There are also those who take issue with Nexon’s CEO’s assumption everyone must be racing to embrace generative AI more generally. “Hello, not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3m5fpw7lp7s2d">wrote</a> indie team <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong/">Necrosoft Games</a>. “<em>Demonschool</em> is 100% human made.”</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Drift 36 monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free cash and other rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drift 36 is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-grow-a-garden-film-adaptation-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-octane drifting and car racing circuit. Players are required to buy their first car upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to get the best automobiles available. With Roblox versions of highly sought-after vehicular brands like Porsche, Lamborghini and Koenigsegg on offer, car enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Drift 36.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having been released in the early months of 2025, Drift 36 has gradually gained traction over the course of the year and now boasts a fairly dedicated player base. Although simply participating in the various events the game offers is enough for players to keep upgrading their cars, using redeem codes to get some extra cash is never a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It is understood that Sony and Microsoft are working on new console platforms--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">PS6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next Xbox</a>--but when might they be released? According to Piers Harding-Rolls, the research director for games at Ampere Analysis, these new consoles could launch later than expected due to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> delay. This could happen, but it's not what Ampere expects.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that the delay of GTA 6 will have a "significant impact on console sales dynamics in 2026." This is because, with GTA 6 now coming in November 2026 instead of May 2026, console sales will be "even more back-loaded" than normal. How does the GTA 6 delay impact the next-generation console release dates? Harding-Rolls said his company is modeling the new systems to launch in late 2027, but that could change if the platform-holders want to squeeze more juice out of GTA 6.</p><p>"Might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the GTA 6 wave and waiting until 2028? The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the GTA franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies," he explained.</p><p>Harding-Rolls went on to say that GTA 6 is going to be "such an important driver of hardware sales," and not just when the game comes out, but for multiple years to follow. "Sony and Microsoft will have wanted a much earlier release than late 2026 so they could generate momentum earlier in the cycle," he said.</p><p>One of the reasons that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">GTA 5 sold so well</a> was because the game launched later in the PS3 and Xbox 360 lifecycles, coming multiple years after those consoles arrived. This meant that the install base of those machines was big at the time, and then Rockstar re-released GTA 5 for PS4 and Xbox One when those consoles came out in 2014. Then Rockstar put the game on PC in 2015 and then brought it to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2022.</p><h2><strong>What do we know about the PS6 and next Xbox?</strong></h2><p>Both Sony and Microsoft have confirmed that they are working on new consoles, but neither has been officially announced. Sony, for its part, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/" data-ref-id="1100-6535332">showed off some new experimental technology that could power its next console.</a> Microsoft, meanwhile, announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">partnership with AMD earlier this year</a> for future platforms. Rumors have swirled recently that Microsoft could quit the console business, but the company says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-xbox-consoles-not-canceled-microsoft-says/1100-6535237/" data-ref-id="1100-6535237">that's not true.</a></p><p>For now, GTA 6 is confirmed only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but if Rockstar follows a similar playbook to GTA 5, fans can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-fans-waiting-for-the-possible-pc-edition-now-have-to-wait-even-longer/1100-6536055/" data-ref-id="1100-6536055">expect it to come to PC later</a> and possibly new consoles.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders’ latest update brings the Duo Matchmaking table along with adjusted cosmetic prices and a free Raider Deck. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ latest extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has blown the competition out of the water, with the game hitting a concurrent peak of over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">700,000 players across all platforms</a>. As the game continues to break records, the developers have released a new update that adds a much-requested feature to the title, along with some additional changes. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-duo-matchmaking-was-being-silently-tested-since-the-beginning-of-this-week">ARC Raiders Duo Matchmaking Was Being Silently Tested Since the Beginning of this Week</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, ARC Raiders’ duo prioritised matchmaking has been silently tested since earlier this week. The developers first prioritise solo and squads to play separately. Post that, duos are prioritised to play with other duos, and the same applies to trios. The developers have also cautioned players that “this is not a 100% guaranteed system”, which means that they “may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.” </p>



<p>Along with the duo matchmaking for ARC Raiders, the developers are also making adjustments to store cosmetic prices based on feedback. They have reviewed the prices and “made adjustments to lower prices where applicable”. The new prices will be reflected from Thursday, November 13, at 10:30 CET. Moreover, Raiders who have already purchased at the old pricing will receive compensation for the difference, and their Raider Tokens will be refunded to their account within the coming week. </p>



<p>Lastly, one free Raider Deck is available to all players, and in the future, both free and premium decks will be offered. Players should note that gameplay items will be reserved for free decks as they help new raiders along the way and can be unlocked through progressions. Moreover, there will be no pay-to-win items in premium decks, and they will be based on cosmetics and convenience. </p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has defended ARC Raiders’ AI voices by saying ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every game company</a>‘ does it. Additionally, this game is the perfect extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-perfect-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for gamers new to the genre</a>.

                <p>Capcom has announced a new collaboration with KFC in Japan, themed around Monster Hunter Wilds. Starting on November 19, KFC branches will sell two limited-edition meals with unique packaging and codes for in-game items redeemable in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>The packaging shows off art of a Felyne partner that accompanies players in Monster Hunter Wilds (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-is-teaming-up-with-kfc-in-japan-for-exclusive-in-game-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), with the little critter cosplaying as KFC icon Colonel Sanders--complete with a trendy outfit and facial hair. The Feast Set comes with codes for a Luxury Ingredient Set of campfire cooking ingredients and the KFC Colonel Sanders Felyne charm, while the Spice Up Set includes a Hunting Item Set of consumable items and a KFC Barrel Felyne Charm. Upgrading a meal from standard to large will also get a themed sticker set.</p><p>Four KFC stores will also be decorated to make customers feel like they've entered the world of Monster Hunter, and the promotion will conclude on December 16. This isn't the first time that KFC has partnered up with a well-known video game, as back in 2021, there was a crossover with Genshin Impact in China. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-kfc-real-life-crossover-event-canceled-due-to-covid-concerns/1100-6488787/">That collaboration was unfortunately cut short</a> over COVID-19 protocol violations.</p><p>Capcom has also teamed up with McDonald's Japan last month to release a line of Street Fighter-themed burgers alongside free ketchup-and-mustard-inspired costumes for the game's roster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TkDxFIsI-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TkDxFIsI-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Wilds sales have continued to decline since launch, with Capcom reporting that it only sold 160,000 units of the game over its last financial quarter that ended on September 30, 2025. This is a major dip from the previous quarter that saw 477,000 sales of Monster Hunter Wilds, and Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto suggested that the high price of the PS5--the "main platform" for Monster Hunter Wilds players in Japan--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">was hurting sales of the game</a> in that region.</p>

<p>In Japan, at least</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Folks will no doubt be aware of Kazutoshi Iida from the cult-classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> for 64DD and GameCube, but now two of the creator's earlier titles are heading to the Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_tail_of_the_sun">Tail of the Sun</a> (1996) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_aquanauts_holiday">Aquanaut's Holiday</a> (1995) both launched for the PS1 with western publication from Sony itself. Now, Artdink is reviving both titles as part of its ARTDINK GAME LOG preservation project. Tail of the Sun will launch in Japan on <strong>16th December 2025</strong>, while Aquanaut's Holiday will follow in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARTDINK GAME LOG is a project to port and re-release game titles previously developed by ARTDINK onto modern gaming hardware.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"It serves as a record (log) of ARTDINK's game development journey. By reviving past masterpieces using current technology and platforms, it delivers nostalgia and rediscovery to longtime fans, while offering an unprecedented experience to new players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're unaware of what these titles entail, Tail of the Sun is an open-world game of sorts in which you play as a caveman with an aim to reach the sun by stacking 'ivory' from mammoths tusks. Meanwhile, Aquanaut's Holiday is an underwater simulator set in the first-person perspective in which you explore the ocean, find treasure, and interact with deep-sea creatures.</p>
<p>No release has been confirmed for western audiences at this time, but we wouldn't be surprised to see both games at some point in the future.</p>

			<p>Throughout 2025, rumors of Valve's upcoming projects have swirled with increasing intensity. We covered rumors that mentioned a possible <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Steam Console project</a> based on AMD's new RDNA 4 architecture, though the most persistent rumors were those focused on <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deckard</a>, the codename for Valve's new Virtual Reality headset, successor to the Index.</p>



<p>A couple of days ago, Bradley Lynch, a reliable leaker of the company's projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-may-announce-steam-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that we would get an announcement this week not only on Deckard (whose final name appears to be Steam Frame) but also on a new Steam controller. The Steam Frame is expected to feature the following specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</li>



<li>Display: 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</li>



<li>Features: SLAM tracking, eye tracking</li>
</ul>



<p>As for the controller, it will reportedly feature a 'capsense' feature to detect how far the user's fingers are from the gamepad's handles. </p>



<p>The announcements might land in a few hours. YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://x.com/mooreslawisdead/status/1988432610951852284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that Valve fans should prepare for the reveal to drop at around 19 UTC. But gamers are not-so-secretly hoping to learn about more than just new hardware. </p>



<p>Other rumors had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Valve was also hard at work on a new Half-Life project. Another leaker, Kurakasis, has <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1988309847046340713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gaben, do it 😈</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 is arguably a mythological figure in the games industry at this point. It's been twenty-one years since Half-Life 2, and although Half-Life Alyx was released in 2020 alongside the Valve Index VR headset, gamers would like a proper sequel to be available as a non-VR exclusive game.</p>



<p>Another leaker, Shpeshal Nick, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1988221134622630153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>If what I was just DMd is actually true (big if), next week GTA 6 could actually have its thunder stolen on the hype scale</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 could certainly steal a bit of attention away from GTA VI, at least for hardcore gamers (certainly not for the mainstream). It doesn't perfectly align with the other teasers, which all indicate an announcement coming later today. Then again, his sources might have been incorrect regarding the timeline. </p>



<p>Anyway, we should learn more about what's coming from Valve very soon. Sit tight.</p>

              <p>The LEGO Star Wars line has been the crown jewel of the brick builder’s empire for decades and good discounts on these sets are rare. That’s what makes this current deal so good: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary Edition down from $84 to $67</a>&nbsp;which is an all-time low for a set that boasts an impressive<strong> 4.9 out of 5-star rating</strong> from over 1,900 reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Stunning LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is not your typical LEGO build that gets assembled once and then tossed into a closet: The <strong>921-piece recreation of the Millennium Falcon</strong> captures the ship as it appeared in <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>, complete with authentic details that will make any fan smile. The cockpit sits exactly where it should, the iconic satellite dish perches on top-the round one, naturally and the quad laser cannons are positioned to defend against Imperial TIE fighters.</p>
<p>The base also includes a <strong>nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary commemorative brick</strong>, and celebrates a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars collaboration. Angled dynamically, the stand sets the ship in motion even when it’s just sitting on your shelf or desk. This thoughtful design transforms the model from a simple toy into legitimate home décor that sparks conversations. Measuring <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide,</strong> the completed build claims enough presence to anchor a bookshelf or entertainment center without overwhelming the space.</p>



<p>The building experience itself has that meditative quality LEGO has nailed with its adult-oriented sets. <strong>Each of the 921 pieces</strong> clicks into place with satisfying precision, while the instruction manual walks you through a logical construction sequence that builds excitement as the recognizable shape emerges. You’ll spend several hours immersed in this project, which is exactly the point for those seeking a creative outlet after a long day.</p>
<p>Timing makes this discount appealing as a gift option: For yourself or someone who considers Star Wars a lifestyle rather than a movie franchise, this set delivers on real value at this price point.&nbsp;At this historic low price, the barrier to entry for owning a piece of LEGO Star Wars history has never been lower.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh duo of characters have arrived in Marvel Rivals, with Gambit the first to join the fray at the start of Season 5, and we’ve got all the details on who the voice actor is.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals kicks off on November 14, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue joining as playable characters</a> this season, and the trend of boasting an impressive voice cast in the game continues.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all the details on who the voice actor of Gambit is in Marvel Rivals, or are wondering where you recognize the voice from, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-voicing-gambit-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Voicing Gambit in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Familiar sound. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The voice actor for Gambit in Marvel Rivals is AJ Locascio, a familiar name for fans of the X-Men character.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio also voices Gambit in X-Men ’97 on Disney+, which continues the story set out in the animated series from the 1990s. However, he was not the voice actor for Gambit in the original series; that role was performed by Chris Potter.</p>



<p>Though X-Men ’97 was the first time Locascio filled the role of Remy LeBeau, he more than made it his own with a stellar performance of the fan-favorite character.</p>



<p>That made him a natural choice to fit the role of Gambit in Marvel Rivals and joins a host of other names who have portrayed a character elsewhere before reviving the role in Marvel Rivals, alongside the likes of Yuri Lewanthal, Laura Bailey, Nolan North, and Troy Baker.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-roles-does-aj-locascio-have">What Other Roles Does AJ Locascio Have?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Locascio boasts a host of recognizable roles throughout his career, including the role of Marty McFly in Back to The Future: The Game, and Skjolder in God of War Ragnarok.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio’s career has also seen him play the role of Owen Grady in the Jurassic World: Evolution franchise, Han Solo in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and Jorund in Horizon Forbidden West.</p>



<p>He has also featured in other LEGO Star Wars animated titles, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers, Doom Eternal, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Dawn of the Croods.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> publisher Nexon has defended the game's use of generative AI, suggesting players should "assume that every game company is now using AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders, like developer Embark's 2023 shooter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-finals"><u>The Finals</u></a>, declares it uses AI in development, stating on its Steam store page: "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark expanded on this with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PCGamesN</u></a> recently, saying Arc Raiders "in no way uses generative AI whatsoever" and stressed that it instead used "something called machine learning, or reinforcement learning, and that's to do with the locomotion for our larger drones with multiple legs, but there's no generative content whatsoever." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in the same interview, design director Virgil Watkins added that with regards to its controversial text-to-speech system, it "hire[d] and contract[ed] voice actors for it — it's part of their contract that we use [AI] for this purpose, and that allows us to do things like our ping system, where it's capable of saying every single item name, every single location name, and compass directions. That's how we can get that without needing to have someone come in every time we create a new item for the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a fresh interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>), Junghun Lee, CEO of Arc Raiders' publisher Nexon, not only championed AI for improving "efficiency in both game production and live service operations," but also stated: "I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI," Lee said. "But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly feels as though Lee's comments ring true. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI</u></a>." Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conversely, Nintendo has bucked the trend, with Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto previously stressing that the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction"><u>would rather go in a “different direction” than the rest of the video game industry</u></a> when it comes to AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, its use of AI clearly hasn't held Arc Raiders back. It's now sold over 4 million copies worldwide less than two weeks since its release date, cementing its commercial success. Nexon also revealed that the extraction shooter had reached <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms"><u>a huge concurrent count of 700,000 players across all platforms</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"ARC Raiders raises the bar for extraction shooters pretty much across the board, with an incredibly gripping progression grind, tense fights against NPCs and other players that make for memorable matches, and loot that feels completely worth all the work and stress it takes to obtain it," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>IGN's Arc Raiders review</u></a>, which returned an 'Amazing' 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that it manages to also run well and look amazing all the while is just downright impressive, even if a few bugs here and there lead to the rare rage quit. For years I’d been wondering when someone would take the awesome promise of this genre to the next level, and ARC Raiders is without question what I’ve been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this has tempted you into jumping into Arc Raiders, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Best_ARC_Raiders_Settings"><u>best settings</u></a>, find out what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Skill_Tree_and_Best_Abilities"><u>skills we recommend unlocking</u></a> first, and see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/How_to_Deliver_Field_Depot_Crates"><u>how to earn loot by delivering field depot crates</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>Plus an increase for new-hires</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ba04dbd7d6d21"><a title="Sonic Mania" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba04dbd7d6d21/sonic-mania.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html">has announced</a> that it is raising the salary for its full-time staff along with increasing the starting salary for new-hires over in Japan (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Starting from 1st April 2026, the base salary for full-time employees will raise by an average of around 10%. Sega is introducing a more flexible pay structure while also converting annual bonuses into base pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the starting salary for new university graduates will see a similar 10% increase from 300,000 to 330,000 yen (approx $2,140).</p>
<p>In the press release (via machine translation), Sega said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[SEGA] will revise the salary levels of full-time employees at its Japanese subsidiary and raise the starting salary for new employees, with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices, and of recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega had already increased its employees' base salaries back in 2023 from 222,000 to 300,000 yen, so this latest news will no doubt be very welcome to workers over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-hit-by-mass-layoffs-as-part-of-global-restructuring">Square Enix recently announced widespread restructuring of its international workforce</a>, leading to layoffs across the UK, Europe, and the US. The progress report provided notes that the changes will lead to a saving of around around 3 billion yen, or roughly $19.6 million.</p>

"The player's eyebrows no longer disappear when using the inventory screen or idle camera," was the first note which caught my eye, followed by: "The player's eyebrow color will now be properly saved and applied to their in-game characters after character creation. Note: this unfortunately will not retroactively fix incorrect eyebrow color for existing characters."</p>
<p>Tragedy. Pour one out for all the space adventurers who're stuck explaining why the brows don't match their blonde, brown, or black barnet until the end of time. The hair-raising fixes don't end there. Obsidian have "made adjustments to side burn facial hair so that it no longer disappears at certain angles". Great relief for those roleplaying as American civil war generals or Victorian businessmen.</p>
<p>Getting serious for a moment before I shout out a bunch more wacky ones, Obsidian have fixed a couple of issues which could prevent saving and generally "increased Companion survivability", meaning that they should be more effective especially on harder difficulties and if your leadership skill's high. A number of crashes and scenarios that could see NPCs get stuck have had failsafes put in, while characters should "no longer unexpectedly take explosive damage through walls or objects". Companions should now properly follow you through vents and not get stuck wanting to talk to you when they've got nothing new to say. The studio have also nixed some references to cut content which were causing errors.</p>
<p>Right, more silliness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the Order of the Ascendants members were found to be having conversations with each other at very long distances on Cloister, this wasn't part of the grand equation and has been addressed</li>
<li>Preventing your VALERIE unit from 'beep bop booping' into Ladders if you have climbed it</li>
<li>Player arm doesn't freak out anymore after sliding into a forced cinematic or conversation</li>
<li>Marisol is no longer able to teleport to the rooftop of Scientician's Surplus and enter a problematic state</li>
<li>Characters will no longer make noises before they have been spawned into an encounter</li>
<li>Player can no longer sprint while being mentally refreshed</li>
<li>Glued shoulder pads back onto our 2-handed handgun users so they no longer fly</li>
</ul>

            <p>
A mouse cannot live on adorable visual aesthetics alone, but Winter Burrow is definitely handsome enough to get me through to lunchtime. In this just-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> from Danish developers Pine Creek Games, you play a rodent who has returned from the Rodent Big City to fix up their old treestump home.</p>
<p>It's something of a tragedy: your parents died in Rodent Big City, after working themselves to toothpicks, and your aunt has now gone missing. But the hand-illustrated 2D art style immediately lifts the mood. Look at your cutaway living room, with its cheerfully blazing fireplace! Look at those creamy hummocks of snow! Look at your frosty carcass being devoured by a spider! 
</p>
<p>
I feel like the winningly tatty Hundred Acre ambience might be at odds with the survival game premise, past a certain point, but the developers do note that Winter Burrow is based on "a dream of being able to play a survival game that was more forgiving than the genre usually is, but where there was still challenge and depth." They also observe that "the setting is inspired by books like 'The Wind in the Willows', the comic 'Mouse Guard' and the animated TV-series 'Over the Garden Wall'."</p>
<p>Personally, my mind flew to the Deptford Mice novels of Robin Jarvis, and especially The Crystal Prison, in which mice battle spectres in a cornfield. Those books are pretty grisly but they at least don't have any mouse-eating spiders, that I can remember. Also, there's a setting for turning the spiders off in Winter Burrow.
</p><p>
I've had a quick play of the demo, and it seems to hang together well enough as a survival game. The thrill of it right now is mostly unlocking rustic art assets, but it seems sturdily made for a survive 'em up, with a digestible UI and simple controls.</p>
<p>There are some congenial flourishes that bring warmth to the familiar business of stuffing sticks and stones into item recipes - for example, you'll knit new clothes in your plump and patchy armchair, rather than hammering out new socks and jerkins in a forge, as is often the case in less sentimental and internally consistent survival games. You can also make friends with neighbours while searching for your lost aunt, and there's talk of baking pies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">Read more on Steam</a>. If you prefer your mice to be mildly rotten and capable of hacking badgers to death, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-souls-meets-ocarina-of-time-in-mouseward-a-back-to-basics-soulslike-collectathon-with-sweet-n64-visuals">Mouseward</a> instead.

            <p>The term 'extraction shooter' is being used more and more as games like Escape from Tarkov and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> command huge audiences. It is the popular genre of the moment. But the label is deeply flawed, according to former Bungie product manager Chris Sides, who worked on extraction shooter Marathon. Personally, he hates the term.</p>
<p>"The genre name is so bad," Sides told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqwje5N5ArA">the Shooter Monthly Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/">The Game Post</a>). "I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name?' because 'extraction shooter' is so dumb. It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziFMFFkMJ2Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>What about 'battle royale', the host of the podcast quickly countered. "Battle royale is not a mechanic," Sides said, "it's a mode. Extraction is the mechanic to get out. Is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> an extraction shooter because you extract? No, it's not like Tarkov at all."</p><p>And therein lies the problem: the mislabelling of games and potential misleading of players. Sides said the "terrible" terminology also makes it very hard to compare games within the extraction shooter genre. Arena Breakout and Escape from Tarkov: yes, they can be compared because they roughly fit the same mould, he said. But Arc Raiders and Tarkov? Nope. "Comparing Arc Raiders to maybe Rust could fit," he said, "and then Rust - is that an extraction? Because it's survival...</p>
<p>"It's a problem," he went on. "I cannot stand the name of it. When you say 'the extraction genre', it should hit your spot. It's really the fact that the genre doesn't even know what it is. You, as a player - how do you know what you’re going to get? And that's one of the real issues with the genre itself."</p>
<p>Chris Sides left Bungie in 2024 to become a freelance consultant, and to create a new studio making something he's not ready to talk about yet, he said in the podcast. Marathon, meanwhile, continues to wobble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">having received vicious feedback in a technical test last year</a>, then disappearing from the release schedule, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">to reappear very recently amidst pledges by publisher Sony that the game will be released by March 2026</a>. Whether it will arrive then - and in what shape it will arrive - we cannot yet know.</p>

<p>SEGA has announced an increase of 10% in the average monthly salary of all employees from April 2026, following significant wage increases in 2023.</p>



<p>The sweep of changes will come into effect from April 1, 2026, providing major boosts to existing employees and future additions to the company with a rise in base salary.</p>







<h2 id="h-sega-boosts-salaries-once-again">SEGA Boosts Salaries Once Again</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is one of SEGA’s big releases this year. Image by Sega</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release in Japan</a>, SEGA announced a decision to “revise the salary levels of full-time employees” and a raise to the starting salary of new employees, “with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices.”</p>



<p>SEGA also outlined an intention of “recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness.”</p>



<p>As a result of the changes, which come into effect next year, the base salary of employees of SEGA in Japan will rise “by an average of approximately 10%.” In addition, the starting salary for university graduates will increase by 10% from 300,000 yen to 330,000 yen—an increase of around $193.</p>



<p>Alongside the wage structure rises, SEGA is also planning to establish “a compensation system that rewards employees according to their roles and contributions,” as well as expanding measures “that support working styles that allow each employee to live the life that suits them best.”</p>



<p>This includes the ‘Fami+ System’, which supports childcare and nursing care, and the ‘Job+ System’, which supports side jobs aimed at creating new innovations.</p>



<p>The boost in salary comes three years after a huge increase in 2023, which saw a rise of around 30% to base salaries at the company.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Nexon, publisher of Embark Studios' latest popular extraction shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, has come forward to further elaborate on his thoughts on AI use in video game development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html">In an interview with Gamespark</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translated by Automaton</a>), CEO Junghun Lee was asked how big an impact emerging technologies - including AI - will have on future Nexon games. To this he responded with a positive outlook on the controversial tech: "The introduction of AI has greatly improved the efficiency of game production processes and live-service operations. In that sense, it feels like the 'average' of games and live services is gradually improving."</p>
<p>He continued: "First of all, I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it's important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p>

<p>Lee stated that "human creativity" is the answer to that question, a belief that echoes what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders">Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg said earlier this year</a>. In that discussion, Strandberg emphasised "there's no shortcut to making great games", believing that developer creativity and ideas remains crucial to making games like Arc Raiders.</p><p>Still, Lee's stance that it's important to assume every game company is using AI is a contested one. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w">Strange Scaffold founder Xavier Nelson Jr responded</a> publicly to these claims by dubbing them "normalisation bullshit", posting on Bluesky: "The people who will most profit from this quality and connection-sapping technology being assumed to be inevitable, want you to give up on pushing against it today, by believing that fight is already over."</p>
<p>Tommy Thompson, founder of AI video game analyst company AI in Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tommy.aiandgames.com/post/3m5geygzyzs2r">also pushed back on Lee's stance</a>. Thompson rejected the claim all other development studios have embraced AI, and that very few who have explored it have gone "all in".</p>
<p>Thompson elaborated: "These generous flourishing statements are in vogue especially in Japan, where the governments 'AI Action Plan' published last summer expects businesses to show they're embracing the technology." It's worth noting that Nexon, which was founded in South Korea, moved its headquarters to Tokyo, Japan in 2005.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that a report from Tokyo Game Show found that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game studios are using AI in development</a></p>
<p>So, as you can see, the debate around AI usage in video game development remains a fierce one. If you want to read up about Arc Raiders and it's use of AI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not give Eurogamer's Arc Raiders review a read</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="5b70fc2c352b4"><a title="PS5 / Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b70fc2c352b4/ps5-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping an eye on our weekly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/japanese-charts-dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-remake-shoves-pokemon-off-the-podium">Japanese Charts</a>, then you'll know that the Switch and Switch 2 have been consistently dominating the hardware space, with Sony's PS5 struggling to get a foothold in the region (and let's not even mention Xbox).</p>
<p>That's not to say it hasn't doesn't well, mind you, with the console surpassing a total of 7 million units across the Base model, Digital Edition, and Pro. But with the Switch 2 already well on its way to 3 million sales just five months after its launch, you can bet the higher-ups at Sony will be quaking in their shiny loafers.</p>
<p>So, as announced during the recent State of Play, a new region-locked PS5 Digital Edition will launch in Japan at 55,000 yen (approx $350), making it comfortably the cheapest console from Sony's lineup. By comparison, the regular Digital Edition is significantly more expensive at 72,980 yen (approx $473).</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds familiar, then it should, because Nintendo chose to go down the same route when it launched the Switch 2 back in June, offering a region-locked console for just 49,980 yen (approx $322). This proved to be a wise decision, with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/switch-2s-cheaper-region-locked-version-is-overwhelmingly-popular-among-japans-2-2-million-pre-order-applicants-survey-suggests/">data from initial lottery pre-orders</a> indicating that 69.7% of applicants opted for the region-locked console with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. A further 27.5% chose the region-locked console on its own, while only 2.9% went for the multi-language model.</p>
<p>So it seems safe to assume, then, that if it weren't for the cheaper region-locked Switch 2, the new console might not be enjoying such a strong start in Japan. Now that Sony is opting for the same approach, it seems like the company is getting increasingly desperate to close the gap before the Switch 2 completely crushes its competition.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting that for both companies, the yen is still pretty weak in Japan right now. It's been on an accelerating decline for a while, sinking to values not seen since the '90s. So it's no surprise to see Nintendo and Sony taking some pretty drastic steps in the region to shift product.</p>
<p>That said, the PS5 has proved to be a pretty major success worldwide, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ps5-sales-now-top-84-2-million-units-well-on-way-to-100-million-milestone">selling over 84.2 million units since its launch in 2020</a>. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">recently surpassed 10 million units worldwide</a>, with Nintendo forecasting a total of 19 million for the current financial year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In July 2024, a leaked presentation practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Aliens Fireteam Elite 2, a sequel to the cooperative third-person shooter game released by Cold Iron Studios in 2021. The presentation revealed several details about the game, such as the availability of five character archetypes (Swift, Deadly, Silent, Commander, Ranger), each with their own unique primary weapons and abilities, and the inclusion of Annihilation mode, which was said to be inspired by classic Horde modes with more variety in encounters and objectives.</p>



<p>It also stated that the studio's goal was to release the game in 2025, but there has been no such confirmation. Indeed, a few hours ago, Enad Global 7 (which had also published the first game) announced (as <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/11/11/eg7-q3-2025-palia-continues-to-be-daybreaks-shining-star-as-cold-irons-project-avo-is-delayed-to-q3-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by MassivelyOP</a>) that it is investing up to an additional $6.5 million in the next game developed by Cold Iron Studios, which now has an official release window of Q3 2026. Cold Iron is also going to invest an additional $1.2 million out of its own pockets.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/daybreak-advances-cold-iron-partnership-with-an-additional-investment-of-up-to-usd-6-5-million-and-updates-the-games-target-release-window-to-third-quarter-of-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> does not actually name Aliens Fireteam Elite 2. Still, given the previous leak, the developer, and the fact that this upcoming title is also a 'co-op action shooter based on a major film IP franchise', it's fair to expect there will be no surprises in that regard.</p>



<p>The first game didn't exactly provoke thrilling emotions in franchise fans, or indeed genre fans. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/aliens-fireteam-elite-against-one-horror-against-many-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto gave it just 6 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>The Colonial Marines and military types of the Aliens universe would normally be a perfect fit for the style of co-op shooter that Cold Iron Studios was aiming for but unfortunately Aliens: Fireteam Elite misses the mark by a wide margin. Instead of celebrating the sheer power of the Colonial Marines, these three-man fireteams are simply trying to survive being mobbed down by waves of mindless, fast-moving zombies with the added ability of being able to crawl on walls. The potential of building up a badass Doc was quickly ruined with the realization that there just isn't much incentive to keep grinding away for minimal returns.</em></p>

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-a-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-with-a-boatload-of-toads">Announced earlier this week</a>, we're expecting to see the first official trailer for the new film. Nintendo has stated there will be no game information during the presentation.

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-the-mario-movie-sequel">first revealed the film's name back in September</a>, along with a tease of what to expect.</p>
<p>
The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be heavily inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games (obviously), so we're expecting a reveal of Yoshi at last.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the green dinosaur's inclusion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doh-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-leaks-come-from-the-most-unlikely-place">leaked earlier this week thanks to some Pilsbury cookie packaging</a>. D'ough!
</p>
<p>
Are there any other characters you're hoping to see in the new film?

</section></header><section>

<p>After cropping up back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> made another haunting appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play</a> showcase, and what do you know, it got a release date this time.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that the next spooky remake will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>12th March 2026</strong>. Pre-orders open today on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series, though Koei Tecmo states that we Switch 2 fans will have to wait until "a later date" to bagsy our copies.</p>
<p>As the latest trailer showcases, the remake has seen a pretty substantial upgrade in the visual and sound departments, with Minakami Village and its wraiths packing an extra level of creepy detail. There are also some new features this time, including focus, zoom and filters for your Camera Obscura, and the ability to hold Mayu's hand for a much-needed health and spirit boost.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, the game's <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/zero/crimson-re/uk/specs/">official website</a> states that the Switch 2 version will run at 1080p / 30fps, with no support for HDR. That said, there is the option to move the Camera Obscura with gyro aiming in handheld mode, so that's something.</p>
<p>The game will soon be available to pre-order in both its standard and 'Digital Deluxe' forms — the latter of which throws in a digital soundtrack, digital artbook and a handful of bonus costumes for Mio and Mayu.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aion-2-to-launch-globally-in-the-second-half-of-2026-monetization-to-be-less-aggressive-than-throne-and-liberty.1350880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During its Q3 2025 quarterly report (as <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/11/11/ncsoft-q3-2025-guild-wars-2-delivers-solid-results-as-aion-2-sets-2h-2026-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by MassivelyOP</a>), NCSoft announced that Aion 2 will debut on the global stage in the second half of 2026. The MMORPG is set to launch in exactly a week from today in South Korea and Taiwan for PC and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Aion 2 is a direct sequel to the 2009 classic MMORPG. It's set roughly 200 years after the events seen in that game. Its massive game world is estimated to be around 1,200 square kilometers and features distinct biomes like dusty frontier towns, icy peaks, flowing rivers, and hidden labs. Just like in the original, flight mechanics are included both for exploration and aerial combat. Players can also look forward to eight classes, more than 200 dungeons (between the solo and group ones), various PvP modes (large-scale faction warfare between the Elyos and Asmodian, but also 1v1, 4v4, 8v8 arenas), and other systems like housing. In the investors' call, NCSoft promised that Aion 2 would feature less aggressive monetization compared to Throne and Liberty, which in turn should 'secure a bigger userbase'. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-to-launch-globally-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a couple of weeks ago, the game, powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>2026 is poised to be a significant year for NCSoft, with the launch of Aion 2 and other key titles, including Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers, and Time Takers. We covered Cinder City from Gamescom 2025; it's an intriguing open world third-person shooter with MMO-like elements coming in 2026 to PC and consoles. Check out our exclusive interview with the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Limit Zero Breakers, developed by VIC GAME STUDIOS, is a free-to-play anime-style cooperative action RPG due in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3764400/LIMIT_ZERO_BREAKERS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and mobile. In the game, a team of adventurers known as 'Breakers' explores a fragmented, corrupted world from atop a powerful airship, searching for the mythical 'Library of the Gods'. During battle, players unleash stylish attacks and combinations against enormous creatures lurking in ancient dungeons, striving to restore peace to the continent of Seraphia.</p>



<p>As for Time Takers, it's a third-person team-based shooter for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and consoles that features Time Energy as a unique resource that players can spend on reviving teammates or upgrading skills, for example. </p>



<p>Arguably, though, the most exciting game in NCSoft's whole upcoming lineup could be the one set to be announced tomorrow at G-Star 2025. According to rumors, it might be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon </a>MMO we first heard about three years ago. Earlier this year, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> it had been canceled, but that might have been incorrect. We'll know for sure in a few hours.</p>

            <p>Yep, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are definitely planning to release some DLC for the action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-planned-to-drop-by-march-next-year-fromsoftwares-big-corporate-bosses-reveal">by March 2026</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation blog</a> about the DLC speaks of the "Great Hollow", a big hole that's opened up in the depths of Limveld, shifting the earth. It's filled with ancient ruins, life-sapping crystals, and also lots of things that want to take your lunch money.</p>
<p>Venturing forth as your tried and tested Nightfarer or one of the two new ones added by the DLC, you'll come face to face with bosses like Shadow of the Erdtree's Dancing Lion and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>' abyss-battling knight Artorias. Don't worry, I'm sure they won't be too tough, especially if you accept those fresh shoes and take them on as the Scholar, a nerdy Nightfarer with big book smarts, or the Undertaker, an abbess with lots of strength, faith, and presumably the ability to immediately reassure anyone she says "my condolences" to.</p><p>As for how it'll all fit in lore-wise, FromSoft had the following to say: "In our war against the Night, every battle left a scar. These wounds were given will. A foul life, born of cast-away souls. Steel your resolve, Nightfarers. This hunt must be seen to its end." There's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1988380951978861023">also chatter</a> about someone called "the Dreglord" and how they must be sliced, spelled or smacked out of existence in this tale of post-night battling. Odds are they're the weird thing which roars near the end of the trailer, with the studio being quite coy about both them and the gang of angelic fighters pictured in the new threats section of the PS blog.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you waltz over to your old buddy Artorias on December 4th, he'll be happy to give you the rundown.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> is "surprised" that Xbox has "not yet fully embraced" the newly released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, as part of a discussion on third-party support.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>, Fils-Aimé stated Nintendo will "never position itself as a direct competitor to PlayStation", though the company would "welcome some of the latest core gamer-type of content". Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-talks-switch-2-support-says-nintendo-a-great-partner">Phil Spencer, meanwhile, called Nintendo a "great partner"</a> and confirmed support for the Switch 2, though little has been announced so far.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," said Fils-Aimé. "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that. I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday.</p>

<p>"All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Fils-Aimé also noted that Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox are no longer directly competing, due to their differing approaches this generation. While PlayStation focuses on premium products and exclusives, and Nintendo remains focused on its hybrid console series, Xbox is moving further into publishing.</p><p>"I do think that the years of direct competition are done," said Fils-Aimé. "With a large part of the Xbox business now being publishing, by definition, they're a big third-party publisher that also makes some hardware. From that standpoint, they are no longer directly competing with the PlayStation business. And in fact, they need support from Sony for Microsoft's software to reach the largest audience. And as I said earlier, I think it would be in their best interest to find ways for Xbox software, beyond Minecraft, to make its way onto the Nintendo platform. So, from that standpoint, direct warfare is over.</p>
<p>"But, on the other hand, gamers out there have limited budgets. You have to win for every dollar spent; you need to win for every minute spent playing. And so there's always going to be a war going on. It may be below the surface, but there's always going to be a battle for attention and mindshare."</p>
<p>Last year, Xbox games Pentiment and Grounded made their way to the Switch and were set to be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, though that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-report">reportedly shifted to Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is officially coming to Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Xbox announced its long-time exclusive Halo is headed to PS5</a>. Could Switch 2 also be on the cards?</p>
