This game acted as a successor to the <em>Dirt </em>series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McRae_Rally_and_Dirt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McRae_Rally_and_Dirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which itself had connections to the studio’s earlier <em>Colin McRae Rally</em> franchise</a></span> that started all the way back on the original PlayStation. But the more disappointing news for fans is that Codemasters is done making rally games altogether. </p><p>As announced in the Wednesday update, Codemasters is “pausing” all current development on future dirt racing rally games, effectively killing the <em>Dirt/Colin McRae </em>rally franchise after two decades and 10+ entries. The last entry in the <em>Dirt </em>franchise,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dirt-5-year-one-edition?_gl=1*170ur3a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dirt-5-year-one-edition?_gl=1*170ur3a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Dirt 5</em>, launched in 2020</a></span>.  <em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to EA for more information. </p><p>“For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles,” explained Codemasters. “Our [World Rally Championship] partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally?_gl=1*1yt714s*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally?_gl=1*1yt714s*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Colin McRae Rally</em></a></span>, and <em>Dirt</em>. We’ve provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.”</p><p>The studio promised fans that EA Sports <em>WRC </em>will continue to be “available” to new and existing players, so thankfully it doesn’t sound like the team’s last rally game will be delisted and shut down anytime soon. Still, it’s a shame to see the studio stepping away from rally racing after nearly 30 years of excellent games in a genre that is often ignored by other studios and publishers.</p><p>Codemasters will continue to develop other racing games, like EA’s yearly <em>F1 </em>series and possibly (hopefully) future entries in the track racer franchise <em>Grid</em>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Individual Reliquaries vary in price but cost less than the game's old 90-tier battle pass, though they can all be bought together for the same $10 price as previous battle passes. Rewards can also be chosen in any order by spending tokens, rather than having to grind through potentially dozens of levels for a player to reach a particular reward that interests them. As in previous seasons, there are still free seasonal rewards for those who don't want to pay but still participate in the season, this time in the form of this season's Belial's Return Reliquary.</p><p dir="ltr">While being able to specifically purchase particular types of cosmetics and unlock specific rewards first is nice, the number of rewards on offer in total is far less than Diablo 4's old battle passes, something that has not gone unnoticed by players.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's the removal of 500 Platinum (the game's premium currency used to purchase the battle pass and in-game shop cosmetics) from the battle pass that is causing the most outrage. In previous seasons, Diablo 4's premium battle pass awarded 700 Platinum. That was still 300 short of being able to purchase next season's battle pass, as in many other live-service games, and a controversy in and of itself. Diablo 4 Season 8's battle pass now only offers 200 Platinum in total.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the most popular posts on the Diablo 4 subreddit currently is one comparing the old battle pass to the new one from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kav4ce/reliquaries_are_a_massive_downgrade_born_from/?rdt=47498" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITheDarkitect</a>, who breaks down the differences between free and premium rewards offered under previous seasons and in Season 8. They note how the new premium Reliquary doesn't offer any emotes, headstones, titles, or emblems like previous battle passes, as well as the loss of additional Platinum for those who buy the premium version.</p><p dir="ltr">"The massive downgrade, especially the 500 Platinum cut, and the supposed 'freedom of choice' that pretends to make it better, don't surprise me at all," ITheDarkitect writes. "I'll spend my money somewhere else."</p><p dir="ltr">What changes Blizzard may make in the future is unclear, but it doesn't seem Blizzard is likely to make dramatic changes to Reliquaries in Season 8. The new system will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Diablo 4's upcoming crossover with Berserk starting on May 6</a> and last until the end of the season.</p>

		<p>Frontier has now previewed what’s next for their latest theme park management game, Planet Coaster 2, with a new roadmap for May and June.</p>
<p>Arriving on 29th May is Update 5, which will include fan requested features like security guards and expanded colour customisations. The Sci-Fi theme will also return, while there’s two de-themed coasters that will allow for greater customisation alongside the returning Vector – Return Mk 2, and the maps from Act 3 of the career will be available in Sandbox mode.</p>



<p>Looking further ahead to June, Update 6 will bring Souvenir Shops and On-Ride Photos that will be sold at those shops (at no doubt extortionate prices!). There will be more stock coasters and the returning Coriolis ride, and then more ongoing stability and performance enhancements. Another returning theme is also teased, with Frontier saying that “It’s a real fairy tale come true.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 launched at the tail end of 2024, Frontier looking to find new ways to expand on their popular theme park game with a fresh release, instead of bolting on features with DLC and patches. In particular, they added new water park areas with water slides, wide plaza areas and more, though fans initially complained that it felt like a step back in terms of the number of themes and certain features, and some bugginess. Frontier has steadily worked to add more to the game since then, resolving key complaints and generally making improvements, and it seems that it’s kicking into gear with the next few updates.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/planet-coaster-2-review/">our Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, Dom said, “Frontier’s park-building sequel is a vibe, it is a mood, and it is sunshine wrapped in a very bright bow. Minor control frustrations aside, it’s the best theme park builder out there, with impressively deep customisation, beautifully detailed visuals and the ability to make hours of your life melt away.”</p>

			<p>Earlier today, some users <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found references to multiplayer modes in Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, reigniting a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulated even before the game's launch</a>.</p>
<p>However, this afternoon, Ubisoft Quebec shared the full year-one roadmap, and there's no mention at all of any multiplayer modes. They may be keeping it a secret until a later announcement, but I wouldn't count on it. On the other hand, here's what is definitely coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows in the next twelve months:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first update will land in a week from today, on May 6. It will add a new story quest titled 'The Works of Luis Frois', a Codex update, and some quality of life improvements.</li>
<li>In late May, Ubisoft Quebec plans to release another sizable update featuring a special collaboration with another franchise. Moreover, the patch will introduce new parkour interactions requested by the community, including height-gaining back flips, fully re-animated height-gaining side flips, and a brand-new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This move allows both playable characters to jump and grab onto canopies and lower overhangs—a move that's particularly handy when wall running isn't an option.</li>
<li>In June, another story drop is coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows. That includes a new story quest and a new ally for the League. Moreover, the developers will add the Alarm System to the open world, new difficulty settings, and several immersion options like toggles for weapon glints during combat, black-and-white-and-red ability filters, target assassination celebration effects, and stealth outlines. Lastly, players will be able to toggle their headgear during dialogues and cutscenes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the rest of 2025, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be updated with the New Game Plus mode, new story drops, more quality-of-life enhancements, more special collaborations, more Codex updates, Animus content and rewards, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that will introduce a new region with over 10 hours of content. As a reminder, Claws of Awaji is free for anyone who pre-ordered the game, while pricing for everyone else still needs to be communicated.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has done very well for Ubisoft</a>, largely keeping the publisher afloat during its restructuring, which culminated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new subsidiary</a> whose sole purpose is to control the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six IPs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/slop-nintendo-switch-eshop-best-seller-firmware-update-1851778523<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> The Nintendo Switch received a major firmware update today that paves the way for its integration with the Switch 2 and institutes a less than stellar new regime of virtual game sharing. But firmware version 20.0.0 also made some other equally notable but less advertised changes, including a major shift to how Nintendo ranks best-selling games in the eShop. The result could have big ramifications for how games are discovered on one of the biggest console install-bases in history, and could help alleviate <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248">some of the platform’s “slop” problem</a></span>. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,194644,196773" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Prior to Wednesday’s update, the “Best Sellers” section of the eShop covered the last 14 days and was arranged by total downloads. Now, however, the list is arranged by total revenue a game has generated from just the last three days. The shift was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GVG</em></a></span> and documented at length on YouTube. “Hell has frozen over, folks, and Nintendo has massively changed chart discoverability with the latest Switch eShop OS update—in such a way that makes it clear that it’ll also carry through to the Switch 2,” game discoverability expert <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://lnkd.in/gPRBN5P5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://lnkd.in/gPRBN5P5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Carless</a></span> posted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7323333696051150848/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7323333696051150848/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on LinkedIn</a></span> following the news. <br></p><p>While there’s s still an option to revert to the previous view, the eShop now defaults to ranking games by revenue rather than individual units sold. Carless speculates that could stop companies from trying to game the charts by running steep discounts to gin up downloads, an incentive structure that led to lots of shovelware crowding out better quality games on the best sellers list. But he adds that it will also make it harder for cheaper games, including lots of smaller indie titles, to compete for high-ranking slots against pricier blockbusters. </p><p>So what does this change look like in practice? Just about every game in the best seller list, with the exception of <em>Minecraft</em>, is different than it was a couple days ago, according to <em>GVG</em>’s comparison. The chart heavily favors games that aren’t on sale and Nintendo games in particular, with seven of the top 12 being first-party releases. The deals list has similarly been skewed away from just the games that are the most discounted, now heavily featuring those that are both heavily discounted and selling well. I had to scroll for a bit before stumbling on an obvious shovelware cash grab like <em>I Am Busy Digging A Hole</em>, an asset-flip sim aimed at capitalizing on the success of the similarly titled <em>A Game About Digging A Hole</em> which is only on Steam at the moment.</p><p>Unfortunately, on the best seller list at least, you have to toggle over to the “download only” list before you start to see lots of smaller indie games, though even those are dominated by existing winners. The <em>Gloomhaven</em>-inspired party RPG <em>Sunderfolk</em> was the only recently released game in the top 10 when I looked today. As <em>GVG </em>mentions in its video, the eShop change has gone a long way to pushing “slop” off of the discoverability pages, but it’s also done the same to many indie releases. Also the storefront is still incredibly sluggish and loads like molasses. The Switch 2 version can’t come soon enough.</p><p>What else could Nintendo do to improve store browsing in the meantime? Some developers have suggested a new browser tab purely for curated picks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pushtotalk.gg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Push to Talk</em></a></span>’s Ryan Rigney recommended a new and trending section that takes into account the eShop’s own wishlisting system and other users’ activity on the store, similar to how Valve seemingly does it on Steam. Any new options would be better than none at all, though it’s interesting to see Nintendo tinkering more with the eShop now than it has in almost the entirety of the Switch’s existence (people also have strong feelings about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/rip-orange-eshop-nintendo-fans-bid-farewell-to-iconic-switch-color&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rip-orange-eshop-nintendo-fans-bid-farewell-to-iconic-switch-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the move from orange to red</a></span>). </p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Nintendo’s developers said earlier this month. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.” They’ve promised better speed, overall performance, and a new “Game Finds” feature for more easily scrolling through images and videos on the Switch 2's eShop, though it doesn’t sound like any of those improvements will be trickling back down to the older hardware. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a brief but enlightening video with a specific schedule for May and June as the team behind the latest stealth-action entry plots out how it will keep fans coming back with free updates throughout the year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-1746033627143.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows post-launch roadmap.

It’ll be accompanied by a Codex update and a few quality-of-life improvements, with relatively substantial parkour additions and a photo mode update also set to arrive next month. These adjustments and more are part of what Ubisoft says is a continued effort to listen to its community and take their feedback into consideration for future Assassin’s Creed Shadows updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback has been a core focus of the team throughout development, and that’s not stopping now that Shadows is released,” community developer Daniel St. Germain explained in today’s video. “Regular title updates are coming, each with impactful additions – and changes – based on your feedback and requests, with some bug fixes to continue refining the experience across all platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next free Assassin’s Creed Shadows story drop will follow in June, as will more challenging difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, an open-world alarm system, and an option to keep headgear on or off during cutscenes. These are worthwhile changes that players are already looking to see included, but more features, such as new game+ support, additional story drops, special collaborations, and more, are expected to arrive before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest item on the post-launch roadmap is the first proper Assassin’s Creed Shadows DLC expansion, Claws of Awaji, which drops at an unspecified point later in the year. It’s said to include new content, such as the Bo staff weapon and a new region for Naoe and Yasuke to explore, across its 10-hour journey. Pricing details have yet to be revealed, though it will at least be free for those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows before its launch last month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed Shadows arrived for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20 and finally takes Ubisoft’s long-running stealth series to Feudal Japan.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a> presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">The video begins with a slow pan over a peaceful shoreline, where we see one beachgoing Mii casually toot while asleep on a beach chair. The trailer then showcases a handful of different Miis going about their daily lives on the island, from an elderly man breakdancing in front of a crowd to a pair of characters angrily throwing items at each other during a heated argument.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Tomodachi_Life_gameplay_details">Tomodachi Life gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream marks the third installment in Nintendo's quirky life-sim series, and while many details about the game are still up in the air, it appears the series' hallmark gameplay and humor are intact.</p><p dir="ltr">In past installments, players would create (or import) Mii characters and have them live together on an island community, watching as the Miis went about their day-to-day lives. They could work part-time jobs, take strolls along the beach, and visit each other’s apartments, which often resulted in humorous interactions.</p><p dir="ltr">In contrast to Tomodachi Life for 3DS, where each Mii occupied a different apartment in one shared building, it appears the Miis in Living the Dream will live in their own small houses. A clothing store and supermarket can also be spotted in the background of the announcement trailer, hinting that players will still be able to purchase outfits and meals for the Miis. However, it remains to be seen if the Miis can still get married and have children.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the sequel to Obsidian's comedic sci-fi RPG, is set to release later this year. Obsidian's second major release of 2025 following Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2 has been pitched as a bigger and better version of the original, expanding the scope of the game while adding in more ways to approach situations. Obsidian RPGs are well known for giving you a variety of ways to solve a problem, and The Outer Worlds 2 seems to be continuing that tradition.</p><p dir="ltr">While The Outer Worlds 2 still hasn't been fully revealed by Microsoft, with just a release window for later this year, it has been confirmed that the second half of Xbox's June showcase will be a deep dive on The Outer Worlds 2, likely giving a release date and more information about the RPG.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Outer_Worlds_2_be_released_">When will The Outer Worlds 2 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_announcement_trailer">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_platforms">The Outer Worlds 2 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_story__setting__and_characters">The Outer Worlds 2 story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_gameplay">The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_development_news">The Outer Worlds 2 development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_The_Outer_Worlds_2_be_released_">When will The Outer Worlds 2 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 currently has a release window of 2025. Microsoft is likely announcing a more exact date at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/">Xbox June showcase</a>, where The Outer Worlds 2 will be the main focus of a Direct following the showcase. While we don't know when the release will fall, we do at least know it won't be prior to that June showcase.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_announcement_trailer">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rvTE-3S4c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer was released in 2019, featuring only a CG cutscene. At The Game Awards in 2024, a second trailer was released, showing off the gameplay of The Outer Worlds 2, along with the 2025 release window. The trailer itself shows a decent amount of gameplay, from normal shooting to invisible sneaking and high-octane explosions, but it doesn't focus on the narrative of The Outer Worlds too much. Instead, it focuses on the fact that Obsidian has made a number of highly regarded sequels in the past, like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 and Fallout: New Vegas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_platforms">The Outer Worlds 2 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 is releasing on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. As an Xbox Game Studios title, it will be available on Game Pass for both console and PC at launch, alongside the option to purchase it at full price. At the time of writing, The Outer Worlds 2 has not been confirmed to be releasing on the Nintendo Switch 2, although Xbox has expressed interest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-doesnt-make-microsoft-nervous-about-its-own-next-gen-plans-phil-spencer-says/1100-6530893/">supporting the Switch 2</a> and the first game did come to the Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_story__setting__and_characters">The Outer Worlds 2 story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">While most story details have yet to be revealed, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> for The Outer Worlds 2 does have the basic premise. You play as the Earth Directorate agent, tasked with uncovering the source of devastating rifts in Arcadia. The Arcadia colonies are currently in a war as the Protectorate's rule is challenged by rebels. Oddly enough, the outsider with government authority trying to solve a massive problem is very similar to the pitch for Avowed, although the way the narrative shakes out over the course of the game will likely be different.</p><p dir="ltr">While more details haven't been shared just yet, the Steam page also confirms the return of companions and emphasizes player choice when it comes to how you tackle quests, both in the main story and side quests.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_gameplay">The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484992"></a><figcaption>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature a variety of sci-fi weaponry.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg"></figure><p>The Outer Worlds 2 appears to have feature gameplay similar to the original, but refined. As shown in a gameplay video (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhDvnM3wBaQ">IGN</a>), it's a first-person RPG, where--depending on how you like to play--you will be shooting, sneaking, and stabbing your way through enemies in combat encounters. If you have played the original, Avowed, or Fallout 4, you have a pretty good idea of how combat can flow. You will also be looting--both enemies and chests--gathering materials, valuables, and new gear.</p><p dir="ltr">That's just combat of course, as you will also spend a decent amount of time talking to NPCs. How these conversations go depends on your build, letting you play anyone from a charismatic smooth-talker to an intimidating brute. You can also use food and drugs to give stat boosts, letting you appear to be charming, even if you aren't. There will also be plenty of main missions, side quests, and companion missions, if it's similar to the first game.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_development_news">The Outer Worlds 2 development news</h2><p>Development news has been fairly light for The Outer Worlds 2 since its reveal in 2019. After that, there was a trailer at The Game Awards 2024, and a few gameplay videos have been released in the time since. However, The Outer Worlds 2 is getting a deep dive at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8, with a Direct focus entirely on the game after the main showcase. Xbox has done a couple of these single-game presentations after the main show in recent years, typically spending 20-30 minutes deep-diving into the game and interviewing developers. That is likely the next time news about the game will be revealed, including a release date.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has revealed what players should expect in the first year of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with the studio releasing the year one roadmap for the game. Included in the first year are free missions called Story Drops, the first expansion called the Claws of Awaji, New Game+, and further updates to Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Year 1 Roadmap Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LLB-WNvQEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Claws of Awaji expansion, which will be available at no additional cost to those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows, will add the island of Awaji and continues the story of both Yasuke and Naoe following the epilogue of the main questline. Naoe will be getting a new weapon with that being the Bo Staff, which can be used to fight the new enemies that will be added to the game. Both characters will be getting additional abilities too.</p>
<p>Another new addition to Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be story drops, free quests that expand upon the backstories of various characters. These story drops will also add new abilities and new activities in the world. The first of these story drops will be “The Works of Luis Frois”, which will focus on the Jesuit scholar whose works had documented a lot of the Sengoku era of Japan. This story drop will be added in early made.</p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, the parkour system in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be optimised and new interactions will be brought in. These include height-gaining back-ejects, reanimated height-gaining side-ejects, and a vertical ledge jumps so characters can grab on to awnings and low overhangs. There will be more parkour improvements added through the year. The photo mode will be improved too, with new poses, expressions, filters, stickers and ambient music. In June, the second community feedback update will be rolled out which will allow players to toggle headgear being visible in cutscenes, giving the option to disable weapon glints and stealth outlines, black-and-white and red ability filters, and assassination celebration effects. The alarm system will be expanded to the open world as well.</p>


<p>In our Assassin’s Creed Shadows review, Adrian said, <em>“Fans of Assassin’s Creed have waited an era or two for a series entry that lets you be a ninja and explore Feudal Japan. Thankfully, the wait has been absolutely worth it. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an astonishing achievement. Vast, impossibly detailed, immaculately researched, and enormously fun, Shadows is easily one of the best games in this storied franchise.”</em></p>

                <p>Flappy Bird, one of the most viral games ever that became massively popular before being delisted by its creator, has returned. There are some key things to know, however, that could give you pause about jumping back in.</p><p>This new version of Flappy Bird comes from The Flappy Bird Foundation Group and was not produced in partnership with series designer Dong Nguyen. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/flappy-bird-studio-addresses-criticism-but-ignores-the-games-biggest-controversy/1100-6526576/" data-ref-id="1100-6526576">announcement in 2024</a> was mired in controversy surrounding cryptocurrency concerns. In the announcement of the new game's launch, the developer said there are "no Web3 elements," despite the company's background in that area.</p><p>Flappy Bird can now be downloaded on Android devices from the Epic Games Store. There is no word yet on if it's also coming to iOS, or if the planned PC edition is still coming, but the developer said more news is on the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbTah7oqj4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ftbTah7oqj4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new Flappy Bird has two modes: Classic and Quest. In Classic, players do what they did 10 years ago, which is tap the screen to make the bird jump to avoid pipes for as long as possible. Quest mode, meanwhile, features levels with set goals, with new content added "regularly."</p><p>Flappy Bird makes money through in-app purchases that remove ads. Players can also buy special helmets that allow players to revive themselves.</p><p>Nguyen originally removed the game in 2014 because he thought it became "an addictive product," which ran counter to his belief that it should be played in short bursts.</p><p>"I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/creator-cites-addictiveness-discomfort-in-pulling-down-flappy-bird/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said at the time.</a></p><p>Nguyen is not involved with the new Flappy Bird and apparently made no money of its return. That's because, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/how-crypto-bros-wrested-flappy-bird-from-its-creator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica reports</a>, a company called Gametech Holdings filed a "notice of opposition" against Nguyen in late 2013. After Nguyen did not respond to the notice, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office canceled his trademark, which gave Gametech the opportunity to acquire it.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for May 2025 have been announced and it’s a pretty good month, featuring tons of dinosaurs, a great boomer shooter, and the Poker-inspired card dealing phenomenon that is Balatro.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus May 2025 games?</span></p>


<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 6th May – no kidding – and they will be available until 2nd June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> | PS5</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/balatro">Balatro</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that it’s a celebrated Game of the Year contender and nominee from last year, Balatro is likely the biggest included here. The game is a roguelike that takes inspiration from Poker hands, asking you to play card combos in order to generate high scores, while collecting Joker cards that add multipliers, boosters and other effects as you play. It’s hugely addictive and was <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">an easy winner for our Best Independent Game award in 2024</a>. </strong>Through 2025, it’s reached even more people as more awards have rolled in, and that attention has led to some interesting collaborations with much bigger budget games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Balatro - Short Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9agt18c_V1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An then there’s Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. Before Space Marine 2 dropped into our laps last year, this was probably up there as the latest and greatest 40K shooter, leaning into the “Boomer Shooter” fad with retro graphics and retro FPS gameplay to match. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “The commitment to ‘the bit’ means that Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun stays true to its old-school shooter roots, with very little signposting, apart from the occasional spot of yellow marking to show you can climb up through an area. Otherwise, you’re left to your own devices. The same goes for storytelling, which extends to your servitor’s asides, short loading screen introductions to each area and the occasional cutscene. It doesn’t hurt it, but there were times where I yearned for a little more explanation.”</p>


<p>Rounding out this month’s selection is Ark: Survival Ascended, the current gen revamp of Ark: Survival Evolved within Unreal Engine 5. This remaster fully implements Unreal Engine’s Lumen lighting, Nanite mesh rendering, and all the other new technologies, while Studio Wildcard has gradually reimplemented all of the DLC maps from the original game over the course of the last year and a half – it’s still in Early Access with the final map planned for release in October. It hasn’t had the smoothest launch or reception, but the game has an enduring popularity regardless. Dinos, am I right?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the April 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 5th May March to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10003485">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002719">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>

		<p>Evil Dead: The Game is being delisted from digital storefronts, Saber Interactive has announced. The statement the company has released follows the disappearance of the game from the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/evil-dead-the-game/">PlayStation Store,</a> among others. Those who own the game will not need to worry about servers being shut down, as it has been made clear that the servers for Evil Dead: The Game will remain online.</p>
<p><iframe title="Evil Dead: The Game - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LiZqKiamYSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement on Steam, Saber Interactive said, <em>“We can confirm we’ve begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts. Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.”</em></p>
<p>The delisting of Evil Dead: The Game comes just shy of three years from the game’s launch date of May 13th, 2022, when it released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where four players face off against a number of villains controlled by another player. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/16/evil-dead-the-game-review/">Evil Dead: The Game Review</a>, Jim said, <em>“Evil Dead fans will love the amount of fan service on offer here, from the painstaking recreation of movie locations to Bruce Campbell’s goofy one-liners. However, when it comes to raw entertainment value, there’s an imbalance between the forces of good and evil. Playing as the survivors can be fun with friends but lacks the fun or variety of being an evildoer.”</em></p>

			<p>EA studio Codemasters had two major announcements for players, one to do with the WRC and DiRT games, and the other with <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/">F1 25</a>.</p>
<p>F1 25 fans get the 'good news' end of the deal, with Codemasters showing off the first gameplay for F1 25, highlighting the reversed tracks, the improvements players will enjoy in F1 25 due to <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">LIDAR scanning</span>, and all the little details in these tracks being rebuilt to really add that extra layer of realism for players keen to jump behind the wheel.</p>
<p>WRC and DiRT fans aren't as lucky, with the confirmation that the 2024 season expansion for EA Sports WRC 2023 is the last expansion from the team, and Codemasters is officially pausing development on future rally racing titles.</p>
<p>"<em>After releasing EA SPORTS WRC in 2023, the 2024 season, including the recently released Hard Chargers Content pack, will be our last expansion. For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players,</em>" Codemasters wrote in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update">blog post</a> on the EA Sports WRC website.</p>
<p>"<em>Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DiRT. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge...Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.</em>"</p>
<p>Back to F1 25, the new gameplay trailer showcases four of the five updated circuits and digs into the improvements made in this iteration.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The tech behind LIDAR gives players unprecedented levels of detail, bringing them closer to each race weekend,</span></em>" creative director at Codemasters Gavin Cooper said in a press release.

Ding ding, it is AI-slop-alypse-O-Clock. Time for another helping of doom-ridden commentary upon the technologies that are busily scraping and remaking all the wit, lore and gibberish accumulated over 30 blessed years of the internet. Here's a cut from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZYR0gEsfg">a Mustard Plays interview</a> with Fortnite product management director Dan Walsh, in which he comments upon the issue of Fortnite players using latter-day generative AI tools to conjure up thumbnail images for their profiles. 
</p>
<p>
While Epic aren't, Walsh says, about to use any genAI when creating their own assets such as character models for Fortnite, they don't really care if players do, as long as the resulting images don't break any rules around graphic violence or similar. Beyond that, Walsh argues that generated images are becoming so tricky to spot that the idea of banning their usage in a game like Fortnite is impractical. Hmmm.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Here's the quote in full, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-wont-police-ai-generated-thumbnail-images-and-epic-games-says-detecting-them-will-likely-become-impossible">Eurogamer</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
 "From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails - like, we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails. All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules. I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect. It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things. So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point where it's probably going to become unenforceable. We're really just focused on - 'does this asset comply with our rules, yes or no?', not 'what tool did you use to make this asset'?" 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's perhaps focussing on the trees, not the wood, but I'm struck by Walsh's suggestion that genAI stuff at large is becoming impossible to detect, inasmuch as it rests on the idea that genAI art currently looks a certain way, that genAI is a kind of artstyle with specific hallmarks. In amongst all the gloom of the genAI industry's impact at the level of livelihoods, energy consumption and conceptions of creativity or culture, I find it endlessly interesting to grapple with what, right now, is considered a symptom or stigma of AI generation. 
</p>
<p>
The obvious signs are outright errors - characters having too many fingers, or objects with reversed proportions. There's also a bottomless seam of syrupy or sparkly genAI material that is evidently born of the understanding that "artistic" means expensive-looking. The goalposts move continually, however, and I do worry that certain creative works are getting misidentified in the urgency to identify the regurgitations. 
</p>
<p>
Works of photorealism, for example, a tradition now heavily associated with fancy computing technology. Or simply projects that wear their inspirations so openly and honestly that they can be falsely interpreted as automatic pastiche. I'm uneasy about the association of genAI with obvious errors - there are plenty of digital artists who make deliberate usage of incorrectness, blemishes, and uncanny disorder. There are plenty of artists who work with more "innocent" forms of generation. Experimental art in general is at risk of being mislabelled because it is supposed to seem counterintuitive, or perverse. 
</p>
<p>
To care about art in the current era of vociferously oversold generated art is to be lumbered with the maintenance of a personal Turing Test methodology that must be continually updated as the genAI tools themselves change. Inasmuch as there's anything positive or "fun" about having billion-dollar image-scramblers dumped on us by a collection of big corporations in need of double-digit growth, it's being obliged to engage more closely with all sorts of artistic traditions, so as to sort the human-crafted stuff from the bot fabulations.</p>
<p>Anyway, this probably should have been a proper editorial. I started writing a news piece and got carried away. It happens! What do you look for when you're trying to identify a piece of AI-generated art? Do you think that certain image generation tools have particular visual hallmarks?

Then, he went on to shout out another current RPG in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. "Even after you finish Expedition 33, this Japanese cult game will still be here, waiting for you!" <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1916525336373952567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Kodaka.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He went on to praise Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in a follow-up post, drawing a comparison between the two games' unique takes on their respective genres.

"Hundred Line has its own unique charm too, so why not play!!!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall Interactive seemed to notice the shout-outs, and the official Expedition 33 account <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1917500503627555303" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a message</a> from creative director Guillaume Broche:</p><blockquote>"After your Expedition, check out The Hundred Line, another great turn-based RPG that was also released last week, and made with love by an awesome team.

Over 18,000 released on Steam last year alone. By any metric, that's a baffling number, and even games with newsworthy creators may struggle to reach audiences in the massive flood of new things to play.

Two mobile games were released simultaneously, <em>Cube Escape: The Lake</em> and <em>Cube Escape: Seasons</em>. Each, at first glance, appeared to be part of the current trend for both digital and real-world escape room games, in which you solved puzzles to set yourself free from some kind of intricately locked enclosure. But very quickly it became apparent that this was something <em>different</em>. Rusty Lake is not the sort of place from which anyone escapes. And ten years later, with a brand new game to celebrate, we’re still trapped within its Lynchian aberrations.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196663,196345" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Ten years and an extraordinary 18 games, one film, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rustylakeuntold.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rustylakeuntold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">table-top RPG</a></span> later, people are still trying to piece together the mysteries of Rusty Lake, the various buildings in the very small town (the Cabin, the Chapel, a Cave, a Mill, the Vanderboom home, and of course the Hotel), and the unsettling figures who appear throughout its history like Mr Crow and Mr Owl. We know the Lake needs our memories, and we know that once the negative ones are extracted from people—in the form of black cubes—they become Corrupted Souls. And we know there’s a damned weird obsession with shrimps. But the real joy of <em>Rusty Lake</em> is that, as with the David Lynch films that heavily inspired it, we also know complete, coherent answers will always be just out of reach.</p><figure id="" data-id="706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-recommend-id="image://706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-recommend-id="image://706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Earlier this year, with the 10th anniversary looming, I thought it would be a good time to replay every game in the series, in release order, to try to get myself on top of what these games are about. I’m genuinely delighted to report that at the end of this process, from <em>Cube Escape: The Lake</em> through to <em>Underground Blossom</em>, and indeed the shadow-dropped-as-this-post-goes-live <em>The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show</em>, I’m none the wiser. I can tell you these are games about burdened families, dark secrets passed through generations, and a lake with an insatiable desire for memories, but the “why” and the “how” fade into irrelevance in the shadow of such an incredible atmosphere of haunting malevolence, and a permanent wicked glint in the series’ eye.</p><p>On a more pragmatic level, these are games created in that modern, touchscreen-driven style of a point-and-click puzzle game. You explore locations, gather items for your inventory, and listen to the peculiar utterings of the inhabitants, attempting to solve puzzles that usually end up pointing toward the appearance of mystical cubes. But rather than the genre’s usual predictable results, in a <em>Rusty Lake</em> game you’re far more likely to discover that using the hammer on the nail causes a crack in a wall to unveil a fish, which when used on the right character will cause them to die, falling to the ground with their mouth open, into which you then travel to discover an impossible chamber within their body. There’s one game in which you slice off a man’s nipple in order to travel into the bizarre realm hidden behind it.</p><p>Yet despite this overtly surreal approach, the <em>Rusty Lake</em> games maintain a sense of order, a notion that—even if you can never quite grasp their wraith-like tendrils—there <em>is</em> an internal coherence here.

Sharing an interest in the inherent spookiness of owls is one thing; writing “THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM” on a wall in <em>Rusty Lake Paradise</em> was pushing it too far.

(Seriously, you have to play it.) It’s presented as a series of mini-puzzles, a stage show being put on by the magician rabbit, in which you must arrange objects and colors or successfully sproing baby rabbits from a top hat such that they land in another hat on the floor (rather than miss and land in a bloody splat), in order to bring on the next scene. And honestly, as I was playing, I was thinking—hmmm, this isn’t quite it. But the game knew that, and then a whole bunch of other stuff happens, and it’s yours to discover.</p><p>But it’s safe to say it’s a fittingly unnerving celebration of ten years of these  unnerving games, deliberately indulgent, and packed with fun callbacks to the series. It’s going to be fun to discover if it’s ever considered canon, but since Mr. Rabbit has been haunting the Lake in his altogether more unpleasant form since 1894, we have to assume that his magic act took place before he arrived in the Hotel, so pre-1893.</p><figure id="" data-id="c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-recommend-id="image://c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2541" data-height="1430" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-recommend-id="image://c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2541" data-height="1430" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s so fun here is <em>Magic Show</em> allows the developers to let their usual sly winks come to the forefront, break the frame a little, and make sure you know that they know that you know they’re playing you. In fact, despite ostensibly having finished it, I’m still plugging away at a few remaining—extremely difficult—puzzles, to try to find every Easter egg hidden within.</p><p>And, at the same time, there’s also a new short film—<em>The Intern—</em>to complement the new game! It’s 10 minutes long, and has the developers wonderfully spoofing themselves as an intern tries to publish <em>Mr. Rabbit</em>, but discovers the Rusty Lake office is as much of a series of weird puzzles as the games they make.</p><p>If you want to get started with the <em>Rusty Lake</em> games, there’s no better place to begin than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-collection.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-collection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cube Escape </em>Collection</a></span>.

The latter is something quite extraordinary—a two part game that’s emboldened by a live-action short film. You can also watch that film for free via Steam, or indeed on YouTube, immediately below.</p><p>Of those premium games, not all have “Rusty Lake” in the name. So make sure not to miss <em>The White Door</em> (an incredible  story of a man trapped in an asylum), <em>Underground Blossom</em> (the most recent full game, entirely set on a train platform), and 2022's <em>The Past Within</em>, a co-op puzzle game set in the <em>Rusty Lake</em> universe in which each player sees a completely different version of the game, requiring you to coordinate to solve its puzzles. (And don’t forget the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281800/Samsara_Room/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281800/Samsara_Room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remastered <em>Samsara Room</em></a></span>, a game originally released in 2013 before <em>Rusty Lake</em>, but very much in the same universe.) They’re all on Steam and mobile, and personally, I prefer to play them as mobile games, ideally on a good-sized tablet.</p><p>I have so much fondness for this series, and am constantly impressed by the lengths to which the Dutch developers have gone to innovate within their deranged little world. I love how chilling it can feel, despite being a cartoonish series filled with tongue-in-cheek goriness. I love that every time I see a Corrupted Soul, no matter how much they appear in every game, I get the shivers. I also love how many questions I have, and how much I don’t want them answered. Congrats on ten years, Rusty Lake, now please make me many more games.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In advance of the Switch 2's planned June launch, Nintendo has <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current">released a system update</a> for the original Switch that, among other things, activates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">the company's new Virtual Game Card system</a> for sharing digital downloads. But Switch owners are finding that this new sharing system is a bit more limiting when it comes to sharing a single digital purchase for online play across multiple consoles.</p>
<p>For those who missed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">Nintendo's March announcement of the Virtual Game Card system</a>, the new setup allows players to easily "unload" a digital game license from one Switch (or Switch 2) console and "load" it onto another console connected to the same Nintendo Account (or <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28815/~/what-is-a-nintendo-account-family-group%3F">one in the same family group</a>). An Internet connection is required for the initial loading and unloading process, but after that, the system with the Virtual Game Card can play the downloaded game completely offline.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to constantly load and unload their virtual games between systems, Nintendo also offers an "Online License" feature deep in the Switch's system menu. When this feature is turned on, if you load a digital game without a Virtual Game Card present, the Switch will perform an online check to confirm that your Nintendo Account actually has access to that game. Nintendo recommends this feature for players who want to share games across three or more Switch units.</p>
<h2>Forget the old ways</h2>
<p>Both the Virtual Game Cards and the Online License feature represent a significant change from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/how-do-you-manage-software-and-saves-on-a-second-switch-its-complicated/">Nintendo's previous system</a> for managing digital games across multiple Switch units. Under that now-defunct setup, any number of users on a Switch designated as the "primary" console could play digital games without the need for an online check-in. Only users on any number of "secondary" consoles would need online access to confirm ownership when a game was launched.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>While that old system could be cumbersome to set up, it actually allowed for quite a bit of flexibility when it came to game sharing. As Nintendo noted on its official FAQ <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems">as recently as last week</a>, two users could play a single digital game purchase <em>at the same time</em>, as long as the Nintendo Account that purchased the game was playing on the secondary console (with an active Internet connection).</p>
<p>But Nintendo's FAQ explanation for "how to play the same digital game at the same time with different Nintendo accounts" has been removed from <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems">the current version of Nintendo's Switch digital game sharing FAQ</a>. In its place is a link to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">a new page detailing the Virtual Game Card system</a>. While the new FAQ also discusses the Online License feature for sharing games "even if you don't have a virtual game card loaded," there is no longer any discussion of how to access a single digital game on two consoles <em>simultaneously</em>.</p>
<p>Ars' own testing confirms that trying to load a digital game while another Switch is actively playing <em>the same game</em> results in <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41190">a "play is being suspended" error</a> on one console. This seems to be true even if one console has a loaded Virtual Game Card for the game being played and even if the consoles use different Nintendo Accounts from the same family group.</p>
<p>Players can simultaneously play <em>different</em> games from the same digital library on two different Switch systems, but only if at least one of those games is on a loaded Virtual Game Card.</p>

<h2>A partial workaround</h2>
<p>Players who want to play a single digital game purchased across multiple Switch consoles simultaneously can still use a partial workaround. A Switch console with a Virtual Game Card currently loaded should be set to Airplane mode (or have Wi-Fi disabled), and the user's Online License feature should be enabled for the game's original purchaser. The first system will still be able to play that Virtual Game Card offline, while the Online License feature will allow the same game to be played at the same time on a second system.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The major drawback of this workaround, of course, is that one Switch has to be completely offline for it to work. That means two players wanting to share a single digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for an online race won't be able to do so, for instance. It also means <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/mario-kart-8-deluxes-new-expansion-is-good-so-far-but-is-it-worth-25/">certain DLC tied to a Switch Online subscription</a> won't be loadable on the offline system.</p>

<p>In a way, it's a bit surprising that Nintendo took this long to close what can be seen as a convenient loophole in its digital game sharing system. After all, players who buy a single copy of a physical game can't simultaneously play that game on two separate consoles. The fact that Switch owners <em>could</em> do that with digital games until now was something of an officially acknowledged bonus for players who opted for downloadable games.</p>
<p>With the impending launch of the Switch 2, though, Nintendo seems intent on making sure that each player owns their own copy of a game when playing together online (with the minor exception of the few games that use <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/?srsltid=AfmBOoph7oDqGjKTQ_gWuqNAdKkI1O49rvPlVKC_K6kYQrupbFaYmHaZ">Nintendo's GameShare system</a>). As Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/will-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-become-gamings-new-normal/">starts asking $80 for a single copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, that closed loophole could end up being costly for some multi-Switch households.</p>
