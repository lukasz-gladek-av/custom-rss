			<p>The new Oblivion Remastered patch released <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-reduce-stutters/">earlier this week</a> brings some performance improvements over the previous version of the game, but the game is still very far from being in an optimal state, as even hgih-end hardware struggles running the game at high native resolutions without Frame Generation.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by MxBenchmarkPC compares the 1.2 version of the game with the launch version, highlighting how the performance improvements promised in the patch notes are indeed noticeable, but the overall situation is still not optimal. In a GPU-limited scenario on an RTX 5080, with NVIDIA DLSS in quality mode, ultra settings, and no Frame Generation, one of the most powerful GPUs on the market struggles to hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, and the 70 FPS mark at 1440p resolution, but even in a CPU-limited scenario, performance is far from being optimal, given the hardware. Things don't fare any better at native resolution, as the game runs at barely above 30 FPS at native 4K resolution, and in the 40s FPS range with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode. To hit anything past the 60 FPS mark, Oblivion Remastered needs Frame Generation, which is baffling, considering the GPU the game is running on, but sadly not surprising, considering the remake of the fourth entry in the series is most definitely not the only game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that doesn't run well on PC.</p>

<p>After being rumored to be in the works for a while, Oblivion Remastered was finally revealed and launched this April. Although the shift in atmosphere may be difficult to ignore for some players, and the performance leaves a lot to be desired, the new version of the classic RPG by Bethesda is one worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>

Prior to Nintendo, Takahashi worked at Sega and Square Enix on franchises such as Sonic and Final Fantasy. Motokura, meanwhile, directed Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive">confirmed to IGN last month</a> that Bananza was being worked on by the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, without detailing exactly who. But now we know who the game's top developers are — and we even know <em>why </em>the game exists, as IGN was told the idea came from Odyssey producer and Nintendo legend Yoshiaki Koizumi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's the part that now has fans wondering. If <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">Donkey Kong Bananza exists because Koizumi asked the Mario Odyssey team to make a 3D Donkey Kong game</a> but Koizumi isn't involved in his usual spot as either director or producer, then... well, what else could Koizumi be making?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Nintendo's most prolific creators, Koizumi has worked on every major Mario 3D platformer the company has made, acting as assistant director on Super Mario 64, director of Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, then producer of Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Mario 3D Land, Super Mario World and Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Koizumi also took on a major role around the launch of Nintendo Switch, acting as general producer for the hardware itself, and appearing as a regular face in Nintendo Direct broadcasts. Now, fans believe Koizumi's absence is a sign he's being saved up for something else: the next big 3D Mario.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/cjwxadk-1752228835804.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo veteran Yoshiaki Koizumi.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that Koizumi (produced Galaxy 2, 3D Land, 3D World, and Odyssey) isn’t working on Bananza is proof enough that there’s a separate 3D Mario in development and that Bananza isn’t supposed to take Mario’s spot," wrote fan BiggieNephew in a <a href="https://x.com/BiggieNephew/status/1943321530487771474" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on X / Twitter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you think then Yoshiaki Koizumi is producing the next 3D Mario?" another fan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"YOSHIAKI KOIZUMI ISN'T THE PRODUCER NOR THE DIRECTOR OF BANANZA!" wrote a third fan, all in caps. "NEW 3D MARIO GAME FOR SWITCH 2 IS SAVED FOR NEXT YEAR, WAHOO! WE BOTH MARIO AND DK FANS CAN COEXIST TOGETHER HAPPILY AT THE START OF THIS NEW ERA OF NINTENDO! (I Hope...)" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the arrival of another 3D Mario game at some point is assured, and none of this speculation appears to be taking away from the fact that Donkey Kong Bananza looks set to be Nintendo's next big and very promising-looking new 3D platformer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the absence of a new 3D Mario around the Switch 2's launch, and an increasingly lengthy wait for a new 3D Mario — since Odyssey's launch back in 2017 — has inevitably sparked speculation, and a hope that, alongside the upcoming delights of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo's next Mario outing is still not too far away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Donkey Kong Bananza details revealed by IGN this week include the fact <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-nintendo-switch-1-game">the game started life on Nintendo Switch 1</a>, as well as fresh chatter from Nintendo on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-leads-say-the-reason-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-is-for-the-player-to-puzzle-out">how Bananza fits into Donkey Kong canon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s increasingly messy saga has taken another dramatic turn. Developer Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders have announced legal action against Krafton after the publisher shared a statement accusing the former employees of 'abandoning' the underwater survival sequel.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.
</p>
<p>
Fan pushback was swift, especially given Krafton's talk of "metrics and targets" and the suggestion it might be cracking the whip to get the game complete "as soon as possible". And the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026. It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>.

<p>
Responding to Bloomberg's report, Krafton insisted the delay was "not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations" but was instead merely to improve the game following feedback. This directly contradicted an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">earlier statement made by Cleveland to fans</a> following his departure, claiming Subnautica 2 was "ready for early access". But Krafton didn't stop there; first it posted a new gameplay trailer, presumably in a bid to try and quell the growing community discontent, then, overnight, it issued another statement, this one far less diplomatic than the rest, directly accusing Cleveland and co. of "abandoning [their] responsibilities".
</p>
<p>
"Subnautica 2 was originally planned for early access launch in early 2024," it wrote, "but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game director and technical director respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project."
</p>
<p>
All this, Krafton insisted, resulted in "repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule", leading to what it called an early access version that "falls short in terms of content volume". It added it was "deeply disappointed in the former leadership's conduct", who it accused of failing to "honour the trust placed in them by our fans". It also claimed that 90 percent of the $250m payout highlighted in Bloomberg's earlier report would have gone to Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill.

<p>
But it seems the gloves are now well and truly off, with Cleveland responding to Krafton's statement with an announcement of legal action. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">post to the Subnautica community</a>, he described the ongoing saga as an "explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community", reiterating that "we know in our souls that the game is ready for early access."
</p>
<p>
"We've now filed a lawsuit against Krafton," Cleveland continued. "The details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life's work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it."
</p>
<p>
"As for the earnout," he continued, "the idea that Max, Ted, and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue. I'm in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we've always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we'll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands."
</p>
<p>
And that's where things currently stand. Assuming it doesn't get caught in the legal crossfire, Subnautica 2 is still expected to launch into early access sometime in 2026, and was previously anticipated to remain there for two to three years.

<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/masahiro-sakurai-commemorates-kirby-air-rides-22nd-anniversary-and-10-years-since-satoru-iwatas-passing/">Automaton</a>, Sakurai states that Kirby Air Riders is "shaping up to be something great" as he celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on GameCube. While it's hardly the most detailed update imaginable, it will still no doubt fuel excitement for those looking forward to Air Riders' upcoming release.</p>
<p>Sakurai also recognised the 10th anniversary of Iwata's death, and pondered on how he would soon be the same age as Iwata at the time of his passing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today was the release date of the GameCube's Kirby Air Ride. 22nd anniversary!!</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also the anniversary of Iwata-san's passing. 2015.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed since then…<br>
Iwata-san and I were about ten years apart in age and when we joined the company, and soon I'll be catching up to his age, won't I?</p>
<p>Right now, I'm pouring my heart into making Kirby Air Riders.<br>
It's shaping up to be something great!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirby Air Riders was announced as part of the Switch 2 Direct back in April this year. No further information has been shared, but it's scheduled to launch at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>In what would be one of his final YouTube videos, Sakurai also paid tribute to Iwata in a 'Grab Bag' special, during which he recounted several memories of the legendary Nintendo executive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is reportedly launching next year, but it may not feature the experience offered by the original in its entirety.</p>



<p>In a recent video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> reported to have talked with two unnamed sources who have connections with Halo series developers. Both have reported that the remake of the first entry in the series will be released to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary next year. The remake, whose development reportedly began in 2023, however, may only feature the single-player campaign, as both sources have heard nothing about multiplayer. Nothing has been said if the yet-to-be-announced remake will also launch on consoles other than Xbox Series X and S, but if it indeed is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">unrevealed project discovered last month by dataminers</a>, there's the chance it will also mark the series debut on PlayStation 5, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War Reloaded</a> is marking the debut of another of Xbox's tentpole franchises on Sony's console next month.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the Halo Combat Evolved remake, Rebs Gaming also provided an update on Project Ekur, the rebranded battle royale project originally in development as part of Halo Infinite's multiplayer offerings, which was reportedly given to Certain Affinity. While the state of the project is unknown at the moment, known Halo series dataminer grunt.api recently teased some news by posting a new ID code for the game, which was confirmed to be for the project and that is seeing consistent updates in the past few days, indicating that work is continuing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although the Halo Combat Evolved remake has yet to be announced, it will not take long to learn if the project is indeed real, as Halo Studios will reveal what's next for the series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">HaloWC 2025</a>, which is taking place in October 2025. Hopefully, we will better understand how the future will shape up for the series that has represented Xbox the most since Microsoft entered the console market after the teased reveals.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publishers Krafton have accused three recently ousted leads of "abandoning" their duties on the game, suggesting that this is to blame for it being delayed. That statement was almost immediately followed by one of the former Unknown Worlds bosses, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, writing in a Reddit post that a lawsuit's been filed by the trio against the company.</p>
<p>These are the latest twists in an ongoing saga that began with Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis being parachuted in to replace Cleveland, fellow co-founder Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">earlier this month</a>. That kicked off a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">war of words</a> between the two sides, punctuated by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">report from Bloomberg</a> which alleged Krafton's call to delay the game was made just before a $250 million bonus was set to be paid to Unknown Worlds staff.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Krafton claimed in <a href="https://krafton.com/en/">a statement</a> published late yesterday that "approximately 90%" of this bonus, tied to the dev team hitting revenue targets, was set to paid to the three ousted leads "with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2".</p>
<p>"However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them," they continued, "Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed." The publishers allege that "multiple requests" for Cleveland and McGuire to resume their responsibilities as game director and technical director were declined by the leads.</p>
<p>"Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule," the statement adds, with the publishers writing that they're "committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees" working on the game. "We reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised," Krafton added, not quite explicitly stating that the remaining devs will definitely get the full $250 million.</p>
<p>So yeah, very much both barrels being pointed at the exiled leads. Enter Charlie Cleveland providing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">an update</a> via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> subreddit.</p>
<p>"We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story," he wrote after reiterating his claim that the game was ready for early access, "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</p>
<p>"As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue. I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well."</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is a saga that looks very much set to rumble on for the foreseeable, as part of what Cleveland summed up as "an explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community". We'll keep you updated.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing]]></content:encoded>

While the focus of the event was primarily on the gameplay and story, there's something special coming for fans of the game. Now, Sony has unveiled the first look at the Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition PlayStation 5 bundles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpy0vfXXnd8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tpy0vfXXnd8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two options for fans: Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and Ghost of Yotei Black Limited Edition Bundle. The Black model will be exclusively available through PlayStation's official store, while the Gold model will be sold everywhere else. Both bundles include a disc drive, a matching DualSense controller, and a digital copy of Ghost of Yoeti with all preorder bonuses.</p><p>The dev team at Sucker Punch designed both limited editions, and noted that the Gold bundle was inspired by the Japanese art form known as kintsugi, which is used to repair broken objects with gold and lacquer. The Black bundle's look was taken from another Japanese art form called Sumi-e, which puts black ink on paintings.</p><p>"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration," noted Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connell. "This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings. The towering Mount Yotei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs."</p><p>Fans who already have a PS5 slim or PS5 Pro will be able to purchase Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition console covers through PlayStation's store. The designs for the DualSense controller will also be available as a separate purchase.</p><p>Both of the limited editions, the console covers, and the controller designs will debut alongside Ghost of Yotei on October 2.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53beccc0d116e/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A major Switch ROM site – 'nsw2u' – has been seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, nsw2u was one of the better-known repositories of Switch ROMS, which allowed users with hacked Switch consoles to download first and third-party games at will; often before their official release dates. In other words, then, it's a website that Nintendo was probably keen to vaporise quicker than Thanos snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>The full message reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2323 issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia as part of a law enforcement operation and action by: Federal Bureau of Investigation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo has been very strict in recent years over piracy related to Switch software, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-has-seemingly-taken-possession-of-the-ryujinx-switch-emulator-website">taking possession of the Ryujinx emulator site</a> in 2024 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-is-handed-another-lawsuit-win-after-accused-switch-pirate-fails-to-plead">winning a legal case against the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>It's not clear at this stage what might happen with nsw2u in the long run, but we'd wager that the site probably won't be coming back online anytime soon.</p>

<p>Regarding the Switch 2, it became clear soon after launch that those utilising MiG carts would be banned from online services on the console. This <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">drew the attention of Brazil's consumer rights watchdog</a>, who filed a complaint with Nintendo arguing that the latter's policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for.</p>

			<p>The games industry is undergoing some radical changes, and the challenges it is facing are caused more by the dominance of Fortnite and other popular live service and forever games than subscription services like Xbox Games Pass, according to a well-known analyst.</p>



<p>Commenting on recent video game sales data, Circana (NPD) Executive Director and Video Games Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Mat Piscatella</a> mentioned how video game subscription spending in the United States reached an all-time high in May 2025 with $0.6 billion spent and achieving the third consecutive month of growth. The analyst speculates that the spending increase in subscription services could be related to inflation and general economic uncertainty, making users look for value, which a service like Xbox Game Pass definitely provides.</p>







<p>Replying to a user mentioning the narrative that subscription services are killing the video games industry, Mat Piscatella highlighted how top live service games like Fortnite are more of a threat to the industry than services like Xbox Game Pass. The top 10 live service games are sucking nearly half of all gaming hours from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems before any other game can even get a taste of their popularity, so much so that, in every presentation given, the analyst points out that the biggest competitor to any new game or service is Fortnite. Compared to what the Epic Games' title, Minecraft and Roblox are doing, nothing else really matters.</p>







<p>This isn't the first time this week that we have heard how competing with games like Fortnite will become increasingly difficult. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-games-industry-is-facing-a-fundamental-realignment-june-2025/">A few days ago</a>, Square Enix's former Director of Business provided a rather in-depth analysis of the gaming industry's current state and how its transition to a social network of games phase is likely to shape its future.</p>

The PlayStation exclusive sold a whopping 2.4 million copies in its first three days on sale, with the most recent figures claiming lifetime sales of 13 million. Both a critical and financial success, obviously developers Sucker Punch immediately began work on a sequel, and some five years later we’re finally getting a good, long, detailed look at what the stealthy action-adventure follow-up has to offer.</p><figure id="" data-id="a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-recommend-id="image://a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1236" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-recommend-id="image://a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1236" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, this isn’t picking up where <em>Tsushima</em> left off. <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is a standalone sequel, set 329 years later, in 1603. This is an entirely new story, in a game all about revenge, main character Atsu returning 16 years after her whole family was murdered to kill the so-called Yōtei Six. And to really drive this home, the game will let you switch the world around you to Atsu’s childhood to contrast her before and after realities.</p><p>Once again, combat can be approached as you prefer, whether that’s melee sword battles, or ninja-like stealthy assassinations, or of course any mix of the two. And that sense of choice is, they claim, endemic throughout the game. As an open-world, the new footage explains you can mainline the central story, let yourself disappear off on extensive side-quests, or just explore the ridiculously pretty realm. However, the emphasis presented here is to take it slowly, no rush, “enjoy the ride.” And with those scenes of Atsu charging on horseback through the grasslands, seeds flying up around her, that does look like a rather lovely idea.</p><p>I really liked the extended trailer’s stressing that this isn’t a game about “honor,” about respecting the ancient traditions of this or that, but about a furious mercenary, willing to use dirty tricks and a shitty attitude to reach her goals. </p><p>Atsu will have access to a huge arsenal of slicey-choppy weapons, including a katana, spear, ōdachi (very long samurai sword), kusarigama (a brutal “chain-sickle”), and dual swords. And you can use these for broad third-person combat against crowds of foes, or sneaking up and silently taking people out. (If you’re playing this sort of game properly, that invariably means starting with the latter, then switching to the former when it all goes wrong.) And then there are bows and guns too, for ranged onslaughts. There’s also a bunch of rock, paper, scissors to it, as enemies switch weapons meaning you need to change up your response too.</p><figure id="" data-id="5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-recommend-id="image://5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-recommend-id="image://5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a whole bunch of bounties you take on, both plot-critical and side-quests, for which you’ll discover clues to track people down.

This is extended in <em>Yōtei </em>with the claimed “Miike Mode” to mean the camera is closer up in combat, with more mud and blood, and “Watanabe Mode” which will replace the game’s music with “lo-fi beats.” I mean, pretending that this is “partnering” with famous directors seems very silly to me, but I’m down for an ambient chill mode, as hilariously incongruous as it looked in the footage.</p><p>The game releases October 2, and damn, yeah, after this I’m very in.

            <p>A popular Nintendo Switch piracy site has been seized by the FBI, as Nintendo continues its crackdown against piracy.</p>
<p>Nsw2u was a repository for Switch ROMs online, meaning players could download games without purchasing them to play on a hacked console or PC emulator. Now, as reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site has been taken down in accordance with a seizure warrant from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>
<p>Dutch agency the FIOD, which investigates financial crimes in the Netherlands, was also involved.</p>
<p>The site has been on the EU's piracy watchlist since May of this year, so was blocked by ISPs in several EU countries, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/eu-piracy-watchlist-adds-ipfs-fitgirl-and-njalla-250523/">TorrentFreak</a> reported. Now, when attempting to view the site, a notice reads: "This website has been seized".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo to clarify its role in seizing the piracy site.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo updated its policy against piracy</a> with a severe warning against "unauthorised use" that could result in consoles being bricked.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company has been heavily cracking down on piracy in recent years. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">won a legal battle against a French file-sharing company</a> it described as "significant... for the entire games industry".</p>

            <p>Former RPS sealife correspondent Nate once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">described the game Maneater</a> as "an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark", which stuck with me. The Jaws Effect is a reasonably well known phenomenon <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275954344_The_Jaws_Effect_How_movie_narratives_are_used_to_influence_policy_responses_to_shark_bites_in_Western_Australia">coined in a paper</a> that explores the impact the 1975 film had on Australian policy response to shark bites, although the term is now used a bit more broadly to refer to how sharks are villainised in pop culture - villainisation obviously being an absurdly human and dramatic concept to apply to a hungry or scared fish.</p>
<p>Jaws <a href="https://jeevoka.com/jaws-is-responsible-for-killing-a-colossal-amount-of-sharks/s">did actually result in an increase in shark culls</a>, but its lasting legacy has also been argued to be more insididous. Depending on whether you're looking at stats from the UN or from conservation charities, the number of sharks killed or mutilated and harvested each year for fins and other parts ranges between about 10 and 100 million, and it's been <a href="https://sharkstewards.org/how-jaws-influenced-shark-perception/">argued this continues</a> with relatively little pushback as compared to similar wildlife atrocities due to wide-reaching perception that ranges from apathy to vilification. A sharknado of lies, if you will.</p>

<p>It's a sort of reverse Finding Nemo effect - not the discredited idea that everyone rushed out and bought clownfish after seeing it, but the one that worker Sarah Wynn Williams writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People">in her book on Meta</a>, where a UN colleague in conversation tells her the Pixar films were the "single most impactful thing to actually protect the oceans over the last decade”. This is obviously a bit proverbial but the basic point that fictional media does stuff wot is also sometimes real should pretty much be a given by this point anyway.</p>
<p>All of which is the sort of shit that goes rushing through my head before I can get around to writing "lol look at the funny shark game". Even though, sure, the shark game <em>does</em> look funny. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shark-dentist">Shark Dentist</a> is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_Dentist">Crocodile Dentist </a>but with ray tracing and convincingly grimy teeth barnacles, set in an office that looks like the room from the first Saw film. The idea is you go poking around in a sedated shark's gumline and then act all shocked when it chomps your ears off.</p>
<p>Shark, quite famously, do not need the dentist because they're diligent flossers, and also because they replace their teeth frequently. This is fine. If this shark dentist was real they would be too stupid to live anyway, because they don't seem to have considered it might be prudent to bind the shark's jaws before getting in there with a buzzsaw. Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3423280/Shark_Dentist">Steam</a> features:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Intense Gameplay:</strong> Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Roguelike Mechanics:</strong> Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Tool Interaction:</strong> Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Organic Balance:</strong> Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's for "lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw", which reminds me I never asked Nate about his feelings on The Meg combining two of his great loves - sealife and Jason Statham. I'll report back. Shark Dentist's release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shark-dentist-is-about-operating-on-a-fools-idea-of-a-shark]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's time to get totally radical, dudefolks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the latest nostalgia-fest about avian athletes artfully acing acrobatic boardiness, drops in full today, July 11th. Though, thanks to pre-order early access meaning the game sort of released three days ago, its modding community is already off and running.</p>
<p>If you've spent the past few months watching old X Games reruns and thinking to yourself that all the shreddage might be better if Bob Burnqvist were an Edwardian nanny, a train chaser, or a gabagool enthusiast, I've got some good news.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a glance at what THPS 3+4's Nexus Mods page has to offer as of this fine Friday, the answer is an awful lot of character skins swaps from modder Huckleberrypie, who's got a long and illustrious history of sticking different models into games. Here's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/barbieandthe12dancingprincesses/mods/3">Terry Honk</a> as the main character of Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses, a video game I had no idea existed until this morning.</p>
<p>They've clearly been working hard throughout these few early access days. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/11">Tommy Angelo</a> from the Mafia games, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/10">Tony Soprano</a> from the mafia game that was also a TV show, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/5">Snow White</a> from the Dwarven mafia, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/4">Elsa</a> from Frozen, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/3">the obligatory CJ</a> from GTA San Andreas - they're all here, swapped in for the Birdman and Brazilian prodigy Rayssa Leal while modders work out how to pull off standalone character additions.</p>
<p>For some reason, though, I can't take my eyes off one particular Huckleberrypie creation. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/12">Mary Poppins</a> from the 2018 film Mary Poppins Returns, which I haven't seen, but assume involves Mary Poppins coming back to force everyone to remember how to spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p>

<p>Along with the above video of Mary shredding the supercalifuck out of a park run, the modder's penned a backstory to explain her journey to skating superstardom. "Years after the events of the first film, Mary Poppins comes to the Bankses' aid when Michael's wife passed away and his family fell in dire straits due to the depression," it reads, "Mary clearly needed a break from all the turmoil her charges went through, and so she turned to her hobby of performing rock music and tearing up the park with her trusty skateboard."
</p>
<p>I don't care if it's the exact same narrative Huckleberrypie weaved for one of their multiple <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater1and2/mods/102">THPS 1+2 Mary Popins mods</a>, it's moving stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other mods on offer for 3+4 on release include a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/1">port of a 1+2 mod</a> that adds the likes of custom restarts and a free roam cam. Plus, there's the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/2">quick startup</a> for folks who can't stand three seconds of logo splashes. Oh, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/7">Master Chief</a> skating on a mini-tank.</p>
<p>Do you think Mary would have hit the 900 before Tony Hawk in real life, if she weren't a fictional character? I do, and if you disagree, you're just wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-drops-in-full-today-so-of-course-a-modder-already-has-mary-poppins-poppin-kickflips]]></content:encoded>

Each one is based on a real racehorse, with the personalities, designs and stats of each character reflecting their IRL counterparts. With the 2021 free-to-play mobile game finally getting its English-language debut this June on Steam, more international fans have been discovering the charms of Umamusume’s characters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/image007-1752223496532.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has enjoyed a successful launch in the west via Steam.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pink-haired Haru Urara seems to have struck a particular chord with some players. To say she has a bubbly, positive, can-do attitude would be an understatement. Even though she often loses races, she is good friends with the other horse-girls and often buys them souvenirs. Like Umamusume’s other characters, plucky Haru Urara is based on the real life horse of the same name, who is now 29-years-old and enjoying her retirement at <a href="https://www.matha-farm.com/%E9%A6%AC%E3%81%AE%E7%B4%B9%E4%BB%8B/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matha Farm</u></a> in Japan’s Chiba Prefecture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone loves an underdog, or an underhorse in this case. Haru Urara raced from 1998 to 2004, however she didn’t win a single one of her 113 races. Although she made it to second and third place a handful of times, she spent most of her career literally lagging behind (source: <a href="https://www.jbis.jp/horse/0000307965/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JBIS Search</u></a>). So much so that she became famous for losing, becoming a kind of national symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/gettyimages-154598960-1752223029427.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yutaka Take riding Haru Urara in 2004.

Even the betting slips with her name on were being used as charms to ward against traffic accidents (the word “<em>ataranai</em>” or “didn’t win” stamped on losing betting slips is a homonym for not being hit, by a car for example). In 2018, Haru Urara became a local celebrity again when she was featured on Chiba police’s traffic safety posters, getting paid 600kg worth of carrots (source: <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20180822-RPWWJE7OAVJCFL6YLXXVVS6TIQ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sankei News</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to July 2025, and users posting real life Haru Urara content on X noticed a sudden uptick of likes and follows, likely the Umamusume effect in action. X user animal_love_kaz, a self-confessed fan of retired racehorses who frequently posts photos and updates noted that their Haru Urara birthday post suddenly got thousands more likes overnight, with their overseas account gaining 400 new followers. In a <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1940610702202511743" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>July 3 post, below,</u></a> featuring a photo of the horse with a flower on her head that has since racked up 2.6 million views, animal_love_kaz wrote: "I don’t know if this will reach my overseas bros and sisters but Haru Urara is very well, in fact, she’s probably healthier and more energetic than me!"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">なぜかウララさんの今年の誕生日の時のティアラのが昨日からまた更に1万くらいイイネが増えてて通知止まらんし海外アカで昨日から400人くらいフォロワー増えてるじゃん<br>海外ニキネキ達に伝わるかわからないけど、ハルウララさんはとても元気で過ごしてるし、むしろ私より健康で元気なくらいだよ😆👍 <a href="https://t.co/E9MKbUaPRj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/E9MKbUaPRj</a></p>— もつご (@animal_love_kaz) <a href="https://twitter.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1940610702202511743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume’s Haru Urara has even been co-opted into the “Why don’t you ever give up?” “Because she never did!” meme, which is now floating around a social media comment thread near you (here it is on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tamanpermainan/comments/1lpuun7/the_horse_that_inspires_people_to_never_give_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a>).

Although Haru Urara was not successful as a racehorse, she is now gaining popularity on social media, and living out her retirement years with her friend Pepper the goat.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-leaked-document-allegedly-shows-why-krafton-delayed-the-game.1241244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The delay of Subnautica 2 has sparked into somewhat of a controversy between developer Unknown Worlds and parent company KRAFTON. Let's take a minute to recap what happened, chronologically:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally meant to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-is-getting-a-new-game-by-june-2025-says-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by June 2025</a>, but that clearly didn't happen</li>



<li>Earlier this month, KRAFTON <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced</a> the Unknown Worlds studio leadership (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) with industry veteran Steve Papoutsis</li>



<li>This week, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that KRAFTON had delayed Subnautica 2 to 2026. They also added that this would cause Unknown Worlds to lose a $250 million bonus linked to reaching a certain amount of revenue by the end of the year.</li>



<li>The delay was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>. However, KRAFTON claimed that it was not at all influenced by financial or contractual considerations.</li>



<li>Shortly afterward, the Korean publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked</a> the former leadership directly, stating that they had abandoned their responsibilities and caused the game to slip. For example, they said Charlie Cleveland focused on a personal film project of his instead of working on the game. </li>



<li>The studio leads would have allegedly received 90% of that $250 million bonus.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, some Reddit user has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an internal KRAFTON document that shows exactly why the publisher didn't want the game to launch. In the current state, Subnautica 2 lacked the 'level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion.' The document also adds that content was removed from the original plan for the early access launch, such as two biomes, one type of Leviathan, certain creatures, several tools, about six hours of narrative content, and even the character customization feature. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Basically, KRAFTON highlighted that the current version of Subnautica 2 wouldn't make users happy, thus the need for the delay to add more content and polish before making the game available to the public.</p>



<p>The former Unknown Worlds executives aren't taking those accusations lying down, though. A few hours ago, Charlie Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Reddit community</a> that he and the other execs are filing a lawsuit against KRAFTON:</p>



<p><em>We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</em></p>



<p>Cleveland also denied that the $250 million bonus would have gone almost entirely to them. He said that they had always shared profits with the team and this would not have been different. </p>



<p>Needless to say, KRAFTON is likely to respond in kind to the lawsuit. We'll keep you apprised of any further updates.</p>

            <p>Tides Of Torment, the next DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, has been pushed back from its original Summer release window to later in the year, with September onwards sounding the likeliest from a<a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75"> new blog post</a>.</p>
<p>And that's…honestly where the bad news ends, as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the blog is filled with some exciting and pretty respectable thoughts about future updates. Even the reason for Tides Of Torment's delay ("the short answer was no", it didn't hit the team's standards) strikes me as a good sign, since it means the DLC team at least feel they've got the breathing room to not rush out something they're not happy with. It's too nice outside for my PC to be running the kind of temps 1000 angry sea elves are going to result in, anyway.</p>
<p>Ah, yes: Sea Elves are confirmed now, led by Sea Lord Aislinn. Expect more details from a new video in August, by the sound of it.</p>

<p>There's siege improvements coming to the Proving Ground beta branch later this month. If you asked Sigvald, he'd surely sound sceptical sieges can be salvaged from their shabby state and shone to the standard seen in superior <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy games</a>, but since Sofia have…already released some clever updates, I'm feeling <em>mildly optimistic</em> about whatever they've got planned here.</p>
<p>In August, Lizardmen and Tomb Kings are getting some quality of life shinies and updated starting traits, and generic Greenskin characters are getting some skill line buffs. And then…</p>
<blockquote><p>"On the topic of the road ahead, we also want to acknowledge the growing conversation we see about the game's future beyond Tides of Torment. We’ve seen a few folk asking for specific characters that might not fit in any of our current DLC formats, so we are exploring how we might introduce a smaller style of DLC that brings a single LL, or Hero Unit alongside a few favoured additions. We’re working out how these would fit with our schedules, but we have a good idea for who the first one could be, and she’s someone near and dear to your blood."</p></blockquote>
<p>That last bit is very likely a hint toward Vampire lord Neferata, but I'm more interested in what this might mean for future expansions. The blog later drops hints for a teaser for an announcement of a promise at CA's 25th anniversary bash in December for "one of the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> content packs ever created in the trilogy", which might have a few of you huffing the Clan Skurvy grog fumes if you've kept up with things. </p>
<p>One of the more credible lines of speculation I've seen is that this is some sort of End Times pack, marking the winding down of the trilogy in favour of Total Warty Thousand, itself expected to be announced as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">multiple new Total War games CA have hinted at</a>. But single lord or other smaller DLCs sound like a great way to extend the life of Warhammer 3 without requiring the resources of the bigger expansions. Also, Rich Aldridge said he likes Halfling Soup Tanks in a video once. Just saying. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-gets-the-best-bad-news-yet-about-future-updates]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-producer-talks-turn-based-combat-viability-final-fantasy-xvi-learnings-and-more.1241223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy producer, director, and designer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Anime News Network</a> at last week's Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, California. One of the first questions was about the viability of turn-based combat for future installments in the series. It was Yoshida himself who infamously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that, as the visuals get more realistic, it is increasingly challenging for some gamers to stomach turn-based combat without feeling a dissonance. That's one of the reasons Final Fantasy XVI went with action combat only, angering some fans in the process.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which does feature turn-based combat (albeit spiced up with real time elements), did Yoshida change his mind? Not quite, based on his answer, though he did not exclude the possibility that the next Final Fantasy might have turn-based combat.</p>



<p><em>With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system. That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based. I'm not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida was chosen as the producer of Final Fantasy XVI after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-naoki-yoshida-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his excellent work as director of Final Fantasy XIV</a>. What did he learn during the development of the single player game?</p>



<p><em>There's a lot, but if I were to pick one, we were able to learn how to produce a high-end video game. There were a lot of learning points through that, and I feel like we gleaned a lot of know-how through the process. I want to challenge myself or apply to future works on how we can swiftly produce something of high quality and minimize the development period without lowering the quality.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida then said that he and his Final Fantasy XIV already have plans up to version 10.0 (the game is currently at version 7.0 with the Dawntrail expansion). Lastly, he expressed the desire to make a new online game based on a brand-new intellectual property at some point, and he added he doesn't feel anywhere near his retirement (he's currently 52).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The fallout from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/krafton-replaces-subnautica-2-studio-co-founders-effective-immediately/">Krafton’s firing of Unknown Worlds founders and execs</a> last week and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-just-a-week-after-krafton-fired-studio-co-founders/">the delay of Subnautica 2</a> has already been pretty wild and messy, but the publisher has now rolled up its sleeves and stepped down into the mud wrestling pits to try and restore its reputation and honour in this situation. In response, studio founder Charlie Cleveland has announced a lawsuit against Krafton.</p>
<p>In a statement posted as a pop-up on the Krafton website – in and of itself a pretty wild way to deliver such a message – Krafton accuses studio founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire of effectively abandoning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2’s</a> development to focus on other projects – including <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">an independent movie by Cleveland with a podcast and… uh… AI-generated movie posters</a> – despite repeated requests by Krafton for them to return to work. With the game originally expected to reach Early Access in early 2024, it’s already significantly delayed, and Krafton claim that it is significantly lacking in content for even this stage.</p>


<p>Additionally, Krafton states that 90% of the $250 million payout would have been reserved for studio executives Cleveland, McGuire and former CEO Ted Gill. Importantly, Krafton now state that for the rest of the Unknown Worlds team, they “reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.”</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltmkisws4c2w">Per Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, the purchase agreement would mean there’s $25 million to be divided between roughly 40 employees from a team of 100. It’s also still tied to revenue targets.</p>
<p>Making such strong accusations is very significant, because it opens Krafton up to libel and defamation lawsuits. Given the strong community pushback at the publisher, it’s clear they felt they had no choice but to air some dirty laundry.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">Charlie Cleveland’s rebuttal</a> states that they “know in our souls that the game is ready for Early Access”, echoing his statement from last week, and denies that they would have taken 90% of the $250 million bonus for themselves, stating that “Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well.”</p>
<p>Most significantly, he announces that they are suing Krafton: “We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public – you all deserve the full story.”</p>
<p>It’s all an abject mess, and will leave gamers unsure of who to believe. The Subnautica subreddit, for example, seems to still be wholly backing the studio founders, while there’s more doubt in more general gaming subreddits, especially with Cleveland’s movie projects coming to light.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember is the the vast majority of the work and the employees are unchanged by this ugly spat. For their sake, maybe it’s best to take a step back and wait for more information to surface before making a conclusion. Sure, remove a wishlisting for the game if you want, but also be open to this project still being good and developed by those with the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Here is Krafton’s full statement:</p>
<p><em>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</em></p>
<h3><em><strong>Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</strong></em></h3>
<p><em>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Background of Leadership Change&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</em></p>
<p><em>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</em></p>
<p><em>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</em></p>
<p><em>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume. We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</em></p>
<p><em>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</strong></em></p>
<p>And Charlie Cleveland’s rebuttal</p>
<p><em>Hello everyone,</em></p>
<p><em>It continues to be an explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community. None of this is what we wanted. But we truly appreciate the amazing support we’ve gotten from everyone. It means a lot to us, especially now.</em></p>
<p><em>As I wrote last week, we know in our souls that the game is ready for Early Access – that’s just how we roll. And we’d like nothing more than for you to play it (game devs <strong>live</strong> for this). But it’s not currently under our control.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public – you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue. I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Stay tuned.</em></p>
<p><em>-Charlie</em></p>

<p>It's also on the way to the Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/azure-striker-gunvolt-trilogy-enhanced-announced-for-switch">Azure Gunvolt Trilogy Enhanced</a></strong> getting confirmed for a worldwide release yesterday, Inti Creates has now lifted the lid on its 30th anniversary project <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/majogami">Majogami</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong> and is described as a new paper craft "2D action experience". You can see the official premiere in the video above, and below this is some PR to go with it.</p>
<p>The game stars a young woman named Shiroha who must cut through the horrors of a bizarre world after her father is turned into paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paper craft character action. Majogami stars Shiroha, a young woman who has lost her memory, who travels alongside Shiori, her father who has been turned to paper. With her katana, "Kamikiri", in hand, she travels through a bizarre world and cuts through the horrors she finds there in this 2D character action platformer.</p>
<p>Players take control of Shiroha who can move and attack instantly with her "Setsuna" ability, taking out enemies without missing a beat.</p>
<p>Along her journey, Shiroha will collect cards imbued with her memories called Recarte, and face off against the diverse Majogami, divine "Craft Witches" who control the world. These Majogami, with twisted hearts and powerful magic, stand in Shiroha's way as she tries to escape their domain. In addition to her Setsuna attack, she can rely on Shiori's defense sigils and the power of the guardians she meets, the Astrals, to transform herself into new fighting forms.<br>
By defeating these Majogami, Shiroha can slowly regain her memories of both her and Shiori's life, deepening their bonds and revealing her story.</p>
<p>Experience the touching family story and see Shiroha's determination to make it through this twisted world to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title will be available digitally on the Switch 2 for <strong>$39.99 USD</strong> (or the regional equivalent), or you can grab it on the Switch for <strong>$34.99</strong>. A physical release has also been confirmed for Japan. Here's a look at the box art design:</p>
