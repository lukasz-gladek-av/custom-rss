                <p dir="ltr">Most of what happens within the video games we play is invisible to us. Even the elements we're looking straight at work because of what's happening behind the scenes. If you've ever watched a behind-the-scenes video about game development, you might've seen these versions of flat, gray game worlds filled with lines and icons pointing every which way, with multiple grids and layers. These are the visual representations of all the systems that make the game work.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519553-assassins-creed-shadows-lanterns.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519553" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519553-assassins-creed-shadows-lanterns.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519553"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519553-assassins-creed-shadows-lanterns.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is an especially weird dichotomy to consider when it comes to lighting in any game with a 3D perspective, but especially so in high-fidelity games. We don't see light so much as we see everything it touches; it's invisible, but it gives us most of our information about game worlds. And it's a lot more complex than "turn on lamp, room light up." Reflection, absorption, diffusion, subsurface scattering--the movement of light is a complex thing that has been explored by physicists in the real world for literally centuries, and will likely be studied for centuries more. In the middle of all of that are game designers, applying the science of light to video games in practical ways, balanced with the limitations of even today's powerful GPUs, just to show all us nerds a good time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've wondered why many games seem to be like static amusement parks waiting for you to interact with a few specific things, lighting is often the reason. But it's also the reason more and more game worlds look vibrant and lifelike. Game developers have gotten good at simulating static lighting, but making it move is harder. Dynamic lighting has long been computationally expensive, potentially tanking game performance, and we're finally starting to see that change.</p><p dir="ltr">Case in point is Assassin's Creed Shadows and Ubisoft Technical Architect Nicolas Lopez. Lopez spoke at the Game Developers' Conference this spring, and reading through his slide deck was fascinating, with the release of the video recording of the show only amplifying that. I reached out to  Ubisoft talked with Lopez via email about how technology like ray tracing is changing game lighting. For more on those aspects of video game visuals, check out our primer on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-says-real-time-path-tracing-is-on-the-horizon-but-what-is-it/1100-6502837/" data-ref-id="1100-6502837">path tracing, ray tracing, and rasterization in game graphics</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj5pYktC3X8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yj5pYktC3X8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The thing that initially piqued my interest was a specific set of numbers Lopez put on the screen during the GDC presentation. Lopez noted that if lighting were calculated in Assassin's Creed Shadows the same way it had been in Assassin's Creed Unity, Shadows would've taken nearly two years to "bake" all the lighting--that is, precalculate and render it--and around 2TB of storage space to store all of that lighting. (Assassin's Creed Shadows requires 115GB on PC for the entire game.) Those numbers seem to represent a vast difference between the games of yesteryear and modern triple-A titles. I wanted to put those numbers into context as soon as I saw them.</p><p dir="ltr">Cities in Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate, Lopez explained, were pretty small spaces: dense cities about four square kilometers in area. In those games, developers used uniform lighting probes to dictate how global illumination was rendered (alongside other lighting techniques). Lighting probes are points on the map that contain information about what lighting is passing through the empty space in that area, which is then used to help light the static and dynamic objects in that space. These were 50-centimeter probes, meaning they were requesting light information every half a meter across Unity's entire city of Paris.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's pause for a moment to discuss global illumination, also referred to as GI. This is a broad term used to describe a variety of techniques meant to imitate and mimic realistic lighting, especially indirect lighting. These include cube maps, screen-space reflections, probe lighting, and more. Digital Foundry has a great primer on global illumination that breaks this stuff down into chunks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEkryaaAsBU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yEkryaaAsBU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The small scale [of these smaller game worlds] let us afford high-quality lighting, even though it required significant storage," Lopez told me. From Assassin's Creed Origins forward, though, world size exploded, and suddenly we were exploring worlds 256 square kilometers in area. That much baked light information would've caused games to explode in file storage size, so the team began to use a dynamic system.</p><p dir="ltr">"We vary probe density based on scene complexity--dense urban areas still use 50-centimeter spacing, but in open landscapes like deserts or forests, we reduce the resolution," Lopez explained. Artists paint this "GI density map" directly--meaning they can focus the quality of light where it matters most--which Lopez said "dramatically reduces data size while preserving visual quality where it matters most."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519551-bakedgi-uniform-resolution-acu-resolution-lowers-with-distance.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519551" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519551-bakedgi-uniform-resolution-acu-resolution-lowers-with-distance.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519551"></a><figcaption>Uniform light probe distribution in Assassin's Creed Unity.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519551-bakedgi-uniform-resolution-acu-resolution-lowers-with-distance.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Assassin's Creed Unity had a limited number of times of day--just four, compared to 11 in Shadows--and had very limited weather effects, while Shadows has a dynamic weather system. All those elements in Shadows create changes in lighting the game has to take into account to present believable visuals.</p><p dir="ltr">That original question--why would baking the lighting take so long and require so much file storage?--comes back to a simple conclusion. The limitations of hardware and game engines at the time forced the team to pre-bake a lot of lighting information; neither the hardware nor the software was ready to handle calculating so much light data in real time.</p><p dir="ltr">Historically, most if not all game lighting has been "baked." That means that the various techniques used to light a given scene are calculated ahead of time and then stored as textures and maps that the engine overlays onto the basic scene, so your computer or game console doesn't have to do those calculations while you're playing and slow the game to a crawl. This works for really static games and can provide very convincing, impactful lighting. As a game becomes more dynamic, though, baked lighting becomes less viable. If we consider cube maps (see our primer and that Digital Foundry video above for the specifics), you'd have to calculate a cube map for every possible place a character could stand, and that's where game install sizes can start ballooning when it comes to game lighting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519552-bakedgi-non-uniform-resolution-acsh-resolution-painted-by-artists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519552" data-ratio="0.63420427553444" data-width="1263" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519552-bakedgi-non-uniform-resolution-acsh-resolution-painted-by-artists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519552"></a><figcaption>Light probe distribution as determined by artists in Assassin's Creed Shadows.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519552-bakedgi-non-uniform-resolution-acsh-resolution-painted-by-artists.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unity's game world was a small, uniform space when compared to the more recent Assassin's Creed games. The same approach applied to the much larger areas of Shadows, with more dynamic effects and varied density, would've made for a truly massive game.</p><p dir="ltr">But it has been a long time since the release of Assassin's Creed Unity. More than a decade, in fact, and in that game, a lot has changed! One of the biggest changes has been ray tracing, which is available to all PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S gamers, and about 30-40% of graphics cards shown in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" rel="nofollow ">Steam Hardware Survey</a> as of this May.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ray tracing has had a major impact on how we approach lighting, from both a creative and production standpoint," Lopez said. "In traditional pipelines, lighting was mostly baked global illumination, reflections, ambient occlusion, etc. That meant lighting couldn’t react to world changes. Change or move a piece of architecture? Suddenly the lighting is invalid. Teams would have to re-bake the lighting data, which could take hours or even days. At Ubisoft, we ran overnight compute jobs so artists could get fresh lighting each morning. But it still slowed down iteration dramatically."</p><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing freed artists from many of those constraints, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Artists can move objects, adjust scenes, or iterate without waiting for long bakes. And since lighting is computed per pixel, the visual fidelity is much higher and more physically accurate," Lopez explained. In other words, artists can do art at their own pace instead of waiting for computers to compute before they do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Even so, ray tracing is often invisible to us on the consumer side of things, especially when we consider how static many game worlds can be. In those games, ray tracing is all but invisible, as it's doing the same thing that game designers were doing with creatively placed static lights. A Call of Duty level, for example, doesn't have to account for procedural changes to time of day and weather, so traditional lighting can be very effective.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4519554-pbr-night-rendering-lighting-only.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519554" data-ratio="0.81682242990654" data-width="1070" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4519554-pbr-night-rendering-lighting-only.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519554"></a><figcaption>Night rendering with light only in Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4519554-pbr-night-rendering-lighting-only.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The benefits can be subtle," Lopez admitted, with respect to that set of game-design rules. Shadows, Lopez said, is a truly dynamic world, and that makes ray tracing a genuine game changer--in a figurative and literal sense. Shadows has, as previously mentioned, 11 different times of day, four seasons, a variety of dynamic weather effects, and destructible environments that all affect the way players see the game as they play. The hybrid solution Shadows uses, combining some baked and some dynamic lighting, "pushed baked GI to its absolute limits."</p><p dir="ltr">"Ray tracing allows us to light these dynamic environments accurately and consistently," Lopez explained. "Lighting behaves as it should, even when the world changes drastically. No hacks, no workarounds. It makes the world feel more grounded and believable."</p><p dir="ltr">"Interiors light up naturally when doors open," Lopez continued. "Destructible objects finally contribute to the scene lighting. Season lighting changes the mood of a scene. Without ray tracing, these effects can only be approximated to a certain extent."</p><p dir="ltr">The team iterated on Ubisoft's Anvil engine, which is used across the Assassin's Creed series, in other ways. They adopted the Academy Color Encoding System, for example, which is a universal color standard used by the film industry to keep the work of hundreds or thousands of people consistent across many devices. It helps ensure that people working on different machines, in different locations, creating different parts of the game in a variety of applications, are working with the same color information. That gives us a more consistent and more grounded game--that is, the characters, buildings, foliage, and even effects look like they belong in the same game and feel convincing--at the end of development. Color Look-Up Tables (LUTs) allow the team to shift the visual tone and color grading to match the weather and environmental ambiance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519556-assassins-creed-shadows-shadows.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519556" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519556-assassins-creed-shadows-shadows.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519556"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519556-assassins-creed-shadows-shadows.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the key parts of getting Shadows right in particular fell, again, to getting the lighting just right. With HDR screens being so ubiquitous these days, developers can rely on having some ability to show a greater range of light and dark--but dark can still often mean pitch black. Even high-quality displays are subject to a user's personal preference, the qualities of that particular display, and a game console's ability to display color accurately. This became especially important when Ubisoft decided to finally fulfill years of gamers wishing for a ninja-focused Assassin's Creed game.</p><p dir="ltr">"We reworked key parts of our physically based rendering and exposure pipelines to behave more accurately in low-light conditions," Lopez said.</p><p dir="ltr">With ray tracing helping to inform the way lighting works in Shadows, the team can "deliver nights that feel moody and authentic, without relying on artificial fill lighting," Lopez said. The quality of the lighting directly supports the gameplay, both giving it more weight and believability, and making it feel more cinematic.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these changes came together, Lopez said, to create a "unified, reactive visual where everything feels connected," with Shadows in particular having sparked a cycle of innovation that pushed Anvil and Assassin's Creed both forward.</p><p dir="ltr">For the rest of us, Assassin's Creed Shadows works as an example of how video game design is adapting to new technology for both gamers and game designers alike. Designers working on tentpole games like Shadows have new ways to create games more quickly without sacrificing fidelity. In return, we get more dynamic worlds that live and move around us.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credits: Ubisoft</em></p>

<p>This comes via a recently-posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMR-2k127U">2nd anniversary video on YouTube</a> in which the developer responded to a comment from our very own community member 'PikaPhantom', simply stating "we will be providing free Switch 2 upgrade soon!".</p>
<p>We're not sure exactly what this might entail, but chances are it'll probably boost the game up to a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>

<p>Dave the Diver has proven to be a massive hit with fans, and its success has led to many collaborations with other indie titles and even a few so-called "AAA" games, too.</p>
<p>In our review, we awarded it a score of 9/10 and said "It's one of the few games to come out this year that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". Definitely one to keep an eye on if you've not played it yet, then.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tjhsiv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

		<p>I hope you’re all ready for another hot weekend. Thankfully it’s starting off pretty nice and cool, but the Sun’s just about to start doing its thing and get the UK roasting. Not a weekend to be playing VR games, that’s for sure… Maybe go for a nice walk in Death Stranding 2?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> played “more Tainted Grail, 10 hours into Act 2 and still getting on great with it.”</li>
<li>And&nbsp;<strong>Andrewww</strong> got in some more Death Stranding via PS Plus. “What I don’t quite get just yet is that you have a bike, but the paths for some missions just seem impossible to drive, as the terrain seems too rocky to get through (getting to the port for the first time). And walking all that distance seems rather a drag. So, I’m still very early on, figuring out how to get around.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars, hiding from the sun, basking in it or whatever you have planned.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183377 @ 1751118156 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>With my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> P Switch journey complete, I'm excited to actually spend some time with the damn machine this weekend. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is still tickling me in a "I can't believe I'm actually playing this" kinda way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is... well, it's Wind Waker! <em>On the go</em>!</p>
<p>My big plan is to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> over the next couple of days, though. That DK Direct has left me with Power Moons on the mind, and crossing a few more off the seemingly never-ending list is my only course of action. What a game, eh?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still playing quite a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> at the moment, though I must say I’m quite tempted to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and check out the new additions to the game line-up.</p>
<p>I’ve been a bit manic with my Switch 2 games recently; jumping between a handful of them at frequent intervals out of an abundance of excitement. I’m conscious to just slow down for a little bit and focus on one thing at a time. Probably won’t happen, though.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. That's it. When I start it up, I'm physically unable to pull myself away for about two hours. It's a real problem, but the whole darn thing is just excellent all around. I'm going to hit the 100 hour mark on this loooong before the year is out...</p>
<p>Amazingly, I haven't actually tried out the GameCube NSO app yet, so I think a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> are on the docket for the weekend. But I can't leave my island alone for too long. I've got too many lives to level up.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Still making my way around TRON: Catalyst after some unexpected plot twists. But this week’s champion on the Switch eShop is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. Questionable choices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">generative AI usage</a> on the game’s fictional internet aside, this is one of the strongest entries in the whole franchise and while being a very “safe” remake, I quite welcome the upgraded PS1 visuals in glorious 16:9 screen ratio.</p><p>

On the Switch 2 front I got a few new bangers but am still too hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> and its latest free DLC update while carving my way into chapter 7 of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut. There was also a very nice update on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</a> that brings the new siege PVE game mode that will surely take a chunk of my weekend. Assuming I can safely ignore STEAM summer sales, that’s my weekend sorted.</p></div>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I'm off for holiday the next two weeks, so I'm planning on doing some serious damage to a few things, including my game collection. I'll be playing a whole lot of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a> on PS5, and the amazing <strong>Dune: The Awakening</strong> on PC, those are my main priorities, and if I don't do serious hours in them on my week off it's never happening. However, my beautiful Switch 2 is also gonna be getting plenty of action, fret not</p>
<p>My sons and I will be continuing to hoover up everything in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but I'm also making my way very steadily through the new and improved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, which I rushed through first time out. It's got me wanting to 100% this time, though. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civ 7</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> are all on my holiday hit-list.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and catch you all after a quick two-week power nap. Take care, pals!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend... I'm on a plane! Again! But that means that perhaps it's time to catch up on my backlog. Or... time to do research for my own project! Which means that my options are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which I'm using as inspiration for a game I'm making to learn programming</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, which I know I'm going to love (as I've mentioned in at least one other WAYP)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, which I bought full price and then only played a couple of hours of</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, which I hear great things about</p>
<p>So many games! So little time. I haven't decided yet, which means I'll probably default to Fantasy Life... again...</p>

<h2>Fraser Gilbert, Pure Xbox Editor</h2>
<p>Hello from the world of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>! I haven't delved into the world of Switch 2 yet, but I'm excited about my latest purchase for the Switch 1 - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>! I managed to pick it up at a great price on Vinted, and as someone who tends to stay away from 2D Mario (but loves <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>), I'm curious to see how I get on it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (kinda addicted to the Koopathlon, not gonna lie), and I'm meaning to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a>. I had a great streak going on Ring Fit for weeks, but things got busy around the Xbox Showcase, and I ended up neglecting it. It's time to right that wrong!</p>

			<p>With Battlefield Labs continuing its testing phase with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more players</a> from various regions, new leaked videos of Battlefield 6 regularly appear on the Web. The latest one<span>, featuring a full match of Rush Mode from the Alpha, was posted yesterday on the Battlefield subreddit</span>.</p>
<p>So far, feedback from the test phase (and from these leaks) appears positive. Destruction is set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come back in a big way</a>, with the developers seeking to make it once again an integral part of the core Battlefield experience. Interestingly, destruction also causes rubble that remains on the map, creating new cover opportunities as the match goes on.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">Battlefield 6 Alpha leak - Rush Game Mode ( 27_06_2025 )</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant-Sky2969/">u/Brilliant-Sky2969</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Battlefield 6 would be revealed this Summer with a launch planned by April 2026. However, the new game was nowhere to be seen at Summer Game Fest 2025. There are two options left: either it's going to be featured during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 (airing on August 19, 2025, 8:00 PM local time) or Electronic Arts is preparing a dedicated event specifically for this unveiling.</p>
<p>Four development studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the new Battlefield installment: franchise creator DICE is spearheading the multiplayer experience, while Criterion is working on content across both single-player and multiplayer modes. Motive is leveraging its expertise in storytelling and action (they crafted the single player campaign for Star Wars Battlefront II and worked on the Dead Space remake, in addition to making Star Wars: Squadrons) to deliver an engaging campaign for players to explore, which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> to be inspired by the movie Civil War and the TV show Lioness. Finally, Ripple Effect is working on a new Battlefield experience "fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA". This could be some sort of variation on the extraction shooter/battle royale formula.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will have to compete against <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. We don't have the release date yet, but it's safe to say it will be between late October and early November, just like most Call of Duty games. The new Battlefield could launch later and try to capitalize on potential discontent from COD users.</p>

<p>The once-lost GBA chapter returns this Summer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another week of action-packed showcases and to top it off, WayFoward gave fans another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>A new trailer was shared during the 'IndiaMania 2025' showcase, with extended gameplay footage on display. It highlights how this modern version of the revived GBA project will include "more action, more environments, and more transformations" than before.</p>
<p>This "once-lost chapter" in the Shantae saga is scheduled to arrive in <strong>Summer 2025</strong> on the Switch and multiple other platforms. In some related news, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae">Shantae</a> title was recently made compatible with the Switch 2 thanks to a recent firmware system update.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Bandai Namco remastered the PlayStation Vita exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_wars_remastered">Freedom Wars</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to give this action RPG a go since then, there's now a demo available on Nintendo's eShop. The full game is also currently on sale in the US for <strong>$29.99 USD</strong> instead of $39.99 USD.</p>
<p>In our review, we said this game was a welcome addition to the Switch library - reviving one of the PS Vita's most unique and enjoyable games, even if there were a few setbacks in terms of story and performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Its core gameplay is challenging and satisfying in equal measure, with plenty of customisable options and upgrades to keep you hooked."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since launch, the development team has also rolled out some updates for the game to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/freedom-wars-remastered-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">improve the overall experience</a>.

<p>When the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lunar_remastered_collection">Lunar Remastered Collection</a> arrived on the Switch in April, it had a bit of a rocky physical launch.

<p>Now, though, this has changed with GungHo Online Entertainment America announcing the Althena's Treasure Box will be made available in the US and Europe as a "limited-edition" release. This special collector's boxset includes "one-of-a-kind" items based on Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tjhsiv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Drawn by Yoriyuki Ikegami, who has been working on the TGC since the Crown Zenith days, this Ivysaur is a beautifully drawn card featuring the Seed Pokémon in a forest, staring into the water and seeing its former self as a Bulbasaur staring into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a vibrant, colourful card with a bit of emotion under the surface. Plus, this is a solid card for gameplay as well. Its 100HP makes it a bit tanky for a Stage 1 card. While it’s three-Energy Vine Whip dealing 80 damage feels standard, Leech Seed being able to heal and pepper damage at the same time is a nice bonus. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9.

Alakazam ex - 201/165</h2></div><div catalogid="10253fac-98fb-4225-b3a0-8d6e29fef852" id="223541"><div id="223541" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam ex - 201/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first among the pricey ex cards of 151 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgj3E?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex</a>, who can quickly stack some serious damage, both by using its Mind Jack to take advantage of your opponent’s benched Pokemon, and Dimensional Hand to deal damage from your own Bench. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drawn by Shinya Komatsu, it wouldn’t be surprising if this Alakazam ex’s design is one of your favourites among 151 like it is mine. Set in the back of a home with potion bottles and books everywhere, testing its psychic abilities with those iconic spoons, it’s a thoughtfully done yet cosy sort of card that shows Komatsu understands Alakazam’s genius and drive to gain the edge in battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Squirtle - 170/165</h2></div><div catalogid="cac6fcfd-399f-4bf5-81aa-16cdfe3d67fb" id="223540"><div id="223540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squirtle - 170/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration rare of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgw7B?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Squirtle</a> is where 151 starts to get pricier, but it’s not hard to understand why when you look at its artwork and who illustrated it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Placing the Tiny Turtle Pokémon in the ocean water at the beach, this Squirtle was drawn by Mitsuhiro Arita, a veteran artist who has been working on Pokémon cards since the TCG’s very inception and has drawn almost 700 of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The risk of its Withdraw attack and the two-Energy cost of a 20-damage Skullbash doesn’t make it the best gameplay-wise. And yet, with the amount of jaw-dropping detail put into Squirtle and the ocean waters themselves, this can more be considered a work of art than a playing card.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Charmander - 168/165</h2></div><div catalogid="b440d385-5030-4d17-9b9e-27c615da2908" id="223539"><div id="223539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmander - 168/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we’ve reached Kanto’s Fire-type starter, it’s the illustration rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL82wM?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander</a> that turns out to be the most valuable among the original three, compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also illustrated by Miki Kudo, you can see its design is much like Charmeleon’s in a mountainous canyon, but this time at the bottom. The crowning touch for this theme is further down this list, but its duo Fire attacks, one dealing damage and another removing a troublesome Stadium card, this Charmander is a must for any Kanto-based Fire deck when its full evolution chain has been added. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Zapdos ex - 202/165</h2></div><div catalogid="d90cc191-aa00-4caa-900a-660bf81f4aac" id="223538"><div id="223538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zapdos ex - 202/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Conjured up by the artistic talents of Shiburingaru, who has been of part ot the Pokémon TCG since 2022’s Brilliant Stars, 151’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwOG3?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zapdos ex</a> is stunning, with a majestic illustration featuring the electric bird soaring through the sky with its fellow Legendaries, Moltres &amp; Articuno. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its ability and moveset are nothing to overlook either. Along with Voltaic Float giving it flexibility for an easy retreat, Zapdos’ Multishot Lightning attack gives it the capability to shred through your opponent’s benched Pokémon as well as those active. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Venusaur ex - 198/165</h2></div><div catalogid="9434fc56-5232-437f-b0a8-b70052fba801" id="223537"><div id="223537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Venusaur ex - 198/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A vivid and colourful card design, even more so than its pre-evolutions, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5LY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex</a> looks both peaceful and intimidatingly stoic at the same time. Another card by Yoriuki Ikegami, it’s fitting for the fully evolved Grass-type starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also like Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, it’s fairly tanky as well with 340HP, paired with it being able to steadily heal your team and inflict Poison plus Confusion to your enemies too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Blastoise ex - 200/165</h2></div><div catalogid="f195fc8d-ec53-4736-a93b-bcadc97a550e" id="223536"><div id="223536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blastoise ex - 200/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second most expensive card in 151 is this resplendent vibe of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJLA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex</a> card. Another by veteran Mitsuhiro Arita, there are multiple reasons this special underwater-themed card has drawn quite a high price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as its very pretty illustration facing the final Squirtle evolution underwater, it’s just as Venusaur ex, with the ability to deal more damage. While its HP isn’t as high, its Solid Shell reduces damage, while its Twin Cannon attack can deal up to 280 damage at a time at the cost of two Energy cards, even though you have to discard Energy cards each time you use it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Charizard ex - 199/165</h2></div><div catalogid="c67f18cf-0db2-4d1d-b6be-06f80faf129c" id="223535"><div id="223535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charizard ex - 199/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $173 in market price in writing, the 199 full-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR0dx?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex</a> is both the most expensive in the Pokémon TCG’s 151 set, but also the most exquisite in terms of design. The crowning jewel of Miki Kudo’s illustrations, this Charizard completes the trilogy: starting with Charmander at the bottom of the mountainous canyon, Charmeleon slightly higher up, and Charizard itself soaring above with a fiery volcano in the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, combined with the natural nostalgia for the practically priceless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/11/pokemon-just-hit-us-in-the-nostagia-with-updated-pokemon-base-set-cards"><u>Charizard from the base set</u></a>, is arguably why this is the most expensive card in 151 by over $100. Although its Brave Wing and Explosive Vortex attacks make it a strong damage-dealer, you might want to keep this one in a special case rather than a tournament deck if you manage to pull one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in other current sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-back-in-stock-amazon-new-updated-2025"><u>Prismatic Evolutions</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a>, and even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025"><u>upcoming Mega Evolution set</u></a>, 151 has plenty of rare holofoil cards that have driven up a high market price on sites like TCG Player. In this case, though, it’s all of the full-art holofoil editions of Kanto favourites, also known as “illustration rares”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

<p>A fusion of "belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last year, Arc System Works lifted the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a></strong>, but one thing missing at the time was a Nintendo version.</p>
<p>Now, during the company's latest showcase this week, a Switch version has been confirmed for release alongside other versions of the game on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This new entry will "revive" this classic beat 'em up series in a new form tailored to modern playstyles. It will also be leveraging Arc System Works' fighting game development experience to deliver a modern beat 'em up "that pursues an exhilarating gameplay feel".</p>
<p>Development producer Tatsunori Ishikawa says the team is pouring its "full effort into development" to ensure the latest entry in this 38-year-old series is released in fighting form.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's been confirmed if you pre-order the game, you'll receive the exclusive classic <strong>Double Dragon Dodgeball</strong>. Pre-orders are also available for this upcoming release in physical and digital form.</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR from Arc System Works official game page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Double Dragon Revive - The Fusion of belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
<p>"In Double Dragon Revive, players will find modern belt-scroll action and exhilarating gameplay. Both longtime fans and newcomers to the series will once again be able to experience the action-packed thrills of the Lee Brothers as they face off the powerful foes of their city!</p>
<p>"Players will find the beloved characters from the golden age of arcades recreated in modern 3D graphics with a unique style! Powerful foes from their past return to face off against the Lee brothers. <em>Double Dragon Revive</em> will feature familiar boss characters from earlier entries along with new bosses. Face the intimidating Shadow Warriors all in this brand new style!"</p>

With the recent release of Nintendo Switch 2, many players are jumping into the Nintendo Switch ecosystem for the first time, and there are dozens of amazing games waiting for them. There is no bigger Nintendo franchise than Super Mario, and the Nintendo Switch received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">many of the plumber's best entries to date</a>. Today, you can save on select Mario games like Super Mario Odyssey, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and more. It's not every day that Nintendo games go on sale, especially from the Super Mario series, so don't miss your chance to save with these limited summer deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Deals on Mario Games for the Switch Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury brought one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games/wii-u">best Wii U games</a> to Switch, and it's better than ever with a brand-new expansion. The base game has 12 different worlds to explore, with both local and online co-op available for up to four players. New to this version of the game is Bowser's Fury, an entirely unique experience that features 100 different Cat Shines to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at $41.99, Super Mario Odyssey is well worth the price of admission. It's still arguably the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-super-mario-games">best Mario game</a> to date, featuring a giant sandbox to explore, hundreds of collectibles, and an unbelievable soundtrack. For 3D platformer fans, Odyssey is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it's a game you can replay time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is another game that was given a second life on Nintendo Switch, having first released on Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/21/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-review">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a>.

This sequel to Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle improves on nearly everything from its predecessor, with all sorts of humor and chaotic battles awaiting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're buying for your Nintendo Switch console, the eShop will be your best bet. However, if you wish to purchase a key to either gift to a friend or redeem on your console, Humble Bundle has the same Mario games on sale for similar prices.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Steam Summer Sale Is Also Live Now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Nintendo's sale, Steam has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-summer-sale-best-pc-game-deals">also launched its annual summer sale</a> on PC games. If you're looking to find some discounts outside of Nintendo, this is one of the best times of the year to do so.

                <p>A really cool parkour game is being delisted from Steam on June 30, but you still have a chance to grab it for dirt cheap. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supermoves/" data-ref-id="5000-612689">Supermoves: World of Parkour</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959580/Supermoves_World_of_Parkour/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale right now for just $0.79</a> ahead of its removal next week.</p><p>Despite being a blast to play, Supermoves has had a bit of a tragic life following its release last year. Based on both critical and Steam review response, Supermoves is a blast, combining Mirror's Edge-inspired freerunning with some cool multiplayer modes. However, the game did not sell particularly well, and developer Makea Games was forced to shut down back in April.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a0SDDAIds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9a0SDDAIds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tomi Toikka, the founder and former CEO of Makea Games, stated that he has been in negotiations to try to retain control over the Supermoves IP, but to no avail. As he shared in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1959580?emclan=103582791474310960&amp;emgid=803443087671039373" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a final update</a> announcing the delisting, Makea's financing structure apparently prohibits any path for Toikka to keep the game on sale. He wrote, "After shutting down Makea Games, I had hoped I could salvage the game IP to be preserved in another game company, so players could still play the game they own online, and maybe it could see a resurgence in new players one day. But sometimes the cost of doing business is losing something you love."</p><p>As part of the process of removing the game from sale and the restrictions imposed by Makea's liquidation proceedings, Toikka is also shutting down all of Supermoves' multiplayer features. This means that the game can only be played offline, and while there is a single-player mode that will remain fully functional, much of the original game will be rendered unusable.</p><p>Being forced to essentially eliminate a large swath of his own game has, understandably, made Toikka frustrated and upset. "If you care about digital preservation, independent development, or public R&amp;D policy, I hope the fate of Supermoves sparks a wider conversation about how we keep creative work alive, even when the business behind it closes its doors," he wrote. "I'll cherish the time I spent working on the game with the greats at Makea Games forever. I just wish I could have played the game online with my future kids someday."</p><p>If you're interested in checking out the game, grab it as soon as possible, as it'll be gone for good on Monday, June 30. The base game goes for $0.79 right now, and the deluxe edition--which includes some cosmetics as well as a copy of the soundtrack--is available for $2.43.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here at Aftermath, we only pick winners, as evidenced by our decision to become the first video game website ever (to our knowledge) to <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorse a political candidate</a> in newly minted NYC Democratic mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani. The pick was a no-brainer: He speaks his mind, he wants to make the city cheaper, and he <a href="https://x.com/PanasonicDX4500/status/1937982130178691098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably knows who Sephiroth is</a>. But, contrary to popular belief, he’s not our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/new-york-city-might-get-its-first-gamer-mayor-years-before-winning-the-democratic-primary-11-year-old-zohran-mamdani-had-his-heart-set-on-simcity-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>first</em></a><em> </em>gamer mayor. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we relay some unfortunate facts.</p><p>This time around, we celebrate Mamdani’s win by bringing on a whopping TWO guests: First, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxrn.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Rivlin-Nadler</a> joins us to talk about how <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a> – a fellow worker-owned publication – punched well above its weight during this election, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/mayoralforum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizing a forum</a> that leading Democratic candidates (excluding Andrew Cuomo) showed up to and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFqqr2hmqZc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting an election night livestream</a> that aired in bars across the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Then former Kotaku writer turned professional <em>Genshin Impact</em> advocate turned laid off person (hire them!) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/six6jiang.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sisi Jiang</a> comes on to share their experience knocking on over 1,000 doors for the Mamdani campaign – part of a wider canvassing effort that resulted in an unprecedented turnout for a leftist candidate. Lastly, using the <a href="https://x.com/souljagoyteller/status/1937816227692597617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scant information available</a>, we attempt to divine what kind of gamer Mamdani is.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can get Mamdani on the show, or at least pester his people until they let us ask him who he mains in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Some people have been making the assertion that Zohran is going to be our gamer mayor, simply because of his age and because he knows what <em>FIFA </em>is. But I have really bad news: Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams, who did actually invest millions into gaming-related initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Those include a degree program in game making, regular student <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments that were about combatting climate change, and most recently the NYC Video Game Festival, which took place in May and kicked off the so-called “Summer Of Games,” which encompasses a bunch of events that have happened in previous years, but packages them all together as a New York City initiative. Regrettably, considering his many other sins, Eric Adams has been kinda good on this.</p><p><strong>Sisi:</strong> You know what? This is exactly what gamers deserve. We don’t deserve a good gamer mayor; we deserve Eric Adams, gamer mayor – the same mayor who said random shit like “All my haters are the waiters at my table of success.” That is the most gamer mayor behavior.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But I don’t think he knows games. If you tried to ask him Mario lore, he’d be like “Well, he’s the king of the Mushroom Kingdom.” He’d know enough culturally to lie about it, but it would all be just slightly off. [You’d have to tell him] “Mario’s not the king of the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s a different guy.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Even just the other day, he <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met up with Kai Cenat</a>, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch. When he entered the room, you can hear Eric Adams saying “I just want my video game,” and it’s like, did you think you were gonna get a video game out of meeting with a Twitch streamer? Are you making a joke? The context is not fully there, but it’s a very odd thing for him to say when walking to shake hands with Kai.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’d be funny if he knew who Kefka was, but he doesn’t know who Sephiroth is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

                <p>If you're craving some FPS gaming this summer, you'll want to check out Humble's latest bundle deal, the 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle. The deal lets you grab each mainline entry in the BioShock and Mafia series on PC for just $18. Like other Humble Bundle deals, the company donates a portion of proceeds to charity--in this case, the bundle supports Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, immediate crisis care, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. You can also adjust the revenue split between Humble, 2K, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle offers a tiered payment option, and the more you pay, the more games you get.</p><p dir="ltr">If you only want the Bioshock series, you can grab the base $10 tier that includes the Remastered Editions of BioShock 1 and 2, alongside the original BioShock Infinite. The enhanced editions of Bioshock 1 and 2 included in this bundle offer improved graphics and UI, with support for up to 4K resolutions. It's also worth noting that the version of Bioshock Infinite included in the bundle does not include the Season Pass DLC content, and must be purchased separately.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $18 or more, you'll also unlock the Definitive Edition versions of Mafia, Mafia II, and Mafia III. All three Definitive Editions feature upgraded graphics, as well as all story DLC and additional content from the original versions. Owning all three also unlocks bonus in-game costumes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700"></a><figcaption>Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While all six games in the bundle are first-person shooters, BioShock and Mafia offer very different gameplay experiences. The BioShock series is a more cramped, atmospheric series set in fantastical alternate-history worlds. The original BioShock was a huge hit when it first released, thanks to its solid gunplay, improvisational combat abilities, and unique, deep-sea steampunk setting of Rapture City. Bioshock 2 returns players to Rapture, and casts them as one of the first game's most intimidating enemies, the Big Daddy. BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater adventures of the previous two games and sends players to Columbia, an airborne city of miracles with dark secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia, on the other hand, are open-world crime thrillers, each of which takes place in a different historical era. The first Mafia game is set during the 1930s in Illinois, Mafia II spans the 1940s and 1950s in New York, and Mafia III takes place in Louisiana during the late 1960s.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle is available at Humble until July 9. All games purchased in the bundle are delivered as official Steam keys.</p><h2>2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle</h2><h3>Pay at least $10</h3><ul><li>BioShock Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock 2 Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock Infinite</li></ul><h3>Pay at least $18</h3><ul><li>BioShock Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock 2 Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock Infinite</li><li>Mafia Definitive Edition</li><li>Mafia 2 Definitive Edition</li><li>Mafia 3 Definitive Edition</li></ul><p>If you're looking for more PC game deals, Humble also has plenty of other bundles available right now.

It also includes some bug fixes, tweaks, and improvements, such as a change to how stamina is consumed while skateboarding.</p><p>The off-road skateboard is added to the inventory on sale at the Shred Shack, where it'll cost you $1,500. While minor in the grand scheme of things, it lets you live out your mountain-boarding dreams. If you're of a certain age, it might even let you reminisce about the mountain-board levels in Rocket Power: Beach Bandits for the PS2.</p><p>This patch also tweaks a couple of other skateboarding-related things. First, the developer notes that it implemented some minor changes for skateboard animations. Second, stamina consumption while on a skateboard has changed from instantaneous to gradual, which will likely smooth out the skateboarding experience.</p><p>Other bug fixes and changes include fixing instances where players could not knock on certain doors, reducing stamina consumption while pushing on a skateboard, and improving some pricing issues. You can read all of the changes in the patch notes below.</p><p>Developer TVGS has recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/" data-ref-id="1100-6532269">big content updates will be decided on the basis of player input</a>, and that a first major update is coming soon.</p><h3>Schedule I version 0.3.6f6</h3><h4>Additions</h4><ul><li>Added off-road skateboard</li></ul><h4>Tweaks/Improvements</h4><ul><li>Skateboard stamina consumption is now gradual rather than instant.Tweaked some IK constraints for skateboard animations.</li></ul><h4>Bug fixes</h4><ul><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the door of the tall brick building next to the overpass.</li><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the doors of the blue apartment building.</li><li>Fixed skateboard pushing consuming excessive stamina.</li><li>Fixed mis-indexed loading bays at the docks warehouse.</li><li>Fixed broken font at the French restaurant.</li><li>Fixed customers accepting unpackaged product, even when displayed success chance is 1%.</li><li>Fixed the packaging station Mk2 being slower to use for NPCs compared to Mk1.</li><li>Fixed Salvador coca seed pricing.</li><li>Fixed a networth calculation bug.</li><li>Fixed a random generation bug causing 'Aspen Death' to be a very common output.</li><li>Modified the pawn shop's pricing algorithm to be a bit less predictable.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the best perks of owning a Switch 2 is its exclusive <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">GameCube library</a> on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The service launched with three titles, and we’re getting our first new addition in the form of Super Mario Strikers next week.</p><p>Super Mario Strikers originally launched on GameCube in 2005 (making 2025 its 20th anniversary), and is an extreme soccer game starring the cast of the Mushroom Kingdom. The arcade-style sports title sees players executing over-the-top special shots and maneuvers, and features various game modes such as Grudge Match, Cup Battles, and Custom Battles. Like Mario Kart, players can use items such as shells and mushrooms to turn the tide of a match.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's worth noting that Strikers was one of the confirmed "coming soon" titles shown during the GameCube library announcement trailer. Other titles shown that are slated to arrive in the near future (by Switch Online standards) include Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chibi-Robo, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokémon Colosseum.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can play Super Mario Strikers when it arrives on July 3. It joins the already available The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX. You can view the full list of currently available games on the entire Nintendo Switch Online classic games service <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2024/04/24/nintendo-switch-online-every-nes-snes-game-boy-n64-sega-genesis-gba-and-gamecube">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/super-mario-strikers-is-the-next-gamecube-title-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online]]></content:encoded>
