You'll want to adjust some of the game settings to improve your aim and movement, and there's also an intelligent movement setting to help with Black Ops 7's new wall jump mechanic. This guide covers recommended settings for controllers, graphics, and audio settings in the Black Ops 7 menus.</p><p dir="ltr">Optimal settings are always going to be subjective, but here we detail our preferred options for console players on PS4/PS5 and Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S.</p><div data-embed-type="toc" data-hide="true"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">show</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_controller_settings">Best controller settings</a><ul><li><a href="#Inputs">Inputs</a></li><li><a href="#Controller">Controller</a></li><li><a href="#Deadzone">Deadzone</a></li><li><a href="#Aiming">Aiming</a></li><li><a href="#Aiming_advanced_settings">Aiming advanced settings</a></li><li><a href="#Aim_assist">Aim assist</a></li><li><a href="#Motion_sensor_aiming">Motion sensor aiming</a></li><li><a href="#Intelligent_movement">Intelligent movement</a></li><li><a href="#Movement_behaviors">Movement behaviors</a></li><li><a href="#Advanced_Movement_Settings">Advanced Movement Settings</a></li><li><a href="#Vehicle_Behaviors">Vehicle Behaviors</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_behaviors">Combat behaviors</a></li><li><a href="#Overlay_behaviors">Overlay behaviors</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_graphics_settings_for_console">Best graphics settings for console</a><ul><li><a href="#Display">Display</a></li><li><a href="#Quality">Quality</a></li><li><a href="#Details_and_textures">Details and textures</a></li><li><a href="#View">View</a></li><li><a href="#Field_of_View">Field of View</a></li><li><a href="#Camera">Camera</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_audio_settings">Best audio settings</a><ul><li><a href="#Volumes">Volumes</a></li><li><a href="#Global">Global</a></li><li><a href="#Functionality">Functionality</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_controller_settings">Best controller settings</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Inputs">Inputs</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Edit button layout: Default or tactical</li><li dir="ltr">Stick layout preset: Default</li><li dir="ltr">Horizontal stick sensitivity: 1.65 to 1.85</li><li dir="ltr">Vertical stick sensitivity: 1.65 to 1.85</li><li dir="ltr">Simplified controls preset: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Low motor strain preset: Off</li><li dir="ltr">L1 Button ping: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Swap L12/R1 with L2/R2: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Controller">Controller</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Controller Vibration: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Trigger effect: Off</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Whether you choose the default or tactical button layout might depend on the type of controller you use. Black Ops 7 expands on last year's omnimovement, bringing even faster and more fluid omnidirectional movement as well as the new ability to wall jump.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical layout is recommended for those using a standard controller, as it maps your crouch/slide/dive button to the thumbstick, so you can be quick without ever needing to move your thumb. If you have something like a Scuf or another brand of controller that lets you remap the buttons, you can just leave this on its default setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger Effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5. The immersion might feel cool, but for more precise aiming, you want to have this effect turned off.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deadzone">Deadzone</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578987-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578987" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578987-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578987"></a><figcaption>Deadzone testing in Black Ops 7</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578987-deadzones.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deadzone Inputs:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Min: 0.4</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">L2 Button: 0.0</li><li dir="ltr">R2 Button: 0.0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stick drift varies for each player's controller, so your settings here will likely look different to another player's. Thankfully, Call of Duty has a helpful feature for testing the deadzones on your controller, and it's found right here inside the settings.</p><p dir="ltr">First, start on the default Deadzone settings, then turn on the Test Stick Deadzone setting. This test will give you numbers on the bottom of the left and right stick images. Whatever numbers it gives you, you want to adjust the minimum stick drift number for that specific stick to go at least one number higher than the number you're given.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: If your left stick test shows a 3 and the right stick shows a 2, you want to adjust the minimum drift for the left stick to a 4 and the right stick to a 3. Then test again to make sure you don't have any more drift.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, you'll want L2/R2 set to 0.0 to make sure you're getting instant activation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578988-aiming.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578988" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578988-aiming.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578988"></a><figcaption>Settings for aiming</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578988-aiming.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Aiming">Aiming</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sensitivity Multiplier:  <ul><li dir="ltr">3rd person sensitivity multiplayer 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Ground vehicle sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Air vehicle sensitivity multiplier: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Tablet sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Sens.

Turning this on means that you can jump at the wall and the setting will perform the wall jump for you. You can also choose how the assisted jumps work by limiting it to only when you are facing a wall or only when a wall is on either side of you.</p><p dir="ltr">I think this can be a helpful setting for some players less savvy with movement and wanting assistance, but I probably wouldn't recommend it for players who like to jump shoot/bunny hop, as it can create some unintended jumps if you're too close to a wall.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Movement_behaviors">Movement behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Slide/Dive behavior: Slide</li><li dir="ltr">Automatic airborne mantle: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Sprint Restore: On</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Sprint restore: On</li><li dir="ltr">Slide maintains sprint: On</li><li dir="ltr">Wingsuit activation: Manual</li><li dir="ltr">Wall jump activation: Press</li><li dir="ltr">Slide/active roll behavior Tap to slide</li><li dir="ltr">Active roll camera: 1st person (3rd person looks weird)</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Advanced_Movement_Settings">Advanced Movement Settings</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sprint/Tactical sprint behavior: Toggle</li><li dir="ltr">Auto move forward: Single tap</li><li dir="ltr">Auto door peek: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Grounded mantle: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Tactical sprint activation: Single tap sprint</li><li dir="ltr">Plunging underwater: Trigger</li><li dir="ltr">Sprinting door bash: On</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Vehicle_Behaviors">Vehicle Behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Vehicle control mode: Driver control</li><li dir="ltr">Scorestreak vehicle control mode: Aim-based control</li><li dir="ltr">Vehicle camera recenter: Short delay</li><li dir="ltr">Camera initial position: Free look</li><li dir="ltr">Lean-Out activation: Melee</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578990-combatmovement.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578990" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578990-combatmovement.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578990"></a><figcaption>Combat behavior settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578990-combatmovement.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combat_behaviors">Combat behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Aim down sight behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount activation: ADS + melee</li><li dir="ltr">Dedicated melee weapon activation: Hold Melee</li><li dir="ltr">Body shield/finishing move animation: Prioritize finishing move</li><li dir="ltr">Armor plate behavior: Apply all</li><li dir="ltr">Quick C4 activation: All at once</li><li dir="ltr">Equipment behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Manual fire behavior: Press</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Advanced combat behaviors:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Focus behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Change up directional behavior: Ping</li><li dir="ltr">Change zoom activation: Sprint/Tactical Sprint/Focus</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount exit: Short Delay</li><li dir="ltr">Interact/reload behavior: Prioritize reload</li><li dir="ltr">Mantle cancels reload: On</li><li dir="ltr">Sprint cancels reload: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Akimbo behavior: Independent (This lets you fire each weapon individually)</li><li dir="ltr">ADS stick swap: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Depleted ammo weapon switch: On</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount movement: On</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount return: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Overlay_behaviors">Overlay behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Inventory control: Directional buttons</li><li dir="ltr">Ping wheel delay: Moderate</li><li dir="ltr">Double tap danger ping delay: Moderate</li><li dir="ltr">Emotes and sprays wheel position: Default</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_graphics_settings_for_console">Best graphics settings for console</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578995-quality.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578995" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578995-quality.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578995"></a><figcaption>Display quality settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578995-quality.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Display">Display</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">120 HZ refresh rate (If applicable): On</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Eco mode preset: Efficiency</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Quality">Quality</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">World motion blur: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon motion blur: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Depth of Field: Off</li><li dir="ltr">FIDELITYFZ CAS: On</li><li dir="ltr">FIDELITYFZ CAS Strength: Choose somewhere between 50 -

Personally, I like to greatly lower all the music and slightly lower the volume of everything except the effects volume.</p><p dir="ltr">The effects volume is going to include the game's precious footstep audio, so I'd never suggest turning that one down. You want to hear those footsteps at 100. Dialogue volume includes important announcer callouts about enemy scorestreaks and such, so you don't want this sound turned down too far either. I'd recommend not going lower than 80 here.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Global">Global</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Audio mix: Home Theater or Headphones Bass Boost</li><li dir="ltr">Mono audio: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Mute licensed music: On or off</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This setting is the hardest to list because it can be a lot of personal preference and dependent on what device you're using for audio. Home Theater or Headphones Bass Boost is a great option for audio quality.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're planning on streaming and/or uploading videos for Black Ops 7, you'll want to <strong>mute the licensed music</strong> so you don't get hit with copyright strikes.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Functionality">Functionality</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Reduce tinnitus sound: On/Off</li><li dir="ltr">Hitmarker sound effects: Default</li></ul><p dir="ltr">I personally like the Reduce Tinnitus Sound turned on to reduce the sometimes extreme sound of the flashbang and concussion grenade effects, but you should try what's best for you.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, adjusting these console settings should help you get the best aim, movement, audio, and visuals for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced plans for how Grand Theft Auto V will celebrate Halloween, and there is a lot of spooky content on tap.</p><p>To begin with, the Cayo Perico Survival and Ludendorff Cemetery Survival modes are back, but with a zombie twist for Halloween. Players will face off against "tides of zombies" in these locations, along with "hulking juggernauts, armored conquistadors, splitters, possessed animals and their trainers, zombie DJs, and more," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578978-screenshot2025-10-02at2.21.05%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578978" data-ratio="0.54885301614274" data-width="1177" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578978-screenshot2025-10-02at2.21.05%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578978"></a><figcaption>Halloween comes to GTA Online.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578978-screenshot2025-10-02at2.21.05%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The Cayo Perico Survival mode pays out double GTA$ and RP now through October 8, while the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival mode pays triple rewards October 23-November 5.</p><p>The GTA Online Halloween update also includes a variant of the Slasher mode. In this new twist, players battle it out in the tight confines of the Ramius submarine. In the Slasher mode, one person plays as the Slasher, armed with a shotgun and able to use a flashlight to get around. After a period of three minutes, the players being hunted are granted shotguns of their own to go after the Slasher. This mode will pay out double GTA$ and RP October 16-22. The standard versions of Slasher are back in October as well.</p><p>Additionally, Rockstar is adding a different Halloween-themed mode each week in October. Here is the schedule:</p><ul><li>October 2–8: Beast vs. Slasher</li><li>October 9–15: Judgement Day</li><li>October 16–22: Slasher (Ramius Submarine)</li><li>October 23–29: Condemned</li><li>October 30–November 5: Slasher (includes Ramius Submarine)</li></ul><p>What's more, Rockstar said fans can look forward to "plenty more off-kilter events" in GTA Online throughout October.

<p>Crawl through dungeons and learn Japanese in Shujinkou</p>
</section><section>

<p>2025 has been an absolutely stacked year for video games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> are just a few games that have picked up over a 90 average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/">OpenCritic</a>. But until Hades II arrived, there was a game that stood head and shoulders above the rest, and you might not have even heard of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> launched on PC via Steam and PS5 earlier this year and the Switch version is out <strong>today</strong> (2nd October) on the eShop for £26.99 / $29.99 (or your regional equivalent). The port was actually announced about a month ago, but given the craziness of September, it completely slipped by us!</p>
<p>Developed by Rice Games, a studio founded by Julian Rice, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawling RPG where you can also learn how to speak and write Japanese. Anyone with decent knowledge of Japanese might spot that the very game's title translates to 'Protagonist' and that the three main characters are all named Shu, Jin, and Kou.</p>
<p>But teaching you Japanese isn't the primary focus — while it is a part of the game, it's actually entirely optional, and Julian Rice has said in interviews that "It is not a Japanese language learning tool". This is first and foremost a video game inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/etrian_odyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the RPG side of things, then this rundown from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shujinkou-switch/">eShop</a> should help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Japanese is entirely optional. For those more interested in the adventure, Shujinkou delivers a rich role-playing experience:</p>
<p>• Explore challenging labyrinths and solve puzzles from a first-person perspective.<br>
• Engage in strategic turn-based battles that evolve over time.<br>
• Switch to “English-Only” mode at any time to focus solely on the gameplay experience.<br>
• Master hundreds of Arawasu skills and uncover powerful items.<br>
• Forge dozens of distinct weapons and armor, each with unique flavor text.<br>
• Fish for a wide variety of marine creatures at various scenic spots.<br>
• Complete 100 side quests that explore and expand upon the many inhabitants of Genya.<br>
• Play six minigames hosted by members of the Fuu Lobby.<br>
• Revisit your journey through the Art Gallery and Jukebox.</p>
<p>Having been in development for over six years, what truly sets Shujinkou apart is its additional, seamless integration of Japanese language learning. Whether you’re only here for the adventure or here to finally learn Japanese through a real video game, the ability to learn a challenging, real-world skill makes Shujinkou stand out in the already-crowded genre of amazing role-playing games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game is currently at a 94 on OpenCritic after 9 reviews, and a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/shujinkou/">90 on Metacritic</a> after 6 reviews. That's not many, <em>but</em> it is notable, as many of those reviews are pretty glowing.</p>
<p>"Shujinkou is a phenomenal game, easily making its way to the ranks of my favorite JRPGs,' says <a href="https://noisypixel.net/shujinkou-review-jrpg-learn-japanese/">Noisy Pixel</a> in its review. <a href="https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/02/review-shujinkou-sony-playstation-5.html?callback=in&amp;code=MMVJY2YXNGETODHLZC0ZMGI4LWE4MTGTMJI1ODJHNWEZNJNK&amp;state=b14c57950a9c4fd0a2d7245c8890cb76">Digitally Downloaded</a> was equally full of praise, saying "It’s an inspired, intelligent idea and I hope people give it a chance despite being as indie as they come." And, similarly, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/shujinkou/">RPGFan</a> calls the game "one of the most ambitious indie games I’ve ever played."</p>
<p>Obviously that's just a handful of opinions (there are a few lower-scores there) and over on Steam, it's only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386630/Shujinkou/">garnered 14 reviews</a>. But the fusion of mechanics alone has us interested. Shujinkou, we have our eyes on you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Enshittification Of Game Pass Is Here]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-enshittification-of-game-pass-is-here.1315117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some things happen slowly and then all at once. So it appears to be with Xbox Game Pass. Once hailed as the “best deal in gaming,” it’s now best known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059">the deal that just keeps getting worse</a>. A 50-percent price hike this week feels like a death knell, if not for Microsoft’s $5 billion annual subscription business, then at least for the perception that the company is trying to meaningfully compete by rewarding its long-time fans with something they can’t get anywhere else.</p> <p>It feels like the shift began way back in 2022. “We’ve held price on our console; we’ve held price on games and our subscription,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer said on stage at the <a href="https://techlive.wsj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Tech Live conference</a> that year. “I don’t think we’ll be able to do that forever. I do think at some point we’ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was really important that we maintain the prices we have.”</p>

 <p>After years of Game Pass boosterism, he was also noticeably cool on the subscription service’s long-term growth prospects. “Game Pass as an overall part of our content and services revenue is probably 15 percent,” he announced at the time. “I don’t think it gets bigger than that. I think the overall revenue grows so 15 percent of a bigger number, but we don’t have this future where I think 50–70 percent of our revenue comes from subscriptions.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “We’re seeing incredible growth on PC…on console, I’ve seen growth slow down, mainly because at some point you’ve reached everybody on console that wants to subscribe.”</p> <h2>Game Pass now costs more than Netflix</h2> <p>Three years later, with over $70 billion in acquisitions weighing on Microsoft’s gaming division, we’re seeing what that calculus means for the math on the ground. Microsoft has doubled the price of Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048">in the last two years</a>, in addition to tariff-fueled hikes on its consoles and briefly flirting with releasing its first $80 game this fall. Even as the company has touted Game Pass’ self-sustaining profitability, it’s also laid of hundreds of developers, closed studios, and canceled some of the biggest games it promised players at summer showcases past.</p>

 <p>To me, the most shocking part of Game Pass Ultimate’s jump to $30 a month wasn’t the price tag, even if it is more than every other mainstream content subscription service out there (you can currently get Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundled together for the same amount). It was how little Microsoft offered in return: <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, old <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, and <em>Fortnite</em> skins. These are the types of fine-print perks Verizon gives you for adding a new phone line, not the basis for a premium flagship subscription service.</p>

   <p>What the latest Game Pass overhaul is really about is extracting a premium from existing customers for day-one access to <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft tested the waters last fall with a $3 a month price hike ahead of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and, just as importantly, the removal of day-one access from Game Pass’ middle tier. Microsoft is now promising that all of its first-party day-one Game Pass games will come to Standard, which remains $15 a month, within the first year<span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->except <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>

 <p>That’s on console. The picture on PC is even more explicit. There, the service is going from $12 a month to $16.49 with no other changes. That’s almost a 40-percent increase in exchange for nothing except the ability to continue playing the new <em>Call of Duty</em> each year without paying for it. Microsoft apparently got tired of not being able to charge PC players for online multiplayer, which still costs $120 a year on Xbox.</p>

 <p>Microsoft hasn’t announced new Game Pass subscriber numbers in over a year, which strongly suggests that it hasn’t grown much beyond the 34 million number shared in early 2024. Having now hit the ceiling Spencer alluded to back in 2022 on PC as well as console, the company seems content to soak its remaining users for as much as it can. Instead of growing Game Pass revenue by growing the program, it will make the number go up by getting its highest rollers to spend even more time at the tables.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631109">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In this regard it’s taking its cues from Sony. Part of what has made the PS5 generation the “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-sony-borderlands-4-patch-performance-mgs4-2000629168">most successful ever</a>” is that the most dedicated PS5 players keep spending more and more. While PS5 sales are largely in line with the PS4 before it, fans are buying accessories and <em>Fortnite</em> skins, and staying subscribed to the most expensive version of PS Plus. With sky-high hardware prices and fewer exclusives than ever, Microsoft has clearly given up on growing its own share of the gamer pie. Instead it’s leveraging a massive publishing apparatus to try to squeeze its remaining users for even more cash.</p> <p>This makes it sound like there is cold, hard financial logic governing Microsoft’s strategy here. But while I concede the new Game Pass might look good in a spreadsheet, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">I have no idea who it’s actually for anymore</a>. At $360 a year you could buy <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> and still have almost enough left over to pay the Xbox online multiplayer tax. If you’re only in it for the service’s impressive parade of neat indie games, well, you could buy A LOT of indie games for that much. And if you are a daily <em>Fortnite</em> player, I mean, are you even playing anything else?</p>

 <h2>The ‘Play Anywhere” platform is pricing fans out</h2> <p>Perhaps this is just Microsoft’s way of teeing up a cheap, ad-supported tier sometime in 2026. Call it Game Pass Lite. “The big question going forward is if Game Pass can be a sustainable product off console and how best they can reach this audience,” Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973424993909211530">wrote on X</a>. “At the very least that’s going to require a lower entry cost (Essential) and experimentation with cloud only, ad supported, or mobile-first offerings.”</p> <p>In the meantime, the company seems content to price out large parts of its audience that stuck with it for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">waiting for Xbox to finally turn a corner</a>. This reflects a larger reality in the current market. The top 10 percent of income earners now account for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/top-10-of-earners-drive-a-growing-share-of-us-consumer-spending">nearly 50 percent</a> of consumer spending. “Everything is being priced for them while Xbox leaves everyone else behind,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m27xpbowkk2w">wrote</a> <em>Giant Bomb</em>‘s Jeff Grubb.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27ychwabs27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreib3b42zpkv6eiuq4to3475pktxeidlkcfzhd4lzmbbb2zqcrk3qcu"> <p lang="en">Been talking about this trend for years when it comes to games spending. Why are there premium gamepads, $149 collector's editions, Pro consoles and general rising prices?

The average spend on ‘other entertainment’ across all income levels was $653.” We don’t how those spending averages breakdown exclusively for games, but it suggests a similar picture: fewer people are accounting for a larger share of total spending on games, at least in the U.S.</p> <p>Others are seemingly rushing to ditch their Game Pass subscriptions before they auto-renew at the higher price.

Of course, OpenAI boss Sam Altman has allowed for his likeness to be used — so here he is having a lightsaber battle with Pikachu:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon don't sue me 🥲 Sora 2 is insane <a href="https://t.co/dInl6EysJl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dInl6EysJl</a></p>— Pm Prod (@PMProdResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PMProdResearch/status/1973542955832185143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Pokémon, Nintendo's own Mario characters have been getting plenty of use.

"In short, we don't have a definitive answer yet," business lawyer and creator of the Virtual Legality podcast Richard Hoeg told IGN today. "There are indications in some quarters that training on protected materials is likely going to be deemed legal so long as the materials themselves were acquired for some lawful purpose (and not pirated). But on the output side, the Disney/Dreamworks lawsuit makes some good arguments for why/how the law should expect these platforms to police prompts for infringing requests, especially if they are already policing for something else (porn, bigotry, etc.). But all of those are still just arguments, not settled law..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoeg continued: "The law moves slowly, far slower than technology, which is why you see these tech companies racing ahead of it a bit. My best guess is that OpenAI is probably going to be okay long term on the training sets they used (assuming they weren't pirated), and that the 'opt out of training' option therefore won't do much of anything. Where they really need to concern themselves is on the output side and/or if they are marketing their software's abilities with protected content themselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content," a spokesperson told IGN, "and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while The Pokémon Company may not begin legal action over that usage, the firm is still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit">keenly battling on against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a> in its claim that the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why">infringed upon multiple patents</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox has released the looter shooter’s first big balance update since it came out, and it makes a number of significant buffs across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Gearbox said its goal is to “always provide players with the tools and means to build their perfect Vault Hunter,” and it wants players to experiment and craft theories for builds by combining different gear, firmware, skills, and specialization trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, it’s focused on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon, the Vault Hunter considered by most to be weakest in the game, gets buffs that bring him closer to the other playable characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power were adjusted to make those builds more viable in the late endgame, Gearbox said. And Harlowe has a couple tweaks “to make sure Stasis is getting value for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox had said it would leave overpowered builds, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-youtuber-tries-to-nerf-proof-their-character-instead-stumbles-upon-what-is-almost-certainly-an-unintended-interaction-that-does-so-much-damage-it-causes-bosses-total-existence-failure">even those based on what it called "unintended interactions,”</a> alone for the time being to focus on buffs, and the studio has remained true to its word with today’s patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, expect those builds to fall by the wayside somewhat in the future, Gearbox warned. “Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity,” the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox continued: “We're excited about the future of Borderlands 4 and its upcoming Post-Launch Roadmap. This is just the start of an exciting year of updates and content, and we can't wait to experience it all with our community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting an additional improvement in the patch notes, below, which focuses not on balance but on performance. The update adds auto-clearing of Borderlands 4 stale shaders on version update, preventing performance degradation on some PCs. That will be welcome news to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-wait-15-minutes-for-shaders-to-compile-in-the-background-while-playing-after-reports-indicate-recent-update-causes-stuttering">Borderlands 4 PC players who found the last update caused stuttering</a>.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch notes are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 October 2 balance update patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Weekly Activities: </h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Weekly Big Encore Boss</strong> has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on. </li><li>The<strong> Weekly Wildcard Mission</strong> has changed.

<p>And it's coming to Switch this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Onion Games has shared the Western release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a>, a childlike RPG where a young boy is transported into the world of a retro RPG and encounters a world where only children live. And it's finally coming out in the West on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar, well, it should! Onion Games is the team behind the rerelease of the cult classic PS1 RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon</a>, which similarly transported your character inside the world of a video game.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the devs at Onion Games worked on the original 1997 release; the team is primarily made up of Yoshiro Kimura (director and game designer), Kurashima Kazuyuki (art director), and Hirofumi Taniguchi (composer), whose credits include <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/rule_of_rose">Rule of Rose</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/chulip">Chulip</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/little_kings_story">Little King's Story</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a>. That's an eclectic mix!</p>
<p>But Stray Children seems to be very much in the same vein as Moon, an oddball RPG which subverts genre tropes. Moon is probably most famous for inspiring Toby Fox and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> nowadays, and you can see those elements even clearer here.</p>
<p>Instead of battling enemies outright, you can choose to whisper in the ear of the Olders — described as "monstrous adults carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and the many other grievances that all grown-ups gather." Oh geez, way to call us out, Onion Games...</p>

<p>You can choose to make them laugh, smile, or tell them you love them, but don't expect to win them over immediately. There will be plenty of strange and unique interactions throughout as you attempt to save the kids from the Olders. And if Moon is anything to go by, this will certainly be a bit of an odd one.</p>
<p>October is already packed full of amazing games, but this one could be one to look out for. Especially if you loved Moon (like this writer did). It's not for everyone, but there's nothing else quite like it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, we are one week and a day away from Battlefield 6 launching on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 platforms. We've known it would be a major release for the series, potentially even its biggest release, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">its multiplayer beta absolutely blew up earlier this year,</a> and now a new report shows just how big it'll be, and how big it's projected to be.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">The Game Business</a> reveals a couple of new statistics from data firm Ampere Analysis. According to Ampere, Battlefield 6 already has 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone, and the firm further predicts that it'll hit 5 million units sold within its first week.</p>



<p>Other notable statistics shared in the report include Newzoo's estimate that the beta was played by 25 million people, while Ampere sits slightly below that number in their estimates at 22 million. Newzoo also reports that the peak concurrent player count for the Battlefield 6 beta across all platforms was 10.4 million, double that of Battlefield 2042's beta, which peaked at 5.1 million.</p>



<p>Even if the reality of the Battlefield vs. Call of Duty bout this year is that Call of Duty will still sell far better, these stats are all signs that EA is making a strong effort to bring the Battlefield series back into fighting shape.</p>



<p>Who knows, we could see the next Battlefield game surpass Call of Duty in the near future, especially if Call of Duty <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to suffer from its current identity crisis</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, just days before Call of Duty Next, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-trailer-takes-shot-at-call-of-duty/">EA took a few direct shots at Call of Duty and its identity struggles</a> in a live-action trailer for Battlefield 6. EA also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">unveiled the post-launch roadmap for Battlefield 6 and its introductory season</a>. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-lawsuit-okamoto-monster-strike-capcom-2000631092</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-capcom-dev-has-the-most-absurd-take-on-the-palworld-v-pok%C3%A9mon-battle.1315081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Palworld</i> has been controversial from the get-go. With strikingly similar aesthetics and game mechanics to <i>Pokémon</i>, the game has been accused of plagiarism by fans and lawyers alike. And according to ex-Capcom dev Yoshiki Okamoto (<i>Monster Strike</i>, <i>Folklore</i>), you–yes <i>you</i>–shouldn’t even be playing <i>Palworld</i> until and unless the lawsuit is settled in Pocketpair’s favor. “I don’t want the world to think [<i>Palworld</i>] is acceptable,” Okamoto said, urging folks not to play the game.</p> <p>It was only a matter of time before Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, ever-quick to use legal means to shut down anything they consider a misuse of their IP (unless, of course, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">that IP is used to promote the rounding up and abuse of real humans</a>), would <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">sue developer Pocketpair</a>. And in a recent video (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/capcom-legend-tackles-palworld-nintendo-battle-and-manages-to-annoy-almost-everyone-its-a-game-that-transcends-the-boundaries-of-war/">h/t <i>PC Gamer</i></a>), Okamoto said Pocketpair has committed such a grave sin in their creation of <i>Palworld</i> that it “transcends the boundaries of war” and that “by playing the game you are supporting it, so please don’t buy it.”</p>

 <p>Okamoto has been torched in the comments over this assertion, especially considering his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-capcom-designer-yoshiki-okamoto-sparks-backlash-in-japan-by-saying-palworld-has-crossed-a-line-that-should-not-be-crossed">suspected use</a> of the term “<a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/anti-social-forces/">anti-social force</a>,” which is not a punk band name, but rather an actual term used to describe fraudsters and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/boryokudan">yakuza-owned</a> businesses. (It’s not entirely clear if he actually used this term, as he deliberately obfuscated the final kanji in both the video’s audio and its subtitles.)</p>

 <p>Folks in the comments of this wild video have rightly argued that many of Okamoto’s own games involve monster battling and the capturing of your foes to do your bidding, mechanics which are also at the core of <i>Pokémon</i>. Others are just voicing their frustrations with Nintendo’s now-predictable behavior when it comes to the alleged misuse of their ideas.</p>

And it doesn’t seem to be paying off for him, Cotton.</p>

Before now, you could only play them on the old Wii or through the limited-time Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Switch--which didn't even include Galaxy 2. Now, both games are available on the regular Switch and Switch 2.</p><p>There are a lot of things to appreciate with the new remasters, and Digital Foundry took a deep dive into the biggest differences and the mild downgrades. The biggest difference is that the original Switch runs the games at up to 1080p, while the Switch 2 boosts the visuals all the way to 4K resolution, making everything look much sharper and cleaner, especially on modern TVs. You can check out the full breakdown below. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWUbpoFO6-Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Basically, most of the menus, cutscenes, and controls are the same as the 2020 3D All-Stars version, including things like touchscreen and motion controls. The pre-rendered cutscenes still run at 1080p, even on Switch 2, and haven't been upgraded to 4K. That's a bit of a letdown, especially since those scenes also show some compression issues and color problems. Still, the improved resolution and sharper gameplay visuals on Switch 2 do a lot to make up for it. Shadows now show from farther away, and character models look better at a distance, too.</p><p>Another huge improvement are the new high-resolution textures. Nintendo updated nearly every surface in the game--grass, dirt, rocks, bricks, and even character clothing. These textures look much clearer and more detailed than on the original Wii. For example, Mario's overalls now have visible stitching, and Peach's eyes and eyelashes are more detailed. Some areas, like the hay in the Dino Piranha's nest and the brick paths in Honeyhive Galaxy, show big upgrades while still keeping the original design.</p><p>There are a few small downsides. The cutscene videos still look a bit compressed, and color banding can sometimes be seen in skies or backgrounds. But overall, these new versions of Galaxy 1 and 2 look better than ever. The Switch 2 version especially benefits from the higher resolution and cleaner textures, though even the regular Switch version is a nice improvement over the old Wii release. While not a full remake, this remaster does a great job of polishing up two of Nintendo's best platformers for a new generation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Digimon Story: Time Stranger a Good Starting Point for Digimon?]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/is-digimon-story-time-stranger-good-entry-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-digimon-story-time-stranger-a-good-starting-point-for-digimon.1315051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've probably seen <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-time-stranger-smt-with-better-evolution-system" rel="nofollow">the buzz for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, which is out now. It's always tricky hopping on the hype train when you feel late to the party, especially since this is the seventh game in the <em>Digimon Story</em> franchise (and let's not even try to count the number of <em>Digimon</em> games, TV shows, and movies you might have missed too).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're wondering whether <em>Time Stranger</em> is a good opportunity to see what these digital monsters are all about, I'm here to tell you that it's the perfect way to start. I myself have consumed pretty much no <em>Digimon</em> material before this, and I've found myself having a blast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a few challenges, sure, but for the most part, I'm on board. I'm not lost in some deep lore, and everything is presented in an easy-to-digest way. Furthermore, I'm having a blast.</p>



<h2>It's a Standalone Story &amp; A Great Introduction to Digimon&nbsp;</h2>

<p>My only real memories of <em>Digimon</em> are of some action figures of Devimon and WarGreymon I had as a kid. I didn't know that was their names at the time, and I really had no context about them. I knew of <em>Digimon</em>, but mostly in relation to <em>Pokemon</em> ("They're like Pokemon, but digital," said 10-year-old me, probably).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, I knew basically nothing about the Digital World—and <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is totally fine with that. It treats you like this is your first <em>Digimon</em> game. Even the term "Digimon" is seemingly new in <em>Time Stranger</em>'s universe, where scientists previously called them "phase electron lifeforms."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The early narrative makes everything about Digimon, like Digivolving and Converting, feel new to both the player and the main character. Even diving into the Digital World and seeing a Digimon society feels like a new development to the protagonist and the rest of ADAMAS, their organization.</p>

<p>To be fair, I might have missed some inside references or things that are obvious to <em>Digimon</em> veterans, but I don't feel like I've missed anything crucial. The story has its mysteries early on, but the mysteries feel within the bounds of what's normal for a narrative, instead of my lack of knowledge of the lore.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Is Easy to Learn, Hard to Master</h2>

<p>The gameplay in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is your fairly standard turn-based affair, so if you have experience with JRPGs, you'll have a good handle on things. What I was most worried about, however, was learning a whole new attribute system.</p>

<p><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> works on two major axes here: the data-virus-vaccine triad (to keep it simple), and then the whole slew of elements to worry about. The first set is fairly straightforward rock-paper-scissors (until it isn't, but you've got time to get used to it). And the latter is essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-v-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/definitive-persona-games-dilemma" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona</em></a>—keep trying elements until one sticks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've never played an RPG with two systems that stack multipliers on top of each other, but this one does a great job of simplifying things. Before you commit to an attack, it'll tell you your multiplier and what attributes are contributing to it, which is a nice tool that keeps things clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's also a personality system here that affects how each Digimon grows and what special bonus trait they'll have. It gets pretty complicated pretty quickly, and optimizing your stats requires a lot of homework. However, the game is transparent about how you can impact their personalities and how those will impact their growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the gameplay is a lot easier to digest because of little quality-of-life additions like these. Clarity is key here, so learning the complex systems is as easy as possible. That only makes it easier to digest the world, lore, and narrative. Furthermore, if you get fully hooked, you have a long on-ramp before you need to start taking the systems seriously to min-max your stats.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Some Hiccups Along the Way</h2>

<p>Of course, it's not a fully smooth on-ramp to get on the Digimon highway. While the game clearly defines its systems well enough, that doesn't change the fact that it's a lot of systems to learn. It's easy to get lost in the numbers, and if you get option paralysis early, it could be too overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even simple choices like Digivolution can feel a little daunting. Unlike <em>Pokemon</em>, it isn't a linear system. Each Digimon has a handful of evolutions, and two different ones could Digivolve into the same champion-level Digimon. You can De-Digivolve whenever you want, too, but that level of options can cause choice paralysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, if you're familiar with <em>Shin Megami-sona</em>, there's a similar vibe of having to play a little fast and loose with how your monsters transform. Sometimes you just have to deal with the consequences later as you're learning the ropes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will say, though, the personality system does feel the most daunting, of all the systems in the game. In the early couple hours, it didn't feel so important that it's impacted my fun, but I am starting to see it impact how I want to strategize my Digivolutions.</p>



<p>And this is a small nitpick but relevant all the same: I feel like the naming conventions and the general visual design of the Digimon is something that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I think it's absolutely ridiculous to remember names like GeoGreymon or Agumon (Bond of Bravery).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, I find that the monster designs across the spectrum to feel inconsistent and weird, and not in a flattering way. Some Digimon feels like they're from entirely different universes, while others just look plain ridiculous. That all comes down to personal taste for sure, but regardless, how much you enjoy the Digimon's designs will impact how much you enjoy the game overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, overall, <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is an absolutely stellar way to hop onto the <em>Digimon Story</em> subset of games and the <em>Digimon</em> world as whole. It's an easy way to learn about the universe, and it's a neatly wrapped package of RPG goodness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And even if you don't quite fall in love with the world and the universe, it's a rock-solid RPG system that's meaty and gratifying. It's simple enough that you can keep things a little casual, but there's enough simmering underneath to sink your teeth into.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Videogame developers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM have founded what they're calling "the first recognised workplace union in the UK games industry", operating as part of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. It's yet another twist in the tale of a once-feted development studio who are now heavily associated with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">toxic layoffs, alleged fraud and diasporic feuding</a>.</p>
<p>"The recognition process provides workers and management with a strong framework to engage and negotiate on workplace-related matters," the unionised workers announce in a <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/">press release</a>, passed along by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/workers-at-disco-elysium-studio-za-um-have-unionized">Game Developer</a>. "A committee of elected workplace representatives will regularly meet to discuss matters brought forward by the game developers at ZA/UM and management, with the support of union officials."</p>
<p>The press release notes the past couple of year's staggering quantity of mass layoffs, commenting that "job security [is] one of the union's central focuses". It includes thoughts from Eugenia Peruzzo, organising officer of the IWGB Game Workers Union, who comments that "recognition agreements lay the groundwork for a healthy relationship between the company and workers and rebalance the scale of powers after a few terrible years for the game industry and the redundancies we have seen happening at ZA/UM lately." Peruzzo is confident that more UK videogame workers will unionise. "Rest assured that this is not a one off, but this is an avalanche in the making," she says.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">much fuller write-up of the situation on GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which includes an interview with current ZA/UM president and Private Division co-founder Ed Tomaszewski. He observes of studio management's negotiations with the emerging union "that when we did talk about it, it was clear that recognising a union was core to our values as a studio, to be providing fair working practices."</p>
<p>In the GI piece, Tomaszewski also pushes back a little against some of the accusations or "characterisations" levelled at ZA/UM by certain former staff. I imagine that said former staff will be pushing back against Tomaszewski in turn.</p>

<p>ZA/UM have lost many of the people who made Disco Elysium a hit, but according to Game Developer, they now have "almost 100" people on the books after laying off a quarter of the studio and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancelling a Disco Elysium expansion</a> early last year. Their current project is Zero Parades, a colourful espionage CRPG James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">summarised</a> as "Disco Elysium in glasses and a moustache", adding that "it isn't always clear whether Zero Parades is inspired by Disco Elysium or beholden to it."</p><p>Many of the departed Disco Elysium staff are now working on spiritual successors of one kind or another. Over at Summer Eternal, several former ZA/UM staff including writers Argo Tuulik and Dora Klindžić are making Red Rooster, which was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-former-disco-elysium-devs-of-summer-eternal-announce-their-new-game-red-rooster-in-the-form-of-a-book">teased in curious book anthology form</a>. Longdue Games are making Hopetown, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">a psychogeogratuitous RPG which Nic summarised as "Nathan Barley on the bus"</a>; their trueblood Disco complement includes ZA/UM's co-founder Martin Luiga, plus Piotr Sobolewski from outsourcing team Knights of Unity. Dark Math Games boast of former Disco motion graphic designer Timo Albert and former ZA/UM producer and investor Kaur Kender; they're making the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-be-disco-elysium-successor-xxx-nightshift-morphs-from-an-isometric-rpg-into-a-third-person-ski-resort-murder-mystery">recently renamed Tangerine Antarctic</a>, which has a "dopamine buffet".</p>
<p>I offer this summary to the next RPS staffer to write about ZA/UM-related matters, in frail hope that the situation won't be anymore complicated by then. Oh god, I've just remembered we haven't yet found out what former Disco writer Robert Kurvitz and artist Aleksander Rostov are making at their new outfit Red Info.</p>

              <p>I’ve rather given it away with the headline there, but I couldn’t help myself. Lego’s <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/game-boy-72046">recently launched Game Boy</a> is the most extraordinarily satisfying build, with results that feel uncannily realistic. It looks and feels perfect, complete with a just-too-murky screen to thoroughly emulate the real thing.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-pre-order-commercial-nintendo-1851786845">Announced back in July</a> and immediately up for pre-order (which I did as soon as I’d written the article), the Lego Game Boy was clearly a labor of love, and in some ways a compromise for Lego given the number of bespoke pieces made just for this set. From the curved and grilled panel to the fuchsia caps for the A and B buttons, a few plastic liberties have been taken to make this such a stunning replication of the 1989 handheld. And wow, it nails every element, from the bizarrely realistic-feeling d-pad (despite being so ostentatiously a Lego cross) to the spongy A and B buttons, all made complete with the epic and satisfying “CLICK!” of the on-off switch.</p>

 <p>By my count, there are at least 12 pieces unique to this set, and wonderfully this includes a large number of pre-printed pieces with distinctive Game Boy designs and fonts. Where these would usually be stickers, Lego has saved people like me who live in fear of such operations, and I’m so very grateful. Placing stickers, especially long, thin ones, requires the steady hands of a surgeon, and not the shaky incompetent flippers on the end of my arms. Still, for those who enjoy the adrenaline rush of the completely irredeemable moments, both the game cartridges you build require a large sticker be placed.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631067" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631067"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631067">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Another aspect that makes this build so special is that—and I realize how pretentious this sounds, but it’s definitely true—the instructions are put together with wit and timing. The first thing you’re asked to build is one of the two cartridges, along with a display stand for it that contains a slot for storing the spare lenticular cards. But rather than going straight onto the second, you instead are launched into the Game Boy itself, building it from the inside out. This means that you’re constructing its green network board first, then adding the base below, before putting in the mechanisms for the buttons and the buttons themselves, and only after that’s all in place putting together its complete shell. It’s so delightful that it’s constructed just as a Game Boy would have been, and those button mechanisms are just so smart. The d-pad uses a concealed rubber tire to provide the push-back when you press it in any of its four directions, while the A and B buttons get their exact sponginess from a cunningly placed rubber band pegged around three c-arm clips. The results feel so realistic, making these super-smart tricks feel all the more remarkable.</p>

 <p>Further, it’s only after you’ve finished the main Game Boy that you realize you were unwittingly adding amazing details like a realistic-looking DC inlet at the bottom, a headphone jack on the left side, and the scrolling contrast and volume wheels. Oh, and the unexpectedly hefty click of the on-off button is still making me happy.</p>

 <p>The smart nature of the instructions is completed by ending on the second cartridge, which you then slide into the back of the Game Boy, where even here it slots in with a satisfying clunk. It’s an incredibly rewarding way to finish, and you don’t have that moment of ending with the boring fiddly bits that so often marks the finish of a Lego build. There’s no putting the side-character together, or wedging flowers on all the plant stems here; that other cartridge and both display stands are already completed, and inserting that cartridge is your final moment.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631068">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, the one criticism I have here is the last thing I thought I’d be saying, but there <em>are</em> a couple of flaky moments in the instructions. One piece type in particular is always shown such that you can’t see that it has an L-bend, and there are three or four odd moments where it obfuscates where a piece should be placed&nbsp;<em>underneath</em> what you’ve already built. Nothing disastrous, nothing I couldn’t quickly figure out, but unusual for Lego. But that’s it.</p>

 <p>OK so, I swear this is true: As I was writing this review my ten-year-old son came into my study and saw the Lego Game Boy on its Lego stand next to me on my desk. “Oh, a new device!” he said. I handed it to him, and he muttered, “Game Boy.” He’s never held a real one. “Look more closely,” I told him, and he read bits of the writing, pressed some of the buttons, and said, “What?” So I took it from him, flipped it over, removed the back panel and took out the <em>Zelda</em> cartridge, revealing some of the Lego innards. “OH, IT’S LEGO!” he declared. I switched the lenticular out and put it back together, and he exclaimed, “This is SO COOL!” So there you go, a second opinion.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631069">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth noting that the lenticulars are splendid. There’s the main loading screen one, which has the word “Nintendo” scroll up and down just like it should. Then there’s one for <em>Zelda</em> and one for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>, to match the two carts. The&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> one is perhaps the more disappointing, given the only movement is Zelda turning to look at Link while some V-like birds move about in the sky.&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>‘s is far better, showing Mario jump up to hit a&nbsp;? block and reveal a star, with a couple of Goombas moving below. Both only have two images, but the&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> version feels a lot more dynamic. Meanwhile, the Nintendo logo screen has seven panels, such that you get a weirdly smooth scroll. And as I mentioned up top, once they’re in the Game Boy behind the plastic screen (it’s a Lego window frame with the plastic glass inserted, repurposed), it really gives that authentic dullness that’s dramatically improved by holding it in direct light.</p> <p>I realize I’ve just totally nerded out here, and I’m good with that. I wasn’t even a proper Game Boy kid, my primary experience being a splendid summer vacation when a school friend lent me hers for a full six weeks and I just obsessed over it. But even that established a lifetime’s nostalgia for me, that’s duly met and respected by this perfect Lego recreation.</p> <p>For the quality here, and the real pleasure gained from both the build and the finished result, $60 feels like a fantastic price. I usually find Lego’s prices egregious, often offensive, but the company could have been a <em>lot</em> more greedy here and wasn’t. Yes, you could also spend $60 on a handheld device that’ll emulate every Game Boy game and more beside, but honestly, this Lego brick (pun so very much intended) just feels very special.</p>

This includes tweaks like buffing the Forgeknight Amon in general so he's as strong as the other Vault Hunters, increasing the Exo-Soldier Rafa's summons and the Siren Vex's melee power to make those builds better in the endgame, and adjusting the Gravitar Harlowe's Stasis ability to ensure it's "getting value" for you.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>While sending the Vault Hunters to the gym for strength training is the main highlight of this new update, Gearbox Software also made some other changes to the looter-shooter. This includes buffing the weekly Big Encore boss, moving Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine and altering its available offerings, and adding an auto-clearing of Borderlands 4's stale shaders to prevent performance degradation on some PCs.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launched on September 12 to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorable critical reception</a>. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">our Borderlands 4 review</a>, critic Jordan Ramee awarded the game a 7/10, saying, "All in all, if uncovering loot, crafting builds, and unleashing chaotic mayhem is what you're looking for, Borderlands 4 has you covered."

			<p>Frictional Games, the studio behind the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amnesia-the-bunker-walking-forward-into-the-abyss/">beloved horror series Amnesia</a> and <a href="http://wccftech.com/soma-is-a-great-horror-adventure-for-pc-ps4-but-how-do-the-2-versions-compare/">sci-fi horror game SOMA</a>, has teased its next project with a new eerie trailer simply titled 'Frictional_Next_Project.mp4.' The trailer is a series of slow zooming and panning shots of spaces, some of them seeming to be from a grand hall of sorts, others from a research lab, and others from the hidden spaces behind a wall.</p>



<p>While the shots switch from one space to another, an echo of voices chanting something quite difficult to make out adds to the atmosphere, along with its dark and moody lighting all throughout the trailer.</p>

<iframe title="Frictional_Next_Project.mp4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmHnnvQQxaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The description for the video includes <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">a link to a website for Hotel Samsara</a>, which seems to be a fictional hotel that can be recognized from some of the shots in the trailer. There's also a space to request updates by putting in your email, which brings up an odd question, asking if you are "<em>One of many</em>" or "<em>One and only</em>."</p>



<p>It all seems like hints and clues towards what this new project will be, but a lot of players in the Frictional Games community are already pointing towards it being a new game in SOMA's universe. Community members<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15fHWr4f_nTwOzgOYJt9vzrXY3K_RioAdeOHYLAWgnp8/edit?gid=1569727250#gid=1569727250"> have even put together a spreadsheet</a> detailing what they believe to be clues pointing towards it being a new SOMA game.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn more about this new project soon. </p>
