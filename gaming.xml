                <p>The Switch has seen several HD remasters and remakes released on it lately, and if you didn't pick up Luigi's Mansion 2 HD at launch last month, you can get a pretty good discount on it right now. Over at Woot, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fluigis-mansion-2-hd-international-version-region-free-1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmamma-mia-luigis-mansion-2-hd-for-switch-has-already-received-a-big-discount%2F1100-6525114%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can save 25% on the game</a>, as the retailer is offering it for the frightfully good price of $45.</p><p>Woot's listing shows the US box art, but the URL mentions "international version," so it's possible you'd get an imported copy from a different region. However, this wouldn't change the playability of the game, as the Nintendo Switch is a region-free console. The only difference here would be the ESRB rating on the box would be replaced with another region's ratings board logo.</p><p>But back to the game itself. Originally released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD stars Mario's taller brother as he finds himself in another haunted neighborhood. Fortunately, the plumber is equipped with some ghostbusting gear and can hoover up the pesky phantoms haunting Evershade Valley. This remaster updates the game for the Switch, and while the old-school tank controls do take some getting used to, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is full of charm and humor that gives it a quirky personality.</p><p>"Luigi's Mansion 2 HD isn't as essential as some other recent Switch remasters, but it's a charming look at how the ghostly adventure series found its footing," Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review-weegee-board/1900-6418246/" data-ref-id="1900-6418246">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fvideo-game-summer-sale&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmamma-mia-luigis-mansion-2-hd-for-switch-has-already-received-a-big-discount%2F1100-6525114%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Woot is also holding a big sale</a> on video games and accessories, so if you're looking to save some more cash, there's a great selection of things to check out right now on that site.

<section><p>A class that doesn't feel like anything seen in the series before, Spiritborn channel the gods themselves to decimate foes in visceral fashion.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> launched with only returning classes from past entries to choose from, all instantly familiar to fans of fantasy RPGs: Barbarian, Rogue, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Druid. One class that was notably missing was a Paladin-type--some kind of holy warrior to dole out divine punishment to demons and evildoers in kind. Many fans expected Diablo 4's first expansion would look to fill that gap in the base game's roster. Instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred</a> will introduce a brand-new class to the franchise, one that is fast, frenetic, and fun: the Spiritborn.</p><p dir="ltr">I got the chance to spend two hours putting the Spiritborn through its paces at a preview event, using four premade, level-30 builds and talking to Blizzard about how the new class came to be. The Spiritborn isn't a Paladin, but that's for the best--it's something entirely new, and a class that doesn't feel like anything fans have ever seen before in Diablo. That being said, it does provide some of the same power-fantasy those who had hoped for a holy warrior might find appealing, as the Spiritborn channel the power of gods themselves to rip their foes apart.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred - 24 Minutes Of Spiritborn Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Welcome To The Jungle</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Spiritborn are deeply tied to the new region being introduced in Vessel of Hatred: the dense jungles of Nahantu that players may remember from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a>. During Diablo 4's development, Blizzard knew where the story would take Neyrelle and the soulstone of Mephisto. Rather than shoehorn in a class that had little to do with the new part of Sanctuary players were set to explore in the expansion, Blizzard instead opted to create a new one that would have a deep connection to Nahantu and establish a strong sense of cohesion with the expansion as a whole. It was from that goal the idea of the Spiritborn was conceptualized.</p><p dir="ltr">Before unlocking their full power, those seeking to become Spiritborn undergo a coming-of-age ritual deep in the forest, one that the vast majority of participants don't survive. Those who come out the other side undergo a metamorphosis in the Spirit Realm after communing with powerful Spirit Guardians: massive, ghost-like animals that are the embodiment of the laws of Nahantu's unforgiving jungles. Ever since the events of Diablo 2, the Spiritborn have been lying in wait, anticipating the return of evil to Nahantu. The arrival of Mephisto's soulstone to the region sees them pushed into battle against the forces of Hell once more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336249-diablo4spiritbornarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336249" data-ratio="0.5622641509434" data-width="1855" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336249-diablo4spiritbornarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336249"></a><figcaption>Spiritborn wield glaives, polearms, and quarterstaffs while channeling their Spirit Guardians to devastating effect.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336249-diablo4spiritbornarmor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Spiritborn channel the power of the Spirit Guardians, but they are formidable martial warriors as well, wielding glaives, polearms, and quarterstaffs to attack enemies with a rapid flurry of blows. Their fighting style is inspired by different real-world martial art styles, bringing a dash of Diablo 3's Monk to the class. Meanwhile, their look takes inspiration from a number of pre-Columbian civilizations like the Aztec and Mayans. Eleni Rivera-Colon, associate narrative designer on Diablo 4, said Blizzard made sure not to "copy and paste" an existing culture. Instead, Blizzard imagined what such a culture might look like in the dark world of Sanctuary. Spiritborn don't wear armor in the traditional sense, as their clothing is not meant to protect them so much as to help honor and channel the Spirit Guardians, while also enabling the acrobatic and rapid movements seen in the class' gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Spirit Guardians are] not just protecting the Spirit Realm, but they're also protecting the Spiritborn that's calling upon them, [so Spiritborn] don't really need this heavy armor," Rivera-Colon said. "They need something that's going to make them very fast and can move very well. All of those things played into [the look of the class]."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Choose Your Spirit Guardians</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">It's hard to overstate how big an impact the Spirit Guardians have on the Spiritborn's gameplay. Each Spiritborn skill is associated with one of the four guardians, and players can choose to focus on skills of one particular type or mix and match for a playstyle all their own.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Jaguar abilities are aggressive and mobile, with combo attacks that deal fire damage and generate Ferocity, a stacking attack-speed buff.</li><li dir="ltr">Skills channeling the stalwart Gorilla Spirit Guardian are designed for frontline warriors who want to absorb damage and dish it out in equal measure, with many Gorilla skills generating Resolve, an additional form of damage mitigation.</li><li dir="ltr">Eagle Spirit Guardian skills revolve around precision, movement, and lightning damage while also generating Focus, a buff improving evasion and increasing movement speed.</li><li dir="ltr">Most terrifying is the Centipede Spirit Guardian, the embodiment of decay and rebirth in the jungle, and whose skills deal poison damage to enemies and restrict their movements.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336255-diablo4spiritborncentipede.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336255" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336255-diablo4spiritborncentipede.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336255"></a><figcaption>The Centipede Ultimate skill blasts enemies with beams of concentrated poison.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336255-diablo4spiritborncentipede.jpg"></figure><p>These Spirit Guardians truly are the star of the show. Basic abilities and core abilities give players just a glimpse of each Spirit Guardian's power as their essence is channeled through the Spiritborn's weapon. Unleashing one of the class's four Ultimate skills (one for each Spirit Guardian) brings the gods of the Spirit Realm crashing down onto foes in their full glory.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The Centipede Ultimate ability executes low-health enemies and fires beams of poison at distant threats.</li><li dir="ltr">The Jaguar unleashes a fiery hurricane of attacks.</li><li dir="ltr">The Gorilla's Ultimate mimics its "stand your ground" playstyle, pummeling a designated area repeatedly.</li><li dir="ltr">For the Eagle's Ultimate, the bird of prey crashes down and unleashes a storm of lightning in a location, knocking down foes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In my two hours with the expansion, I spent time playing a number of different builds, fighting my way through some of Nahantu's new strongholds and dungeons. Some builds featured skills that focused largely on only one Spirit Guardian. Others featured a combination of skills from two or three Spirit Guardians, shoring up the weaknesses of one Spirit Guardian with the strengths of another. Even for those who go all-in on one Spirit Guardian, the Spiritborn's unique class mechanic, the Spirit Hall, allows players to access some of the strengths or unique features of other Spirit Guardians without necessarily having abilities native to those Guardians on their action bar. Players can pledge devotion to two Spirit Guardians in the Spirit Hall, the first at level 15 upon completing the Spiritborn's class quest (which is said to be longer and more involved than the class quests seen in the base game) and another at level 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336257-diablo4spiritbornjaguar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336257-diablo4spiritbornjaguar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336257"></a><figcaption>The Jaguar Ultimate skill deals massive fire damage to nearby enemies, and, if you're lucky, can be used multiple times in quick succession.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336257-diablo4spiritbornjaguar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 class designer Bjorn Mikkelson said the team wants to give players the tools to make whatever build they want to make, whether it's sticking largely to one Spirit Guardian or branching out into multiple.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the start, something we were interested in was really exploring what it would look like for a class that kind of has the ability to mix-and-match," Mikkelson said. "That was something we always really wanted. 'Play Your Way' has always been something we've said for Diablo 4, and Spiritborn was like, 'Can we take that to another level?'"</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Deadly Build Possibilities</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Combat can feel wildly different depending on which Spirit Guardian's abilities players opt to use. Playing an all-Gorilla build feels slow and steady, focusing less on mobility or evading damage and instead on standing your ground before pounding enemies into the dirt. Conversely, a Jaguar build feels kinetic and frantic. Many Jaguar skills dash to enemies and can be used multiple times in quick succession, including the Jaguar Ultimate ability, resulting in a combo-like flow state. Eagle builds are more ranged-focused and extremely mobile, but require careful positioning and ability usage. Centipede, meanwhile, debuffs enemies with slows and poison, offering a more passive playstyle as enemies die all around you, in turn creating more death and decay.</p><p dir="ltr">Of the four, I found myself drawn most to Jaguar, largely due to its quick-paced gameplay and the ability to chain attacks together. Especially fun was that, thanks to a talent point, there was a decent chance of the Jaguar Ultimate abilty's cooldown being instantly reset whenever I killed an enemy while it was active. That allowed me to continue summoning the Spirit Guardian repeatedly for a limited number of times, after which all surrounding enemies had been reduced to ash.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336258-diablo4spirithall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336258" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336258-diablo4spirithall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336258"></a><figcaption>The Spiritborn's class mechanic, the Spirit Hall, lets players gain additional benefits from up to two different Spirit Guardians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4336258-diablo4spirithall.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I didn't have time to dive into the deep end and meticulously theorycraft my own unique build featuring skills from multiple Spirit Guardians, I can already see the potential. Jaguar builds are more fast-paced and fragile, but splashing in a few defensive Gorilla skills might help to make the build sturdier. Meanwhile, combining the evasiveness of Eagle skills with the debilitating effects of Centipede skills could result in a build that would allow players to run circles around their slowed and poisoned enemies, all the while picking them off at range. There are tons of possibilities, but players can certainly stick to one particular playstyle (made simple by the color-coated nature of each Spirit Guardian's abilities displayed in the skill tree) and find success doing so. However, the true potential of the class comes from blending different Spirit Guardian skills. Mixing in different abilities to help eliminate some of the weaknesses inherent to builds that focus on a single Spirit Guardian is entirely the point, associate class designer Stephen Stewart said.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's where the beauty of the class really starts to sing," Stewart said.</p><p dir="ltr">From my time playing it, I'm inclined to agree. The Spiritborn makes for a fascinating cocktail of gameplay variety. I was never bored trying out the different builds, and as I saw more of what the class had to offer, lightbulbs began to go off in my head as I started piecing together ideas for how I could combine my favorite elements of each playstyle into one all my own. Mixing together abilities from different categories already exists in Diablo 4, but the strongly defined identities of each Spirit Guardian and their corresponding skills make it even easier at a glance to understand how a particular skill could slot into a build.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who had hoped to see a class from Diablo's past make a return for Diablo 4's first expansion may initially be disappointed, but even as a huge Paladin fan, I found it refreshing to see a new idea brought to life. Creating a new class that feels right at home in the gothic fantasy world of Diablo while also not relying on standard fantasy archetypes is no small task, but I came away impressed at the attention to detail and thought that had gone into the worldbuilding, visuals, and gameplay for the Spiritborn. There is still much we don't know about the story of the Spiritborn and the expansion as a whole, but I'm excited to dive in and see if Blizzard can stick the landing. As for the Diablo 4 team behind the class, the Spiritborn is a chance for them to put their own stamp on the franchise, rather than simply following in the footsteps of what came before.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's the idea of the open space of creativity, right?" Stewart said. "Because the five existing classes are ones that we've seen in the Diablo world before, but getting that opportunity to just go free your mind... We've done a really good job of being stewards of the franchise, and now let's add our footprint, our DNA, to a brand-new class. For me, there's a lot of reverence and apprehension and fear and excitement and all that, because I was a fan of these games before I worked on these games. And so it's cool to say, 'I made that, the new thing,' rather than taking a thing that had already existed and putting a new spin on it."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion, and its new Spiritborn class, launch on October 8.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>' Steam page has been inundated with negative user reviews following the announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-will-now-have-two-battle-passes-per-season-says-respawn/1100-6524756/">Season 22 will feature two battle passes</a>. Prior to the July 8 announcement, the game was earning roughly 150 to 300 negative user reviews (and a similar amount of positive user reviews) daily. But in the days following the announcement of the battle pass changes, the game has earned a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">total of 35,035 negative reviews</a>, dropping its score for the month of July to "overwhelmingly negative." Only 1,997 of the user reviews posted since July 8 are positive.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting with Season 1: Wild Frontier (which launched in March 2019), Apex's battle passes have stuck to an unchanging recipe. Each season has featured a new battle pass with 110 levels of cosmetics and in-game currency for players to unlock after purchase. Previously, Apex's seasonal battle passes cost 950 Apex Coins ($9.50 USD) each, though players could spend 2,800 AC ($28 USD) to automatically unlock the first 25 levels of the battle pass. But starting in Season 22, Respawn will be releasing two 60-level battle passes per season, with the first battle pass launching alongside the new season, and the second arriving at the season's midpoint.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.<br>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. <br>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p>  — Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there's been a price change: Each battle pass will now cost $10 USD ($20 USD for the upgraded version), and battle passes will no longer be available to purchase with Apex Coins, a change that players are especially displeased with. Previously, each battle pass included enough Apex Coins to purchase the next season's battle pass, meaning that once players purchased and completed a single battle pass, the next season's pass would effectively be available for free, provided they didn't spend their Apex Coins on something else.</p><p dir="ltr">With the new changes to the battle-pass system, players who wish to complete an entire season's worth of battle-pass content will be paying over twice as much per season as they previously were, will not be able to use Apex Coins to obtain the battle pass for free, and will be faced with 120 levels of content to unlock instead of 110. The mid-season split also means there will be less time to unlock those rewards. Each season of Apex Legends lasts roughly three months, and it's common for players to wait until the end of the season to finish grinding out the XP needed to finish their battle pass. Now, players who want to get their money's worth and stay up-to-date with the game's cosmetics will need to ensure they've unlocked all 60 levels of each battle pass every month-and-a-half.</p><p dir="ltr">"​​Buying the battle pass for free with the money from older ones is literally the only thing that makes you feel rewarded as an older player and they removed that from us," reads one negative review from a player who has spent over 1,500 hours playing the game.</p><p>In total, Apex has earned 879,014 user reviews in its lifetime, and the game currently holds a "mostly positive" overall rating, with 73% of user reviews giving the game a thumbs up. Respawn has yet to comment on player feedback regarding the new battle-pass system, but the studio did unveil <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1813953109993083061" rel="nofollow ">a new collection of premium cosmetics</a> via the game's social media channels on July 18.</p>

		<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:28">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, the free-to-play vehicular combat game, has had its early access release date confirmed, and that date is August 6th. The announcement comes after a successful open beta was held in May 2024. Players who participated in the beta got a taste of the brutal races and explosive combat that Speed Freeks had to offer. It featured a game mode called Kill Konvoy, where two teams of eight players battled it out to get their Stompa to the finish line first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLRTsjrCP00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">In Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, players take control of different warbands of Orks, with the two modes confirmed as the aforementioned Kill Konvoy, and Deff Rally. The latter has teams of 8 battle against each other, or race to capture points. The game is entirely free to play, with developer Caged Element Inc stating that there will be no pay to win elements. All paid content will be optional and just customisation options. The progress players make in Early Access will carry over to the full release, which is expected later this year. When that full version releases a new map and new vehicle will be added, along with significant gameplay upgrades.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">To play Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, players will need to create a Speed Freeks account. The dev team explain the reason, saying, <em>“We understand that some gamers are tired of making accounts, we get it. But collecting anonymous user data allows us to improve the game, and the ability to get in touch with players directly impacts the number of users that will be playing it. Free to play games have always survived with the assistance of user accounts, and we’re asking you to make one so that it helps create a better, free experience that you guys can possibly enjoy for years.The Speed Freeks account takes a few minutes to create, but we hope that you’ll take that time to quickly sign up and try our game.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-is-at-gamescom-but-only-for-the-yu-gi-oh-tcg.931167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/konami-is-at-gamescom-but-only-for-the-yu-gi-oh-tcg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, the Gamescom staff sent out an email to the press mentioning some of the confirmed exhibitors, and that list included KONAMI. Indeed, when checking the Gamescom biz app, I could verify that KONAMI has secured a booth in Hall 4.1, A071/D080, which is in the business area.</p>
<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that they'd bring their highly anticipated remakes: Silent Hill 2 and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, that's not at all what KONAMI is showing there this year: as I confirmed with their PR agency, the Japanese publisher will be focusing solely on the popular Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that's extremely disappointing both to us as press members and especially for you as readers, since there won't be any new impressions or information to be shared for either game. It is surprising, to say the least, especially for Silent Hill 2, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch just a month and a half after Gamescom</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date yet for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but KONAMI has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opens-pre-orders-confirms-battle-scars-will-remain-on-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> pre-orders for the retail editions. As such, it is unlikely that the game is more than a few months away from its launch.</p>
<p>Both remakes are powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology. While MGS is being made at an internal studio (with some additional help from Virtuos), Silent Hill 2 has been developed by Bloober Team, the Polish studio behind Layers of Fear, Observer, Blair Witch, and The Medium.</p>
<p>While Gamescom attendees and fans all over the globe will be inevitably disappointed with this news, it's still possible KONAMI is keeping new info and/or trailers for one or even both games in store for the Tokyo Game Show event, which will take place between September 26 and 29 this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, look forward to our live coverage from the German event in about a month from now.</p>

</ul>



<h3>Design</h3>



<ul>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>It centers on dexterity and will be the fastest class in Diablo 4.</li>



<li>Spirit guardians are summoned, each having their own skills while summoned</li>



<li>Jaguar spirit guardian is designed around movement, AoE damage, and attack speed</li>



<li>Gorilla is more of a tank with a focus on damage reduction, damage reflection, and defense</li>



<li>Eagle focuses on movement speed, range, and being precise with attacks</li>



<li>Centipede “represents the abstract concept of life and death” that focuses on persistence. It utilizes life steal, poison damage, and crowd control. </li>



<li>You can go all-in on one spirit guardian or choose to mix and match with a combination of the four.</li>



<li>“All about personalization and expressing yourself,” the developers say.</li>



<li><strong>Spirit Hall Mechanic</strong> – gives you more customization options in the form of various bonuses.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-itemization">Itemization</h3>



<ul>
<li>Hybridization, Power Augmenting, Sub Power, and Unique Items are the four primary focuses</li>



<li>Hybridization are items that will allow stats to work together</li>



<li>Power Augmenting that will allow you take skills and boost it to a higher level</li>



<li>Sub powers are similar to skills but don’t exist in your treet</li>



<li>Unique Items such as the Score of the Earth boots allow you to build your character in the way you see fit within the class.</li>
</ul>

We really do seem to be living through a craze for PS1-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a>. Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it's turn-based zombie crunching combined with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> scavenging to survive and get more powerful. It's arriving on Steam sometime soon and it's probably worth a looksy if you're after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.</p>

<p>In Vultures, you play as a Vulture. No, not a grizzled bird that picks apart corpses with its beak and sits atop rocks for the vast majority of its lifecycle, but a human special operative - an operative who must clean up an infested metropolis through the power of turn-based clicking.</p>

<p>Vultures is neither a linear story like Resident Evil nor an open world. Instead, it's a roguelike where you're attempting to survive increasingly difficult scenarios and "get out alive with the target". At the beginning of each mission, you'll choose from a number of agents with their own combat styles, customise their loadouts, and grow stronger by scavenging things along the way. From my experience with survival horror: take the shotgun and everything will right itself.</p>
<p>Going off the trailer, it looks like blowing off limbs to thwart zombie approaches in tight spaces is the move. Otherwise, there's a strong Resi feel to the item rotating, keycode smashing, and inventory Tetris. I'd imagine with this roguelike, the horror element lies more in the fear of impending death by turn-based RNG or a gaggle of zombies you can't quite outmuscle. If you're after genuine scares and persisting in a space that only gets spookier and scarier, I can't see the bittiness of a roguelike being conducive to that. But then again, I don't think this is what it's going for and/or I'm very happy to be proven wrong!</p>

<p>Ubisoft released its first quarter financials for the 2025 fiscal year on Thursday. With the financial results came praise for the launch of the free-to-play shooter xDefiant.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s release</a>, xDefiant had what it viewed as an “encouraging” start to its life since launch on May 21.</p>



<p>“The game outperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per<br>session day,” the studio said.</p>



<p>After its launch, xDefiant reached 10 million players in its first two weeks. The game also saw multiple updates, including the addition of two game modes in Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-just-xdefiant">It’s Not Just xDefiant</h2>



<p>In addition to the success of xDefiant, Ubisoft says that Rainbow Six Siege, The Crew, and Assassin’s Creed have all helped with early financial success. That success comes in the form of $316.5 million in revenue. That is up 8.3% year-over-year as well as up 5.5% from initial target numbers.</p>



<p>The company also says that it’s expecting the upcoming launch of Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows to add to that yearly revenue. For the second quarter, Ubisoft expects its net bookings or revenue to be about $545 million (€500m).</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio, once again, reaffirmed its push to expanding its Games as a Service (GaaS) offerings. They specifically mentioned the upcoming Year 2 roadmap for The Crew Motorfest as well as the Season 3 content for Skill and Bones.</p>



<p>Two games that will no longer be coming in fiscal year 2025 are Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence due to the teams “taking the necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimized KPIs in the context of a demanding yet very large market.”</p>

<p>Ahead of the game’s global release, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-team-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Sports has released</a> full details on College Football 25 Team Builder. </p>



<p>First thing’s first, Team Builder will launch on Thursday night for College Football 25 for everyone. It’ll be accessible via <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/team-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official website</a> when it goes live.</p>



<p>As far as what you’ll be able to create, it appears that almost nothing is off limits for players. Features of the mode include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Logo and identity creation</strong> — You can create a primary, secondary, and tertiary logo. You can upload your own or choose and edit a generic logo</li>



<li><strong>Choose your uniform provider </strong>— Nike, Under Armor, or Adidas can be selected. The choice will impact the equipment available to your team as well as patterns on the jerseys and more.</li>



<li><strong>Multiple Uniform Combinations </strong>— You can have up to five total presets. To break it down, that’s five helmets, five jerseys, five pants, and five socks. This gives you 625 different combination options for your school.</li>



<li><strong>Helmet Freedom </strong>— There are matte, shiny, and chrome options for your helmets; custom logo placement, multiple color options, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Custom Layers </strong>— Rather than all one flat image, the designs for your uniform are individual custom layers. On helmets, you can have up to seven layers.</li>



<li><strong>Stadium and Field </strong>— There are eight components overall to choose from. For your stadium, there is no custom stadium creation. Instead, you select one of the 134 team stadiums within the game. From there, you create the name, how the crowd looks, the type of playing surface, the colors of the surface, logos, endzone design, benches, and sidelines.</li>



<li><strong>Custom Roster </strong>— With your team made, you get to modify your roster and set your playbooks.</li>
</ul>



<p>Team Builder Teams can only be used in private Online Dynasties. You can import up to 16 teams per Dynasty.</p>

<p>Nintendo's Switch launched in March 2017, and all available information indicates that the company is on track to announce a successor early next year. It's that timing that makes the launch of Nintendo's latest Switch accessory so odd: The company has announced a first-party charging cradle for Joy-Con controllers, which up until now have been charged by slotting them into the console itself, via Nintendo's sold-separately <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N33MFPK/?tag=arstech20-20">Joy-Con charging grip</a>, or with third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p>The Nintendo of Europe account on X, formerly Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1813846178439557413">announced</a> that the charging accessory—formally called the "Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way)"—will be released on October 17. It will work with both Joy-Cons and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers/">Switch Online wireless NES controllers</a>, and the charging cradle can be separated from its stand (where it looks a lot like the Joy-Con charging grip but without the grip part).</p>
<p>Power is provided via a USB-C port on top of the stand, which can either be connected to one of the Switch dock's USB ports or to a separate USB-C charger.&nbsp;Other Switch controllers, including the Pro Controller and the SNES and N64 replica controllers, are charged via USB-C directly.</p>
<p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201071/nintendo-switch-joy-con-charging-accessory-gaming">reports</a> that the accessory has only been announced for Europe and Japan so far, though it will presumably also come to North America at some point. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, either.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 is around the corner</h2>
<p>Why would Nintendo release a new first-party charging accessory for your old console just months before it's slated to announce its next-generation console? Rumors about the design of the Switch 2 could hold some hints.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Accessory makers and others <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">with firsthand knowledge of the Switch 2</a> have suggested that the new console will come with redesigned Joy-Cons with additional buttons and a magnetic attachment mechanism. This would likely make it impossible to attach current-generation Joy-Cons, which physically interlock with the Switch and its various accessories.</p>

<p>But reporting also suggests that the Switch 2 will retain backward compatibility with digital and physical Switch games, which could justify retaining some kind of backward compatibility with existing controllers. This new Joy-Con charging cradle could provide current Switch owners a way to continue charging Joy-Cons and NES controllers even if they can no longer be attached to and charged by the console itself.</p>
<p>But that's just speculation at this point. It could just as easily be the case that Nintendo has to keep the Switch going for one more holiday season, and it's eager to sell every accessory it can alongside the shrinking but still significant number of consoles it will sell between now and the time the Switch 2 is released. Nintendo recently announced new games in the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series, which will give past and future Switch buyers a reason to keep their Joy-Cons charged in the first place.</p>
<p>Nintendo has taken pains to make old controllers compatible with new consoles before. Most Nintendo Wii consoles came with built-in GameCube controller ports, which enabled backward compatibility with GameCube games and also allowed GameCube controllers to be used with compatible Wii games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>. Wii remotes also continued to function with the Wii U.</p>
<p>One thing we don't know about the Switch 2's backward compatibility is whether it will provide any kind of graphical enhancements for Switch games. Several titles released in recent years, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/nintendo-is-working-on-improvements-to-latest-pokemon-games-after-buggy-launch/">newer Pokémon titles</a>, have suffered from performance issues. Nintendo had reportedly planned to release a more powerful "Switch Pro" at some point in 2021 or 2022, but the update was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/rumour-switch-pro-was-real-but-got-cancelled-claims-digital-foundry">apparently scrapped</a> in favor of the more modestly updated OLED Switch.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced delays for Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence, its two upcoming free-to-play mobile shooters, as part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf">first-quarter earnings report</a>, which is says marks a "solid start" to the current financial year.
</p>
<p>
Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence - a 5v5 competitive FPS and third-person, open-world "shooter RPG", respectively - were both originally due to launch some time before the end of its current financial year on 31st March 2025. However, the publisher has now delayed both games out of that window to give their development teas the "necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimised KPIs in the context of a demanding yet very large market."
</p>
<p>
Both titles - which Ubisoft is referring to as "triple-A" mobile games - were announced back in 2022, and have hosted closed beta since then.
</p>

<p>
Beyond those delays, Ubisoft's latest earnings report sees the publisher in a buoyant mood, describing its Q1 results as a "solid start" to its current financial year, with net bookings "above target". CEO Yves Guillemot called the results proof the company was "on the right track" after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">disappointing results</a> for its 2022-23 year which saw the company cancel a raft of projects and adopt a strategy "increased cautiousness over the coming years".
</p>
<p>
Some of its Q1 success can be attributed to the launch of its free-to-play shooter XDefiant back in May, which Ubisoft says got off to an "encouraging" start, managing to attract 10m players in its first two weeks of release. Rainbow Six Siege is also said to have seen "very strong year-on-year growth" as far as player activity and monetisation goes, while the The Crew Motorfest has seen "solid engagement".

<p>
As for Assassin's Creed, it continues to be a big winner for Ubisoft; the series is said to have "overperformed" this quarter, with sales getting a boost from Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-gives-us-our-first-look-at-the-new-current-gen-engine">Assassin's Creed Shadows announcement</a>. The company is even reporting its critically panned pirate adventure Skull and Bones continues to "perform well" in terms of engagement and annual revenue per user. All that has led to net bookings of €290m, ahead of its €275m target. 
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, Ubisoft says it's "too early" to talk about its next financial year, but we do at least known Anno 117: Pax Romana, the next entry in its long-running strategy series, is due in 2025. Up first, though, are Star Wars Outlaws and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, launching on 30th August and 15th November respectively.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/european-game-sales-decline-by-1-9-in-first-half-of-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Compared to other places across the world, European game sales suffered the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The UK experienced a decline of 30%</a> in the first half of 2024, whereas European game sales only experienced a decrease of 1.9% in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-game-sales-down-just-16-during-the-first-half-of-2024-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Games Sales Data</a> report, 80 million games were sold across Europe in the first half of 2024 on PC and console. Compared to other parts of the world, this is a solid start to the year for Europe, as there weren't many hard-hitting games released in the first half of the year compared to 2023. For example, the first half of 2023 saw games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, and Diablo IV be released and be hugely successful right out of the gate.</p>
<p>Only two of the top ten best-selling games of 2024 were released this year: Helldivers 2 and The Last of Us: Part 2 Remastered. Compared to other big releases, these games had a lower selling price than other AAA games released in recent years, which has helped contribute to the boost in sales.</p>
<p>Looking at European game sales in June at a glance, 11.3 million video games were sold in the last month, which is a drop of 19% from June 2023. June 2023 saw some big releases, such as Diablo IV and Final Fantasy 16, which helped elevate sales massively. However, June 2024 did not see a big AAA game come through this month, which has led to a decline in sales.</p>
<p>The one huge positive for this half of the year was the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring DLC</a>. Looking at month-on-month data, sales shot up by 454% for the base game of Elden Ring alone. For the highest charted game of this half of the year, it goes to Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. However, only physical sales for this game were counted, with no data on how many digital sales the game received.</p>
<p>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD was nearly the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game this year, but it narrowly avoided the title, with Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door taking its place instead. Nintendo has had a jam-packed first half of the year, with games such as Princess Peach: Showtime and Mario vs. Donkey Kong also being released in the first half.</p>
<p>While most places have their digital and physical data tracked, Nintendo's digital data for Europe is missing, making it difficult to know if they are excelling in sales or falling behind.</p>
<p>Overall, European game sales have stayed strong for the first half of the year, with a very minimal decline compared to the UK and the US.</p>

A disillusioned junior at a law firm, Luisa packs up her bags and flees the tedium and numbness of her life for a chance at feeling <em>something </em>through the literal magic of the town of Hinterberg. And let me tell you, <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>is teeming with magic. Across 20 hours of plumbing its dungeons, meeting its townsfolk, and hiking up and down the Alps’ numerous terrains, I was <em>enchanted</em>. It isn’t without some jank, but it’s without a doubt <em>my </em>feel-good game of the year so far, and a wondrous attempt at an indie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Zelda</em></a></span>-like.<br></p><h2 id="h18976"><a id=""></a>A clean escape</h2><p>The crux of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s charm is its simplicity. At the beginning of every day, you will often have a short conversation with another character, and then embark on a journey to one of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s regions to explore a dungeon. At that point, you hike through the picturesque park (rendered in stunning pop art) looking for one of the game’s 25 dungeons, and eventually enter one. Upon its completion, you return to town where you are allowed to shop for potions, gear, and upgrades, as well as talk to some of the townsfolk and other tourists and engage with a straightforward adaptation of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540">Social Link system</a></span>. Then, you rinse and repeat.</p><p>By cutting a lot of the filler and bloat that a much bigger game might load up on, <em>Hinterberg </em>is allowed to shine a spotlight on its most honed edges, namely its titular dungeons. Each of the game’s 25 dungeons has some sort of gimmick, and though they begin simply enough, they eventually evolve into much grander fare. An early dungeon funnels you from encounter to encounter via minecart, but a much later one might become a multi-stage auto scroller on a river raft or a puzzle box with the mind-bending perspective of <em>Fez </em>or <em>Monument Valley</em>. Some of them are low on encounters in favor of puzzles (or vice-versa), but each is a mostly refreshing experience that riffs on an aesthetic, as well as a mechanic that fans of dungeon-heavy games might recognize.</p><figure id="" data-id="4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-recommend-id="image://4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot showing Luisa skating on a rail in one of Dungeons of Hinterberg’s later levels.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games / Curve Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-recommend-id="image://4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it really gets going, <em>Hinterberg</em>’s puzzling is wonderful. It is never so abstract or convoluted that you’re absolutely stumped, but it does demand focus. The solutions to puzzles are never far off, meaning you just have to think about it for more than a few seconds to piece together what’s got to be done. As someone who can be a bit of a brute, I <em>love </em>this school of puzzle design. <em>Hinterberg</em>’s puzzles are intuitive, and because many of them build off of one another to grow subtly more complex as you progress, you, too, gradually evolve, informally learning the language of its philosophy and getting to gel with it. In a lot of puzzle games, I bang my head against a wall till I triumph over it, but in <em>Hinterberg </em>it felt more like I was in sync with the puzzles and we had achieved a mutual sense of cohesion.</p><p>One way in which <em>Hinterberg </em>remains novel is by inventively playing with conventions and camera to radically change on the fly. One level might present itself as a sort of 2D platformer, another might come across as an action-RPG like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/diablo-iv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/diablo-iv"><em>Diablo</em></a></span><em> </em>complete with an isometric angle, and some of my favorite levels appear in a snow region whose various dungeons riff on the level design of <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, of all things. It even has a Lost Woods-style dungeon in the vein of <em>Zelda</em>, its chief influence, and while <em>Hinterberg </em>remains fundamentally the same through these shifts, it embraces a vivacity as it pays homage to these genres and specific games, and becomes a celebratory and triumphant pastiche of its various forebears.<br></p><p>Speaking of, though <em>Hinterberg</em>’s dungeons lean heavily into <em>Zelda </em>territory, its combat most notably cribs from <em>Dark Souls</em>, though it’s never so grueling. You have a light and heavy swing which can be woven into short and simple combos that might stagger and even topple opponents. When you’re not on the attack, though, you’ll be dodge-rolling like a motherfucker, as well as managing your stamina and MP gauge, which are tied to the use of two abilities which rotate depending on the region you’re currently in. The cherry on top are these super-effective moves called attack conduits which have cooldown timers rather than gauges, and can be swapped out at nearly any time. If this sounds pretty standard, it’s because it is, and <em>Hinterberg </em>doesn’t mess with this winning formula for the sake of player comfort. In a game brimming with novelty, it’s a little disappointing how cut-and-dry encounters grow to be.</p><h2 id="h18977"><a id=""></a>More than meets the eye</h2><p>As Luisa, who has come here to become an adventurer—known as a slayer—ventures out and talks to the townsfolk, it becomes apparent that magic isn’t all that the brochures and marketing machines have made it out to be. Magic came to Hinterberg and transformed the town, which is led by a mayor who seems hellbent on commodifying the experience and pimping it out to as many people as possible. Theresa, who runs the inn Luisa stays at, has never enjoyed more success thanks to the constant influx of tourists, but it comes at the price of the constant <em>noise</em>. Not literal noise, though a club for adventurers does exist just around the corner from the inn. Rather, the noise of gears churning beneath the surface of it all; a noise that threatens to drown out the denizens of Hinterberg who once had a say in what happens in their small town for the sake of capital.</p><p>Soon enough Luisa, who befriends various folks around town and benefits from these relationships through its social system, becomes an avatar for their collective will. As she gets to know people like the smithy Hannah, Luisa begins unraveling a conspiracy that threatens to unmake Hinterberg, whose leadership has tried to capture and sell magic. <em>Hinterberg</em>’s “coziness” disguises an uglier truth as it provides commentary on the things we aren’t willing to do and forsake for a dollar or an ounce of powermoney or influence.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-recommend-id="image://ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot of Luisa talking to Renaud, one of Dungeons of Hinterberg’s more eccentric slayers.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games / Curve Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-recommend-id="image://ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I really appreciated the nuance with which <em>Hinterberg </em>tells this story, which wound up going places I didn’t expect. The game’s very conscious of even Luisa’s role as tourist, and acknowledges how her and many of the people she meets are very much part of the problem plaguing the village. Whether it be for fame, a fantasy-fulfilling vacation, or as a way to exorcize some personal demons, everybody looks to Hinterberg and its magic to solve some ill of their own, but never really give back to the town or invest in it and its people. Instead, Luisa and her ilk come to town and <em>take</em>. If magic were real, <em>Hinterberg </em>believes there’s no way we wouldn’t abuse it, and maybe we’re better off without it. Maybe what we all need to do is take stock of our lives and the lives around us and ask how we can resolve to make things communally better, rather than looking to the divine or magical to fix it all.<br></p><h2 id="h18978"><a id=""></a>10/10, would slay again</h2><p>Despite <em>Hinterberg </em>telling me that I should confront my problems rather than run away from them, I’d happily run back to this game time and time again. The beauty of its rendition of the Alps is hard to overstate, and I was enamored by the mere act of jogging up and down its sumptuous trails. Its top-notch dungeon design only further complements what an absolute joy it was to sink into its world filled with magic. Like the best vacation spots, I can’t wait to be drawn in by <em>Hinterberg</em>’s magnetism again and revel in its luxuries for a long time to come.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
