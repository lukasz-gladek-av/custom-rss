<p>Catching Zs</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has revealed yet another new Mega 'mon arriving in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC, but more than that, it has revealed a whole new <em>type</em> of Mega Evolution.</p>
<p>Mega Lucario Z is the latest Fighting- and Steel-type Mega Evolution to join the line-up, boasting a swanky blue and yellow look as well as some particularly fetching fringe work. This marks the debut appearance of Z Mega Evolution — a new take on the mechanic that sees Pokémon able to fire off their moves quicker, but also burn through their Mega Power at a faster rate.</p>
<p>Pokémon that undergo a Z Mega Evolution might not be best suited for long battles, then, but they'll likely pose a good way for wrapping up fights with a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Here's the official rundown of Mega Lucario Z and a handful of snaps from The Pokémon Company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility. It can utilize its aura in a variety of ways, including stretching it into a shield or channeling it into physical blows by concentrating it into specific parts of its body, such as its legs or fists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mega Lucario Z will arrive with the <em>other</em> new Megas in the Legends: Z-A DLC on 10th December.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-routine-xbox-game-pass-december-2025/</link>
            <guid>1370305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/02/xbox-game-pass-december-2025/">announced the first batch</a> of Xbox Game Pass games heading to the service for the first half of December, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Lunar Software's ROUTINE headlining the games this month. And while most months are about the new games joining the service, December's lineup is also about games already on the service becoming available to players at the lower-level Premium and Essential tiers.</p>



<p>Starting with the new games, ROUTINE and Death Howl are the two titles entering the service this month that are day one releases into Xbox Game Pass. The former is a game that some people <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">have been waiting for over a decade for, after it was initially announced back in Gamescom 2012</a>. The latter is a Soulslike deck builder. </p>



<p>Mortal Kombat 1 is the big triple-A addition this month, though it's also a direct series trade, because as this game enters the service, Mortal Kombat 11 will exit the service as of December 15. You could even make the point that ROUTINE is another like-for-like trade, because while it joins the service, Still Wakes the Deep also exits on December 15.</p>



<p>As far as what's becoming available to more than just players paying for Game Pass Ultimate, the big headlining title is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Of course, it was already on Game Pass, but it was only available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Now, it's available to players paying for the middle-tier Premium Game Pass subscription, along with 33 Immortals, which is still currently in a 'game preview' state on Game Pass.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, World War Z, Stellaris, and Medieval Dynasty are all now available at the base-level Essential Game Pass tier. Lastly, a small additional note on this month's Game Pass announcements is that Xbox has started to identify games that are optimized for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds</a> in these Xbox Wire posts. </p>



<p>It'll now list "<em>Handheld</em>" as an available platform for a game, which is a good indicator, even if in reality all of the games available on PC Game Pass are available on the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games for the first half of December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage - December 2 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monster Train 2 - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Spray Paint Simulator - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>World War Z: Aftermath - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>Stellaris - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>Medieval Dynasty - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>33 Immortals - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>ROUTINE - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Console, Handheld - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>A Game About Digging A Hole - December 9 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Death Howl - December 9 - PC, Handheld - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Dome Keeper - December 9 - PC, Cloud, Console, Handheld - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 1 - December 10 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Bratz: Rhythm and Style - December 11 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as what is leaving the service, as previously mentioned, Mortal Kombat 11 and Still Wakes the Deep will exit on December 15, along with Wildfrost. Following that, on December 31, Hell Let Loose and Carrion will also leave the service.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that this batch of games takes us all the way to December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">which is also the day of The Game Awards</a>. Perhaps that's because Xbox will be announcing and shadow-dropping a new title on Game Pass that day. We'll see how that develops.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop’s Pokémon Card Loot Box Program Just Led To A Record-Breaking $30,000 Trade-In]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582</link>
            <guid>1370302</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holographic Gengar from the Pokémon TCG set Skyridge just fetched over $30,000 at GameStop. The company is touting it as an own aimed at all the “<a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1995625203460891061/photo/1">trolls</a>” who make fun of its infamously poor trade-in values. But the record-breaking deal is really a window into one of the meme stock retailer’s slimy new loot box idea: trading card Power Packs.</p> <p>Pokémon cards are a giant cash cow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalpers-tcg-gamestop-weigh-scale-lifetime-ban-2000646859">Scalpers raid GameStop</a> stores multiple times a month to buy up all the new products that the Pokémon Company can’t print fast enough. But GameStop barely makes any profit off of those sales. It can’t just print its own Pokémon cards and start selling them either. So it’s done the next best thing. It’s started opening its own packs and reselling the rarest cards as part of Power Packs which are effectively digital slot machines.</p>

 <p>To participate, customers set up Stripe accounts, select the Power Pack they want, and then watch to see what card they get. The program is done in partnership with Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), so all of the cards are graded and slabbed. While the average value of a pack might be $100, most cards people get will be worth less than what they paid for the virtual blind box.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was offered $30 for RDR2 8 days after it came out and my 100k reward points I had saved up for years were not restored when my auto renew membership was turned off from an update despite being a member for 15 years. Never forget <a href="https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0">https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0</a></p> <p>— Nathan 🗡️ (@DistantGalaxy96) <a href="https://twitter.com/DistantGalaxy96/status/1995646241313882496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>GameStop promises to buy-back any cards players don’t want at 90 percent of “fair market value” minus a 6 percent commission. That commission is essentially GameStop’s cut since PSA also runs it’s own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeInvesting/comments/1okzzky/psa_buying_back_their_own_slabs/">90 percent buyback program</a> without the fee. Some folks think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcgcollections/comments/1nqagls/scammy_move_by_gamestop_powerpack_please_read_if/">it’s a rip-off</a>. Supporters who are still banking on “GameStop to the moon” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1mdyr9e/the_genius_buyback_system_behind_gamestops_new/">think it’s genius</a>.</p>

 <p>This new system is how one Pokémon card collector found a PSA 10 Holo Gengar worth an estimated $33,883 in their Power Pack. They decided to sell it back to GameStop for $30,494.70. It’s still listed as a Power Pack high-value card for someone else to chase now.</p>

 <h2>From GameStop to “Cardstop”</h2> <p>GameStop gets to promote the exchange as “the most valuable single trade-in ever recorded in GameStop history” even though the amount is contractually obligated through a completely separate program then the one people use to trade-in retro games, old controllers, and last year’s <em>Madden</em> for a fraction of their original sale value.</p>

 <p>“I did get the chase card, I decided to sell it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSAPowerPacks/comments/1pbp6wr/comment/nrtpgwd/?context=3">wrote</a> user Fredflinstone00 on the Power Pack subreddit. “I purchased (2) of the $2,500 packs, I was able to sell my cards from each pack and pulled the Gengar on the 6th pack.” They said they’re getting about $28,000 after fees, which puts them up overall after being down $4,000 before the Gengar.</p>

 <p>“I just sell the cards I dont want and keep the ones I do want, I’ve had plenty shipped to me,” they told the community on Reddit. “With this card, the sales history is not the greatest, don’t want to risk a $10k move downwards, so I took the payout.”</p> <p>That volatility is another one of the risks with Power Packs. The Gengar in question was only selling for around $5,000 as recently as 2023 and GameStop’s estimated market value matched the <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-skyridge/gengar-h9#completed-auctions-manual-only">highest known sale</a> of the card from back in October.</p> <p>Others cash out the minute they get a chase card as well. A couple weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPies662/" aria-label="Author: SnooPies662" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false">SnooPies662</a> snagged a PSA 10 Blaine’s Charizard worth $13,700. “Subsidized by my gf after losing 6k total on diamonds,” they wrote. “Safe to say I’m done forever now and achieved everything I could have possibly wanted from this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Is Giving An Old Favorite A Second Mega Evolution]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602</link>
            <guid>1370296</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Lucario is one of Game Freak’s favorite Pokémon and has long been one of the faces for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a> since the powered-up transformations debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Now, the steel/fighting-type monster is getting another Mega form called Mega Lucario Z as part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i></a><span>DLC.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega_lucario_z"><span>According to the official </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> website</span></a><span>, these Mega Evolution Z forms will play a little differently than their standard transformations, as they will have shorter cooldown times for their attacks, but use more of the Mega Gauge that lets them sustain their transformations. They hit faster, but use fewer moves before reverting to their original forms, so Game Freak says they’re less suited for longer battles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mega Lucario Z doesn’t change the Pokémon’s steel/fighting typing, so it will be interesting to see how it differentiates itself from the original Mega Lucario in the competitive space. The fact that Z forms have their own special mechanic makes it sound like other Pokémon will be getting these alternate forms. This lines up with some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined leaks from earlier this year</a> that claim Absol and Garchomp are also getting these new transformations in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Lucario isn’t the only old favorite getting a new Mega Evolution in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC, which is also adding two forms for Raichu, and new transformations for Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-zeraora-reaction-industry-plant-2000645789">Zeraora</a>. Outside of new Megas, the expansion is also adding a roguelike mode that will <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">break the series’ original level 100 cap</a>, so it could be one of the biggest challenges these games have offered to date. It does seem to take place <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-korrina-lucario-az-galar-how-to-get-2000639831">after the events of the main game</a>, though, so if you haven’t beaten <em>Legends: Z-A </em>yet, you might want to lock in. The expansion will launch next week on December 10.</span></p>

<p>Discord is rolling out a new commerce experience for users and has partnered with Marvel Rivals as the first title with integrated shopping and gifting.</p>



<p>Launching just in time for the Marvel Rivals anniversary celebrations and the holiday season, players in the Marvel Rivals Discord will be able to browse and purchase digital goods within the Marvel Rivals Discord.</p>











<figure><figcaption>New feature. Image via Discord</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players in the Marvel Rivals Discord can now create a wishlist of the items they want to add to their collection and gift in-game items to their friends, with purchased and gifted items instantly accessible within Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-introduces-a-new-commerce-experience-for-gaming-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord says</a> the integration is a huge boost for players and developers alike, as gifting isn’t limited to players of the game, so items can be gifted to friends to encourage them to jump into the game, extending in-game currency, and building upon the existing gifting behavior on Discord.</p>



<p>It’s added that 20% of all Shop purchases on Discord are gifts, a number that increases to almost 30% during the holiday season, so the integration is described as “a natural evolution of how people use Discord to connect and celebrate together.”</p>



<p>Initially, the integration will support purchases in USD only on the Discord desktop client, though players from the US, Canada, Ireland, and Oceania will be able to use it. Additional regions and platform support will be explored in the future, Discord says.</p>



<p>Additional game support is expected to be added in the future as part of the feature’s evolution.</p>

<p>The path to Mega Mewtwo starts here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As a part of today's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC news, The Pokémon Company revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legends: Z-A</a>'s next Mystery Gift Code event, and it's not one to be missed.</p>
<p>The event is live in-game right now. All that you need to do is head to the 'Mystery Gift' menu and select 'Receive via Internet' to get involved. Right off the bat, you'll be rewarded with special Mewtwonite X &amp; Y Mega Stones, and you'll also unlock the new 'Project M' side mission, which sets you on the path to catch — you guessed it — Mewtwo!</p>
<p>You need to have rolled credits to access the gift, but no end date has been revealed for the event at the time of writing, so you've got plenty of time to get there if you're still exploring Lumiose at your leisure.</p>
<p>And yes, while the news was broken in today's Mega Dimension dump, the event is available for <em>everyone with the base game</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242</link>
            <guid>1370266</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, a new sci-fi horror game launching on Xbox and PC on December 4, that I won’t forget for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>To explain this moment and why it is burned into my brain would involve spoilers, but suffice it to say, in a game that rarely relies on jump scares, this moment</span> <span>was so perfectly crafted that it caught me completely off guard. So much so that I found my hands shaking a bit. And with no pause button, all I could do in the game was slide into a corner of the room and try to collect myself. So yeah, if you don’t like scary games, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>ain’t for you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a spooky first-person horror game set in an alternate future where humanity made it to the Moon and partially colonized it sometime in the 1980s. This means a lot of the technology you’ll encounter during </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>six to seven-hour story feels dated, mechanical, and retro. Old CRTs and ’80s-era computers are everywhere, offering up some</span><i><span> Alien Isolation </span></i><span>vibes, which I didn’t mind at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Buttons and doodads and switches</b></h2> <p><span>This retro sci-fi aesthetic includes your trusty Cosmonaut Assistance Tool or CAT, which you acquire right at the start of the game as your character arrives at the now-abandoned moonbase to make repairs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part computer, part camera, and part gun, the CAT features switches and modes that must be activated by fumbling around with it. It’s designed to be a clunky way to save your game, unlock doors, and scan equipment. And it makes even something as simple as swapping to a different mode a scary moment where you have to stop looking around and focus on your CAT to find the right switch. It’s one of many ways </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>uses clunky mechanics to add tension.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649247">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>also hides items and pieces of information in hard-to-reach spots, forcing you to stretch up or bend down using a few extra buttons. Like operating the CAT, this isn’t hard to do, but it does become far trickier to interact with this world using these deliberately clunky methods when a killer robot is quickly approaching.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And yeah, as you might have guessed, you aren’t alone on the moon. Pretty quickly after arriving, killer robots become a problem. They dot the hallways and rooms of the deteriorating moonbase, just waiting to spot you and take chase. And while you can stun them with your CAT, it’s a brief delay and not a viable strategy for survival. Stealth is much more effective, though panic-running to the game’s few safe areas also works, too. Don’t ask me how I know.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Expect the unexpected</b></h2> <p><span>The thing is, there’s… more to </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>beyond what I’ve already mentioned. Obstensibly, as seen in all the pre-release gameplay footage of </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, this is a creepy sci-fi game built around trying to repair a moonbase that features once-docile robots who are now deadly machines determined to find you and snap your neck. That’s not all </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is, but to spoil any more would be a crime. Just know that the second half of this game ratchets up the horror and goes in a direction I wasn’t expecting.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Moon’s haunted.” </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Lunar Software</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Photorealistic first-person sci-fi survival game</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous graphics, creepy vibes, mechanical controls, wonderful second-half swerve  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some annoying puzzles, ending is a bit meh</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), Xbox One, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the game’s story in about 6 hours. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>I appreciated the swerve that occurs in </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>second half. Up until that point, I found </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>to be a solid </span><i><span>Alien Isolatio</span></i><span>n-like experience, but nothing too remarkable. But by the end, after it zigs and zags, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>had fully escaped </span><i><span>Isolation’s </span></i><span>shadow, becoming its own worthwhile horror game and scared the shit out of me in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And while I can’t say much about the second half, I can gush about </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>visuals. This is one of the best-looking video games I’ve played this console generation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Looks that kill, puzzles that annoy</b></h2> <p><span>At times, the derelict environments of </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>look photorealistic. Lighting and texture detail, in particular, are astonishing. At one point, I was hiding and shaking behind a large piece of machinery and spotted a detailed warning label with scratch marks. It almost distracted me from how scared I was at that moment. Almost. What actually ruined the creepy vibes were some of </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>annoying puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, some of these threw me for a loop and led to a lot of random backtracking. The game’s total lack of UI is an immersive choice, but it did lead to some moments where I ran into a brick wall and struggled to move forward. If you play </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, don’t feel bad if you have to look up a few puzzle solutions. Many of these just get in the way of a truly scary experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000649245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649245"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649245">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At least I got to backtrack through some haunting photorealistic environments. These spaces and mundane objects in them provide a perfect backdrop for<em> Routine’s</em> horrific elements. It is genuinely unnerving to be in a hyper-realistic kitchen and turn around to spot an evil robot just a few feet away. And </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>loves to use its environments, which are filled with wonderful sound design as well, to build up tension and dread.&nbsp;</span><span>There were times when the simple act of moving from one doorway to another felt like the scariest thing I’ve done in a video game. I might not have even been in danger, but I was shook.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>was announced over a decade ago at this point. So was it worth the wait? Hard to say, as I wasn’t waiting for it, but I can confirm that a decade after it was first revealed, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a damn fine horror game that stands toe to toe with other heavy hitters of the genre.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We know Hideo Kojima, the creative lead behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i><span>Metal Gear Solid</span></i></a><span>, loves movies. The guy even says in his Twitter bio that “70% of [his] body is made of movies.” However, Kojima doesn’t often get to play characters in movies. He’s only had a handful of acting credits over the years. But he’s <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1995746201720029486?s=20">adding one more to his filmography this year</a>: he’ll be playing a character in the Japanese dub of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Paul Molebrandt only has a few lines in Disney’s sequel, but the IT guy in the Zootopia Police Department office does pave the way for some pretty good scenes. </span><i><span>Zootopia</span></i><span>, its sequel, and the </span><i><span>Zootopia+ </span></i><span>mini-series play around a lot with the titular city’s shared space between multiple, differently-sized animals.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649594" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649594"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649594">© Disney</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As a mole, Paul is much smaller than most of Zootopia 2’s main cast, and his few scenes really play around with that juxtaposition, so even when he’s not speaking, he’s giving the movie a lot of humorous space to work in. Kojima may not say much in the movie, but his character makes an impact in just a few short scenes. The role began with Josh Gad in the English original, who is best known in the Disney space for playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/frozen-olaf-character-roams-disney-parks-2026-2000647055"><span>Olaf in the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is out here in the States, but the Japanese dub will enter theaters overseas on Friday, December 5. The sequel has already been a smash hit for Disney, having already passed half a billion at the box office in just one week, and the post-credits scene has big implications for a potential third movie that will probably come out sometime in the 2030s. So, hey, Kojima might reprise the role of Paul in the inevitable </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>Japanese dub. Surely we’ll have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-trailer-horror-2000627883"><i><span>OD</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><i><span>Physint</span></i></a><span> by then, right?</span></p>

        <p>Z Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Lucario Z, need less time to fire off moves but burn through Mega Power very quickly, making them less suited for long battles but a good option when trying to settle matches as fast as possible.</p><p>While Mega Lucario, the Mega Evolution of Lucario, appears in <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, the newly discovered Mega Lucario Z will appear in the downloadable content “Mega Dimension.”​</p><p><strong>Extra Side Mission Now Availalbe</strong></p><p>Starting today, Trainers can receive a Mewtwonite X stone and a Mewtwonite Y stone through the <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery Gift feature in <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>and <em><a title="Games > Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokemon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a></em>. Once the player receives the Mewtwonite X and Mewtwonite Y stones, Mewtwo’s extra side mission will become available.

Discord cofounder and chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy tells <em>The Verge</em> that it’s the wishlist and gifting aspect of the new store that offers the most opportunity to both the platform and game developers.</p><p>“On any single day, 20 percent of purchases are gifts,” he said, talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981434/discords-in-app-shop-is-now-available-to-everyone">Discord’s current shop</a> that sells cosmetics to zhuzh up user profiles. “And on holidays, it can spike to way over 30 percent.” With these new store features, the team saw an opportunity to let users extend that generosity beyond Discord-specific borders. Discord also has the opportunity to take a cut of the purchases but did not disclose the specifics of how that revenue will be split. Vishnevskiy said that the goal is to provide incremental revenue and value to developers. “We’re not ultimately just taking a cut for something,” he said.</p><p>That value comes in making the purchasing experience simple and seamless while adding the potential for new player acquisition. Vishnevskiy said that buying items for yourself within <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is fairly straightforward, but it can be tedious trying to buy for someone else and impossible, outside of gift cards, if you don’t already play the game. “We all have friends that play games that we don’t play, and they love things that we don’t always love,” Vishnevskiy said. “This gives an opportunity for a game developer to reach the friends of people that could now potentially be customers.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A mockup of what the </em>Marvel Rivals <em>store will look like in Discord.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Discord</cite></span></p></section><p>The shop is available in US currency and only on the desktop app, but Vishnevskiy said that bringing the offering to consoles and mobile is “top of mind” for the team. As for why the feature started with <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, Vishnevskiy says it was a natural fit. “They have the largest gaming server on Discord, with over 4 million people that they constantly run events with and make reasons [for players] to show up.”</p><p>But while <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is the only game that has this feature right now, it won’t only be the big AAA games and publishers able to take advantage of this program. Vishnevskiy spoke about Discord’s introduction of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758146/discord-now-lets-developers-add-chat-and-social-features-right-into-their-games">social SDK earlier this year</a>, which lets developers of all sizes integrate chat and other social features into their games. He said Discord’s in-game shop plan will follow the same route. “We’re starting with more AAA games, but our intent is to make sure this is available long term beyond them,” Vishnevskiy said.</p><p>In the current media landscape, media and gaming platforms are experimenting with ways <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794923/meta-facebook-tiktok-reels-friend-bubble">to keep people engaged</a> for longer to monopolize and thereby <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/711304/instagram-enshitification">monetize their attention to varying degrees of success and</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791595/instagram-uploading-features-content">user irritation</a>. According to Vishnevskiy, this new feature isn’t designed to keep people on the Discord wheel, but something he says will enhance the already meaningful experiences players have on the platform. “Telling people, ‘Hey, your friend loves this game and they love this character, and if it’s their birthday, they would appreciate this.’ It’s something uniquely Discord can do,” he said.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/835385/discord-shop-marvel-rivals-gifting-wishlist]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1370215</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>December is here and both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are in the rearview mirror. If you missed your shot at purchasing some holiday gifts during the biggest sales event of the year, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some deals are still active and attractive for late shoppers like us. One such deal is on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the true wireless Bluetooth earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Normally priced at $250, these earbuds are currently available for just $140—a whole $110 in savings, thanks to a 44% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are designed to be the most comfortable in-ear headphones the brand has created yet, ideal for all-day wear. Each pair comes with a sleek charging case, a USB-C charging cable, and three sets of ear tips in various sizes to ensure the best possible fit. This thoughtful design ensures the earbuds stay in place, delivering crisp, clear sound every time you use them. Whether you’re running errands, working out, or just relaxing, these earbuds should stay securely in your ears.</p>
<h2>Advanced Noise Cancellation and Custom Sound</h2>
<p>With ANC support the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 3 can automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment. You can enjoy your music, podcasts, or audiobooks without being disturbed by the surrounding noise like the noisy chatter of a crowded office or the loud hum of an airplane engine.</p>
<p>Sound quality is exceptional, with the dual amplifier and enhanced two-way speaker working in harmony. The adaptive equalizer customizes the audio to your unique ear shape, delivering a personalized sound experience. If you decide to connect them to your TV, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer an immersive 360-degree sound experience, providing a surround sound effect without the need for bulky speakers or expensive equipment.</p>
<p>With convenient touch controls, you can easily pause your music, skip tracks, answer calls, and more—all without needing to take your phone out of your pocket.</p>



<h2>Real-Time Translation with Galaxy AI</h2>
<p>One of the more unique new features of these earbuds this specific integration&nbsp; it has with Galaxy AI. The Galaxy Buds Pro 3 allow you to have real-time, face-to-face conversations in multiple languages—no translation app required. It’s a sci-fi wonder straight out of The <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. </em>When someone says “Hola” to you, the earbuds instantly translate it to “Hello” in your ear. This makes communicating while traveling a breeze. It does require being paired with a Samsung device to function. Sorry iPhone users.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro come in two stylish color choices: silver and white. Both have come down in price for Cyber Week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">They’re usually selling on Amazon for $250, but the 44% discount brings the price tag to just $150 for a limited time. You end up saving yourself $110.</a></p>

The Metal Gear series is part of videogame history, spanning pixel art to cinematic presentation, and so each title requires a different approach to expressing and remaking it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We won’t apply the methodology used to make the recent MGS Delta to all other games in the series — rather we intend to find the best approach for each specific game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamura also touched on the amount of time it took for the team at Konami to be in a position to remake Metal Gear Solid 3. “Most of the original staff members had left and the team had been reorganized, however we gathered people together and finally arrived at the point where we could make MGS Delta. As a team, we are confident that we achieved a level of quality that not only preserves the appeal of the original but also that modern players could enjoy. We are currently working out concrete plans for what we are going to do next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, when asked about the possibility of a Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots remake, Okamura remained cautious, saying: “the hardware back then required very specific designs to get the most out of the 3D technology that was available at the time, so MGS4 ended up with some pretty unique code. It seems like it would be quite a challenge to bring that into the present day.” </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Kojima Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, 2008’s Metal Gear Solid 4, which ties up all the loose ends in Solid Snake’s story, is only playable on PlayStation 3.

The way the internet works is being reshaped, too, with the idea of fair use of content for the training of AI models at loggerheads with copyright protection. This has resulted in ongoing lawsuits. Disney and Universal, for example, have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/gettyimages-2237848702-1764673388048.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser believes AI will eventually eat itself. Photo by Chelsea Guglielmino/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Dan Houser, who left Rockstar in 2020 to found Absurd Ventures having worked on pretty much all the studio’s games up to that point. His new novel, A Better Paradise, is a story that revolves around AI, and so it stands to reason that he would be asked about the tech in a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/d4RTTcvFxJU?si=3rw5DLWLXvhGrG7D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virgin Radio UK</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Houser is sceptical about the future of AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity or whatever it is, using AI, are not the most humane or creative people,” he said. “So they're sort of saying we're better at being human than you are.

For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li><li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li></ul></li><li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats.

However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed.

            <p>The original Sonic the Hedgehog game was "terribly controversial" at Sega, according to PlayStation's Mark Cerny, who's detailed more on its development in a new interview.</p>
<p>Cerny was lead system architect for Sony's PS4 and PS5 consoles, but began his career at Atari before moving to Sega and founding its Sega Technical Institute in America. It's this team that developed the sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, after the original game was made in Japan.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Sonic the Hedgehog, it was "obvious that game was going to do great," Cerny told journalist Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/mark-cerny-lead-system-architect-playstation-4-5">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Was there pressure to find a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario? "The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies," Cerny replied, before describing the game as "terribly controversial" due to the increase in resources focused on the game, which ultimately led to Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka's departure from Sega.</p><p>"Part of the idea there was…Let's put much more resource on this project than we usually do," said Cerny. "As I said, what's usual? Three people, three months. So they were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, ten months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months. I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly by putting in a couple of engineers on this that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at and quit the company."</p>
<p>Cerny admitted "it pays off fantastically well for Sega" due to the success of the game. "But Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." Cerny described Naka as a "top level creator making $60,000 [after a bonus] in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it."</p>
<p>Famously, development on the Sonic series after the success of the first game was split. Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 moved to the Sega Technical Institute in America founded by Cerny and included original developers Naka and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. Meanwhile in Japan, another Sonic game was developed by original co-creator Naoto Ohshima intended to be a sequel, but ultimately became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-cd">Sonic CD</a>.</p>
<p>Cerny noted "nobody realised how big Sonic was going to be" in either Sega Japan or America. "Sonic ships and almost immediately I've got the team ready to work on a sequel and do you want a sequel? And I've got Sega of America saying no, it's much too soon. Do a different game first," he said.</p>
<p>That soon changed following sales of Sonic the Hedgehog over its first Christmas period, quickly leading to the sequel's development by STI.</p>
<p>Cerny described his time at Sega overall as "brutal". "Atari was great, Sega was difficult," he said. "It was a difficult environment with a hard-driving president who was going to force us to success. That isn't to say that there wasn't an incredible amount of cameraderie with the people that I worked with but it was just brutal. Nakayama [president of Sega Japan] would come in and he would just give it to us if he didn't see happening what he wanted to see."</p>
<p>"Getting out of Sega was a very healthy thing," he said, before adding "Nakayama is amazing. He understood games like nobody's business...It's just that working for Nakayama - that was difficult and seven years of that was enough."</p>
<p>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has since had something of a fall from grace. After eventually leaving Sega in 2006, he later developed Balan Wonderworld with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> which was considered a critical and commercial flop on its release in 2021. He soon left the company and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-was-removed-as-director-of-balan-wonderworld-before-disastrous-launch">accused Square Enix of removing him as director six months before its launch</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-reportedly-arrested-for-insider-trading">arrested for insider trading at Square Enix</a>, which led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-receives-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">suspended prison sentence</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-developer-boasts-98-percent-cheat-free-matches-launch-week/</link>
            <guid>1370182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The development team behind Battlefield 6, collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a detailed update</a> on how their kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system has been performing in combating cheats in the popular first-person military shooter game.</p>



<p>According to data gathered by the developers, Javelin ensured that roughly 98% of online Battlefield 6 matches in the game's launch week were effectively cheat-free. This means there was only a 2% 'Match Infection Rate', an admittedly nebulous data point that the developers describe as the chance that players would encounter a cheater in their matches. </p>



<p>The 98% rate was attributed mainly to the improvements made during the Open Beta weekend. At first, 'only' 93.1% of the matches were cheat-free, but that figure was raised to almost 98% by the final day after blocking over 1.2 million cheat attempts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing tens of thousands of cheaters</a>. Secure Boot adoption had increased from 62.5% to 92.5%, as well.</p>



<p>During the launch weekend of Battlefield 6, Javelin prevented over 367K cheating attempts. That's fewer than during comparable Open Beta weekends, but it's consistent with the current number of cheating developers the developers had tracking. To date, this figure has grown to 2.39 million blocked cheat attempts. Battlefield Studios is currently aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, resellers, and their associated communities. Since launch, 183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely.</p>



<p>That doesn't mean the fight against Battlefield 6 cheats is over. Beyond the requirement of Secure Boot, developers are exploring additional features already available at the operating system level, such as HVCI (Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity) and VBS (Virtualization-Based Security). Furthermore, they will continue to work with console partners to ban cheating hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as the Cronus Zen</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 just ended <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its free multiplayer trial event</a>. The game is about to receive its Winter Offensive update in a week. Winter Offensive will add a new map, mode and weapon; players will roam the streets of Brooklyn with below freezing temperatures, forced to seek Heat Zones to prevent health drain in the limited-time Ice Lock event, battle other teams in the limited-time Ice Lock Gauntlet variant, and unlock the new Ice Climbing Melee Axe.</p>

The rapper has Agent 47 take down his blonde alter-ego Slim Shady, it's all very meta and a tad less appealing to me than the cameos previously made by the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitmans-latest-free-elusive-target-mission-makes-you-bruce-lees-bodyguard-and-is-out-now">Bruce Lee</a> and Mads Mikkelsen as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">Bond villain Le Chiffre</a>.</p>
<p>That said, a new interview some IO Interactive folks have given to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>, in which boss Hakan Abrak makes clear there will be a new Hitman coming once the studio have gotten some stuff off their plate, has caught my attention by contrasting Mr Nem with murderbald handler Diana.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, let's get the next Hitman stuff out of the way. "So of course there will be more Hitman," Abrak said when asked if there'll be more hitmen now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>'s morphed in catch-all basket World of Assassination. "But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman — because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>IO, of course, also have Bond game 007 First Light to put out soon, with a new fantasy game unimaginatively codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-fantasy">Project Fantasy</a> also mentioned here as being in the wings. As for what this next Hitman might look like, lead level designer Jacob Mikkelsen simply said he doesn't regret any of the paths the series has gone down to this point, citing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> as the most out-there entry, but still as a game that taught the studio valuable lessons.</p><p>Speaking of valuable lessons, here's the bit in the interview which makes me regret not having immediately been down to give Agent 47's Eminem mission a go the moment I saw it was a thing. The rapper acts as a handler helping guide barcode man to Shady, and I'd not thought about how that'd allow the devs to play him off of the most Eminem-coded character in Hitman canon. "There’s some interchanges between Eminem and [usual 47 bossperson] Diana [Burnwood] that are really fun," according to writer Jen Simpkins. "Because, as you know, Diana is a very different character to Eminem. And it’s a very surreal level where there’s a lot of reality blending and mixing into one."</p>
<p>Personally, I can see the pair really getting along. Diana seems like she'd appreciate the sort of dedication and practice which goes into nailing that one really fast verse in Rap God, while Eminem seems like the kind of guy to understand the sort of care and adroitness it takes to navigate shadowy multinational murder conspiracies while you've got a very narrow margin for error. After all, he is master of all that's shady and slim.</p>
<p>Those two should helm Hitman 4 if 47 opts to hang up his piano wire in the interim. The Eminem mission is available in World of Assassination until December 31st, so if you fancy trying it, you've got plenty of time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-oled-with-joy-con-falls-to-a-clearance-level-low-as-amazon-has-only-limited-grade-a-renewed-units-left-2000649255</link>
            <guid>1370173</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo recently launched the much-anticipated successor to its highly successful Nintendo Switch console earlier this summer. For those looking to upgrade, the new Nintendo Switch 2 is available this holiday season for $450. However, if you missed out on the original Switch, or if you’re not in a rush to adopt the latest version, picking up a previous model could be a smart choice. Currently, Amazon is offering a refurbished model of the Nintendo Switch OLED at a massive discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">Going refurbished over new, normally will save you about $40 ($360 versus $400). However, right now for Cyber Week, the price has come down to just $310</a>. You end up saving $75 wen compared to buying the Switch OLED new, and you can join the Nintendo ecosystem for $171 less than you’d pay buying a brand new Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch debuted way back in 2017, Nintendo did release updated hardware between then and now with the Nintendo Switch OLED arriving in 2021. This mid-generation upgrade brought substantial improvements over the original version. The most notable change is the 7-inch OLED screen, which delivers brighter, more vivid visuals, especially noticeable in games with prevalent deep blacks like <em>Metroid Dread</em>—a title that launched alongside the OLED model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED vs. Switch 2</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the new Switch 2 doesn’t feature an OLED display. Instead, it uses an LCD screen with HDR, which represents an improvement over the standard LCD technology on the launch model Switch but still can’t match the color richness and depth of OLED. This decision seems to be a cost-saving measure by Nintendo, and they likely aim to release a Switch 2 with an OLED screen in the future. As it stands now, certain games actually look better on the OLED model compared to the Switch 2 due to the superior display.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Nintendo Switch OLED still holds an advantage. The Switch 2 offers between 2 to 6.5 hours of battery life depending on the intensity of the games you play. In contrast, the Switch OLED lasts anywhere between 4.5 to 9 hours, providing a more reliable portable gaming experience. Though the Switch 2 comes with a larger 5220mAh battery (compared to the Switch OLED’s 4310mAh), the bigger screen and higher resolution (1080p handheld) cause the Switch 2 to drain its battery more quickly than the OLED model.</p>



<h2>Game Library</h2>
<p>If you’re drawn to the new Nintendo Switch 2 because of its shiny new titles like <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you’re in for some fun, but beyond those there’s a just a couple new releases that dropped in time for the holiday. All and all, the first-year lineup of games is still somewhat limited. You might find that there’s no immediate need to jump to the newest generation just yet, especially with the vast selection of games already available on the original Switch.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch has a well-established library, with fan-favorites like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> still being some of the best titles in gaming. Furthermore, the original Switch is packed with incredible indie games, such as <em>Celeste</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and<em> Hades</em>, which can each on their own keep your attention for hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether the Switch OLED or the Switch 2 is the right choice for you depends on your priorities. If you’re looking for an excellent value and don’t mind going with a model that’s a couple of years old, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers great performance, stunning handheld visuals, and longer battery life. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">You can grab one now for just $310</a>. Then maybe we just hold out for Nintendo to eventually release a Nintendo Switch 2 OLED in a few years.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Survive Wave Z monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Scrap and much more.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the classic multiplayer Call Of Duty game mode Zombies? If so, Survive Wave Z is going to be right up your alley, and you need to check out this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-ants-empire-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> wave defence experience immediately. As the name of the game suggests, players are tasked with defending and surviving against endless waves of enemies, with the end goal being to survive Wave Z, which is considered the last one. There is a wide variety of weapons and other items that the players can use in their mission to survive, but not all of them will be available for use at the start of the game.</p>







<p>As is the case with most games of this genre, unlocking powerful weapons required a massive amount of grinding, and for players who are new to the game, acquiring some of these can seem like a pipe dream. That’s where these codes can come to the players’ aid. They provide free rewards to the players, including key resources like Scrap, making it a key part of the game. Redeeming these codes will help players get ahead of the competition and progress through the levels faster than they otherwise would be able to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-survive-wave-z-codes">Expired Survive Wave Z Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Survive Wave Z, as the game only came out quite recently. The one active code given above is the only one that has been released by the developers so far. However, with the game’s increasing popularity, new codes are likely on the horizon. As soon as any of the active codes expire, they will be moved to this section of the page.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Survive Wave Z is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. There are no prerequisite steps, making it a very beginner-friendly process. For players who are new to the Roblox, however, here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Survive Wave Z.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button at the top of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the Submit button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p>New Roblox game codes are often released by the developers through the game’s official Discord server, through the Roblox game page, or on their social media pages. However, tracking all of these regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this article can be a lifesaver. We update this page with new codes as soon as they drop, so we recommend that all players bookmark this page to not miss out on any free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion has soared onto the scene, with the beat ’em up title boasting an impressive roster of characters, including several that are locked behind progression.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-a-cosmic-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a ‘Great’ verdict of the game was issued, with the title attracting praise for providing chaotic gameplay in a good way, with a perfect balance of depth to keep players engaged, but not overwhelmed, in the vintage beat ’em up.</p>



<p>If you’re diving into Marvel Cosmic Invasion but want to know how to unlock a specific character, or are wondering who there is to choose from on the roster, this guide has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-amp-how-to-unlock">All Marvel Cosmic Invasion Characters &amp; How to Unlock</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Tribute Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 15 playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, four of which are locked behind specific requirements in progression.</strong></p>



<p>The base roster in Marvel Cosmic Invasion is kind, with 11 characters unlocked by default, including fan-favorites like Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p>However, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Venom, Phyla-Vell, and Silver Surfer must be unlocked by completing specified missions, which require exploring several areas of the game as split paths present themselves regularly. Due to this, you won’t be able to unlock all the characters immediately, and will have to backtrack at some points.</p>



<p>The challenge of unlocking the restricted characters is not difficult, however, as you only need to complete the specified levels, and don’t need to achieve any particular objectives, though this means potentially venturing out of your way to the four individual levels containing the locked characters.</p>



<p>The full list of playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion and how to unlock them is shown in the table below.</p>

            <p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> may have its sights currently set on the upcoming James Bond origin story 007 First Light, but that doesn't mean we have seen the last of the studio's Hitman series.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>,  IO Interactive's head Hakan Abrak assured fellow Agent 47 fans that "of course" there will be more Hitman in the future. Exactly how far in the future, though, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>
