            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-we-know-about-making-of-original-dungeons-dragons-1970-1977<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2024 continues to be a massive year for <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. With the recent release of the level 10-20 adventure, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a>, and the upcoming Core Rulebook updates on the way there's one more book from Wizards of the Coast releasing; <em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike other releases, this isn't an Adventure or Sourcebook but instead is a celebration of the creation and development of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> on it's 50th anniversary.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago we had a chance to sit down and hear from those involved in the creation of the book including Jason Tondro, Senior Game Designer, and Jon Peterson, D&amp;D Historian and the Author of this book.</p>



<p><em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em> will be releasing on June 18th, 2024 and will be available for $99.99. This book will be 576 pages long, roughly one and a half times as large as a normal <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> adventure if that's the best reference you have to picture it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There are a lot of books that tell people how <em>D&amp;D</em> was made, but what we wanted to do with this book was show it to you instead"<br>
- Jason Tondro, Senior Game Designer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tondro explained that the book sis separated into four different sections; Precursors, The 1973 Draft of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and Articles &amp; Additions. This path is meant to illustrate what kinds of Pen &amp; Paper RPGs were already in the space and influencing Gary Gygax, all the way to the first three supplements that were released including Greyhawk, Blackmore, and Eldritch Wizardry.</p>



<p>On top of the resources themselves the book will also show off documents about how the game is played that Gary wrote, articles from Dragon, and even letters from Gary to show off not just what was happening directly to the game of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> but also to highlight what was happening to those in that space.</p>

<p>Greg Tito, Senior Communications Manager at WOTC, also took a moment to highlight that each of these sections come with their own colored ribbon to help you keep your place as you move through the massive tome.</p>

<h2>Inception of the Idea</h2>

<p>Jon Peterson, having written multiple <em>D&amp;D</em> history books, shared to those present how their involvement came about. "Wizards reached out to me back in the spring of 2021 and asked if I had any ideas about any ideas for what they could&nbsp; do to honor the 50th anniversary and I said 'Yes I do'"</p>

<p>"Having worked on books like <em>Playing At The World, The Elusive Shift, Game Wizards</em>&nbsp;I thought wouldn't it be amazing to go back to all the originals. Unfortunately, some of the material that tells this story is hard to get these days."</p>

<p>Peterson explained that due to the limited printings of some of these fan zines they now cost incredible amounts at auction and with this book they want to put that information in front of people and in an easier to access manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If it were up to me this book would be twice as long"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"We did our best to be able to include what we could that we thought was the most essential to telling the story."</p>

<h2>Precursors &amp; Inspirations</h2>

<p>Continuing to discuss the contents of the book specific highlights were paid to games like <em>Braunstein</em>, a wargame about an Austrian town being invaded where player characters were given individual goals and a referee would have to make up outcomes or consequences for players unique actions and how that ended up becoming the <em>Blackmoor </em>setting.</p>



<p>Included beside this explanation is a copy of the announcement of the release of "<em>Medieval Braunstein</em>" and an invitation to players to play. The invitation also included that there would be "refreshments" showing that even 54 years ago the DM would end up having to step up and provide table snacks.</p>

<p>Comparing what was going on in <em>Braunstein </em>to <em>Chainmail</em>, which Gygax was working on, was that <em>Braunstein </em>would have players take on the roles of characters in a more 1:1 fashion, and not just as a human at a table commanding groups of characters. <em>Chainmail </em>also had its own <em>Fantasy Supplement</em> to add in spells and wizards of varying ability.</p>

<h2>A Combination of Ideas</h2>

<p>Discussing further the inspirations and pieces that would work together to become <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> some other key points that were highlighted include the discussions between Arneson and his adventure in <em>Blackmoor</em>, Gygax working on <em>Chainmail</em>, and then the additional inclusion of <em>Outdoor Survival</em>, and <em>Dungeon</em>.</p>

<p>Each of these games were being individually worked on or developed with the awareness and investigation from one another that it made sense they would all end up coming together.</p>

<p>Looking through the different documents that are included it was highlighted that like an archeological dig where you can see one persons typing up of rules, with additional penwork and handwriting over it as editions shifted and addendums were made. One addendum that was pointed out was the handwritten inclusion of Sleep as a second-level Cleric spell.</p>

<h2>Documents Of Their Time</h2>

<p>One aspect of preserving these original documents that was pointed out was that there's verbiage in these that include things that we wouldn't say today. Wizards of the Coast hired inclusivity consultants to identify the language that they would want to call out.</p>

<p>For historical purposes they didn't want to alter any of that material, but they did want to educate readers and call out the historical context. From there the reader is able to be informed.</p>

Yesterday, District Judge Michael Fitzgerald ordered several defendants, including EngineOwning itself, to pay the company $14.465,600 for their creation and distribution of <em>Call of Duty </em>cheats.</p><p>In addition, the judge ordered EngineOwning to turn over its website, stop making and selling cheats, and pay $292,912 in attorney fees to Activision. You can find a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24698335-la22cv00051-mwf-o12?responsive=1&amp;title=1">PDF of the ruling here</a>. The site, engineowning.to, is apparently still operating today, offering cheats like an “Aimbot” that automatically aims and fires or the ability to see other players through walls for many games, including several in the <em>CoD </em>series.</p><p>Activision had previously won $3 million in a pair of settlements with two of the people — Ignacio Gayduchenko and Manuel Santiago — involved with EngineOwning, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name">as <em>IGN</em> notes</a>. But it had originally sued many more people who never responded to the lawsuit. </p><p>Yesterday’s filing named EngineOwning itself and its founders, Valentin Rick and Leon Risch, in addition to several others, including people involved in managing and marketing, site moderation, and an authorized EngineOwning reseller named Pascal Classen. Because they didn’t respond, the company finally asked the court in April to make a call, leading to yesterday’s default judgment. </p><p>The judge found EngineOwning and its many associated defendants guilty of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He also found them guilty of “intentionally” inducing players to buy and use cheats, despite knowing that the <em>Call of Duty</em> terms of use forbid it.</p><p>Gaming companies are increasingly turning to the courts to deal with cheat creators. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172558/destiny-2-bungie-cheat-settlement">Bungie settled</a> with <em>Destiny 2 </em>cheat makers for $13.5 million. Bungie also won a much smaller sum of $63,000, but it was also likely the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/25/24164679/bungie-anti-cheating-lawsuit-jury-trial-aimjunkies-copyright-violation-victory">first time a jury had ruled in such a case</a>. AimJunkies, the defendant in that case, had taken the extraordinary approach of fighting the case, rather than ignoring it or settling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="RLK2wV">Once you start talking about Jane Schoenbrun’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24064917/best-movies-2024"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em></a>, it’s hard to stop. Their eerie, tragic follow-up to the underground hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em></a> is endlessly layered and unpackable, from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">complicated central metaphor about trans coming-out</a> to its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer">close links to <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and other media</a> to that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation">indelible, hard-hitting ending</a>. </p>
<p id="mER3Uu">While there’s plenty to talk about throughout the movie, we keep coming back to the ending, in part because we’ve seen an interesting split in how people are interpreting it. Like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/22275255/bliss-movie-ending-mike-cahill-interview">the ending of <em>Inception</em></a>, like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-electrifying-ending-of-challengers-explained#:~:text=Kuritzkes%20wanted%20this%20climactic%20moment,final%20moment%20in%20the%20movie.">the ending of <em>Challengers</em></a>, the end of <em>TV Glow</em> prompts viewers to see different things in the same images and the same moments. Here at Polygon, we’re seeing the same split in our own writers… and you know what that means. It’s time for another case file at Polygon Court.</p>
<p id="RqmCl6">Polygon Court is where we take our divisive pop culture conflicts, as we did when we debated the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23613387/titanic-alternate-ending-meaning">alternate ending of James Cameron’s <em>Titanic</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23720275/fast-furious-movies-best-races-chases">most important part of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23521274/avatar-way-water-spider-jack-champion">the problem of Spider in <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></a>, the song cut from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23518742/muppet-christmas-carol-streaming-deleted-song-when-love-is-gone"><em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em></a>, and the mysterious, maybe problematic ending of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24080734/all-of-us-strangers-ending-explained-good-or-bad"><em>All of Us Strangers</em></a>.

<p id="fOzKlQ">The quick summary: <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> follows decades in the life of Owen (Ian Foreman as a young teenager, Justice Smith thereafter), a shy, deeply awkward, lonely young man who finds solace in a late-night cult TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>. He’s lured into the show’s fandom by a slightly older teenager, Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), who considers the show “more real than real life.” Maddy desperately wants to escape their small town, and sees <em>The Pink Opaque</em> as a form of escape. The show centers on two girls, Isabel and Tara, who share a psychic connection, which they use to fight the sinister Mr. Melancholy and his evil agents.</p>
<p id="b7yEoF">Eventually, Maddy runs away from home — she invites Owen to join her, but he’s too afraid to leave. Eight years later, Maddy returns, telling Owen that <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is real, she is actually Tara, he is actually Isabel, and that in the real world, Isabel has been captured by Mr. Melancholy, who buried her alive, using his potions to hold her in an illusion and prevent her from escaping. Owen’s entire life is that illusion. Maddy says she can break Owen out of it before Isabel dies, but he needs to undergo the same dangerous, frightening ritual she put herself through, allowing herself to be buried alive so she could get back in touch with herself as Tara and force her way through the illusion.</p>
<p id="Ty8Nnf">Owen refuses, and Maddy retreats, telling him he still has time, but not infinite time. Decades go by in the blink of an eye. <em>The Pink Opaque</em> changes in an unsettling, disappointing way. Owen claims he’s happy enough, but he seems disconnected, drifting, and miserable — until one day, at his job at an arcade, he snaps and screams that he’s dying, that he needs help. Everything around him freezes, and no one seems to notice what he’s said. He retreats to the bathroom, where he cuts open his chest and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation">sees the static glow of his television inside himself</a> — but he just returns to the arcade, where he apologizes to every customer he sees for his outburst, even though none of them acknowledge him or seem to notice. And that’s where the movie ends.</p>

<p id="w6ywjb"><strong>Tasha: </strong>Pete, I was shocked to hear you see a light at the end of the tunnel after all that! I <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation">wrote about the end of the movie</a> specifically because I felt the finale was so bleak, dark, and sad that I felt it was designed as a severe warning to anyone facing a difficult life or an uncomfortable decision. It left me unsettled and shaken. I admire Schoenbrun for the courage of their convictions, and for creating something so emotionally moving, and the more I think about the movie as a whole, the more I admire it. But certainly not for its sense of hope! You see it differently?  </p>
<p id="K1PPLq"><strong>Pete: </strong>I do! Like you, I have so much respect for this film. I loved the movie when I first saw it, and I’ve only grown to love and appreciate it more with every passing day. It’s rare to have a movie like this, where even people who have completely opposite readings of it than I do only make me appreciate the depth and complexity of what Schoenbrun has done here more. <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is a true, rare masterpiece, and a movie that fills me with a sense of fulfillment just thinking about it.</p>

<p id="pTpieC"><strong>Pete, the case for hope: </strong>Yes, I do see a glimmer of hope at the ending, but I understand why some audiences do not. As with the rest of the movie, I think Schoenbrun deftly leaves some things open for interpretation, while clearly signaling others. The movie is ripe for all sorts of allegorical interpretations, on top of the very present trans story on the surface. </p>
<p id="9b0UIC">For me, the ending suggests a breakthrough for Owen — but the kind of breakthrough that isn’t easy. Truly discovering yourself is a hard process, and one that comes with ups and downs, even through the beauty of finding a real truth. It can be an embarrassing experience to reinvent yourself — hence Owen’s constant apologies to anyone nearby — and I think the film beautifully showcases the complex, seemingly oxymoronic emotions that come with self-discovery. </p>
<p id="0h51fP"><strong>Tasha, the case against: </strong>I sure understand why people would want to see the end as a breakthrough for Owen, a step forward that’s going to lead him somewhere safer and happier. I recently recorded a podcast about the movie with <a href="https://episodes.ghost.io/">trans critic/author/screenwriter Emily St. James</a>, and she mentioned that over on AO3, people are already starting to write fanfic about Owen and Maddy’s future — a natural response to being left in such a dark place. </p>
<p id="SF0HE5">I just don’t see it on screen at all. The fact that he literally opens himself up to discover what’s inside him is a potent visual symbol — especially given his revelation earlier in the film that he feels like he’s empty, like someone hollowed him out. When Maddy tells him Mr. Melancholy literally cut out Isabel’s heart and put it in a refrigerator, that explains both his feeling of hollowness and what he sees when he cuts his chest open. (That act could also be debated as a metaphor for gender-confirming surgery.)</p>
<p id="xdqpCY">And then there’s the fact that seeing the TV glow inside himself is the first really overt supernatural thing he’s experienced, the first thing that might confirm Maddy’s story as something other than a delusion. (Depending on how he personally experienced that aborted moment where he stuffs his head into his own television and his creepy Fred Durst father drags him out.) </p>

<p id="4CoqfD">So the fact that he responds to all of that weighty coming-together of story and vision and explanation by closing himself up, going back to his job, and apologizing to everyone he sees is stunning to me. I don’t see it as suggesting he’s had a life-changing revelation, I see it as him suppressing his new knowledge, denying it, and trying to go back to normalcy. Did you see anything overt on the screen that keys you into a different future for him? Or is it more about a vibe and a hope? </p>
<p id="1VKNzh"><strong>Pete, the case for hope: </strong>To me, the fact that Owen is finally willing to look inside himself at all, in a way that is depicted so graphically and intimately, is a win on its own. That moment gives me hope for his future — that first, terrifying step is the most important one on the path to self-discovery. In some forms of self-discovery, it’s harder before it gets better.</p>
<p id="Kf1ZWN">And I think we know enough about the town and environment Owen is in to know that is true of this situation. It wouldn’t feel genuine to me for Owen to come out in celebration after this moment of self-discovery, and just have all the answers — it’s the spark that starts what’s going to be a difficult but fulfilling process.</p>
<p id="hiEyLS">As the sidewalk chalk puts it, when Schoenbrun’s camera pans over a piece of street graffiti after Maddy leaves: “There is still time.” There is still tragedy in the moment — as critic Willow Catelyn Maclay <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/film-review-i-tv-104674692">puts it in an excellent review of the film</a>, “there is still time, but only so much.” But I do believe that it is the first, important step on Owen’s path to being happy. There is still time for Owen, and for everyone. It isn’t too late to find yourself, no matter how far along in your journey you wait to truly look. </p>
<p id="O88lnH">Of course, I choose to believe that, but I think Schoenbrun’s comments about this support my reading of the ending. In an interview with Maclay, <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-jane-schoenbrun-on-i-saw-the-tv-glow/">they said</a>, “I don’t necessarily think that in a portrait of transness we need to see the person that they were before the egg cracked, or the person that they were after the egg cracked, or the person that they want to be. I don’t think we need an entire lifetime’s worth of growth to understand somebody.”</p>
<p id="BSkC5q">Schoenbrun has described this moment at the end of the film for Owen as the moment of the egg cracking, and I think they want to leave what’s next intentionally open, because this film is precisely about that moment of self-discovery — not necessarily about what happens next. I can understand why that might feel unfulfilling to some people, or why it could be interpreted to mean Owen will remain in the closet. But I choose to see it as the start of Owen’s next chapter. </p>
<p id="rOOsG1"><strong>Tasha, the case against: </strong>That’s a compelling argument! I know Schoenbrun is drawing from their own journey of self-discovery here, so we can potentially look to where they ended up to suggest where Owen might end up. It’s good to know they don’t think of this as the absolute end for Owen, in spite of the long delay and the threat to Isabel.</p>
<p id="V8mzSU">I still don’t see anything in this movie that gives me hope for him personally, though, given how consistent he is about resisting. But… I want to! Maybe this is just a “glass half empty/glass half full” <a href="https://www.avclub.com/so-the-lady-or-the-tiger-28-stories-that-make-the-aud-1798230464">lady-or-the-tiger story situation</a>, where what you see in the ending says more about you and your bent toward cynicism or optimism than it says about what Schoenbrun actually puts on the screen. Maybe I just need to fight my own cynicism here. </p>
<p id="JtseWv">Looking at another quote from Schoenbrun, though, <a href="https://ew.com/i-saw-the-tv-glow-director-jane-schoenbrun-explains-ending-justice-smith-brigette-lundy-paine-8643442">talking to Entertainment Weekly about the ending</a>, I think it’s also clear that they wanted to leave the movie open to that cynical read, because of a sense that an optimistic read would feel unrealistic, and wouldn’t affect audiences the same way: </p>
<blockquote><p id="7bMVN1">I think it takes years, if not a lifetime, to undo that damage [of being constantly pushed to suppress a trans identity]. And to undo it in our case in 2024, in a world where, at best, cis people want to be PC and nice and use the right pronouns but don’t see me the way that I want them to, and, at worst, want me dead — it’s kind of psychotic, and for the movie to end in any way beyond this, like, fledgling, furtive, maybe a first step that’s still rife with trauma and all of the consequences of it, would have felt to me like I wasn’t doing my job as an artist.</p></blockquote>
<p id="NFJjGs">Speaking of what Schoenbrun achieves as an artist here, Emily wrote about the ending for Vulture, and I had the chance to preview that piece. It hasn’t been published yet (I’ll link it here when it goes up), but she has some insights I think are particularly enlightening about how the movie ends in such an ambiguous, unresolved way because that “gnawing sense of dissatisfaction,” the sense of melancholy and disconnection, is meant to leave cis people with “contact-high gender dysphoria.” I don’t know if that was part of Schoenbrun’s thinking at all, but the idea that the movie has to end in an ambiguous way to provoke a sense of recognition and understanding strikes me as powerful and daring.</p>

<p id="yHcYdt"><strong>Pete, the case for hope: </strong>I deeply appreciate how ambiguous <em>TV Glow</em> is, how open it is for all sorts of interpretations, and that Schoenbrun does not give in to easy answers. That’s one of the things I find most fascinating in this movie, that our colleague Austen Goslin put very well when I was discussing the movie with him: Many examples of cinema in the trans canon are movies that are not textually trans, but can be read subtextually as trans. This is a movie that is textually trans, but can be read subtextually in all sorts of other different directions.</p>
<p id="pekbYO">It makes the movie much more discussable, for sure, but it’s also a breath of fresh air in an environment that seems to require an unreasonable amount of clarity from challenging art.  Even the quotes you dropped in above — I read them in support of my take on the ending, you read them in support of yours. Cinema! Gotta love it.</p>
<p id="0s5v7r">My interpretation of the ending comes down to this: Not all forms of self-discovery and change are created equal. Sometimes, it becomes harder before it gets better.</p>
<p id="1D55qy">Such a massive moment of self-discovery shakes people to their very core. Yes, you may find some semblance of truth hiding within yourself, but that’s also a revelation that you’ve been living your life as a lie — lying to yourself, and to everyone else around you. In this light, Owen’s actions after that moment of discovery make complete sense to me. Owen’s life isn’t over just because the movie is over, and the end gives the opportunity for a choice. A choice where Owen no longer lives as a shell of a person, no matter how hard it remains to get there.</p>
<p id="aLA59r">As Schoenbrun said <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jane-schoenbrun/id1330522019?i=1000655384730">on an excellent episode of Tuck Woodstuck’s <em>Gender Reveal</em> podcast</a>: “What comes first are the negative consequences, not the positive ones.”</p>
<p id="2u6lKu"><strong>Tasha, the case against: </strong>Amazing. Well, amid all the other things this movie is about, it’s about working on yourself, and finding a path to a more satisfactory, centered life. I’m going to take that note, and go work on my cynicism problem. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/populating-the-city-builder-of-the-future-a-deep-dive-into-character-diversity-in-cities-skylines-ii<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Images via Paradox Interactive. </span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello, I’m Raphael Benros, a product marketer at Didimo, working alongside our engineering team to share with you how we partnered with Colossal Order to automate and accelerate the production pipeline for creating the scores of unique citizens featured within the world of Cities: Skylines II using our AI-powered, 3D character creation technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was released by Colossal Order in 2015. For the city-builder genre, the game introduced a comprehensive framework for urban planning, allowing players to tackle complex issues like zoning, road placement, taxation, public services, and overall city management, including budget, health, employment, traffic, and pollution. These elements were combined with a sandbox mode to provide complete creative freedom for players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Built on the experience gained from their earlier </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities in Motion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series, which focused on transportation systems, Colossal Order developed a game engine that could simulate the daily routines of nearly a million unique citizens. This capacity not only deepened the gameplay experience but also helped players intuitively address urban challenges such as traffic congestion. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stood out for its depth and open-ended gameplay, sharply contrasting with the 2013 SimCity's restrictive elements like always-online gameplay and limited city sizes. The ability to modify the game via the Steam Workshop extended its longevity and fostered a dedicated player community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cities: Skylines, while a commercial triumph, initially faced opportunities for enhancement. Early iterations of the game drew feedback for their absence of dynamic elements like natural disasters and random events. Colossal Order positively responded to this input, enriching the game with expansions that incorporated these vibrant features. Furthermore, the game's intricate mechanics, initially challenging for new players, were progressively refined through updates designed to boost accessibility and enrich the user experience, demonstrating the developer's commitment to continual improvement and player satisfaction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One element Colossal Order sought to improve was the repetitive nature of the non-player characters (NPCs); the original game featured only about 50 different NPC models.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Elevating ">Elevating <span>Cities: Skylines II</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Colossal Order aimed to surpass their previous. The development team was set on creating a city teeming with unique individuals, reflecting the dynamic variety of real urban populations. This ambition was rooted in the game's new capabilities and enhancements, particularly in character modeling and animation, which were facilitated by advanced technologies like Popul8 from Didimo.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Design Goals and New Directions">Design Goals and New Directions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was clear: enhance every aspect of the game. With improvements like the new Photo Mode, which allows players to zoom in closely on urban scenes, NPCs needed to withstand scrutiny up close—demanding a higher level of detail and realism. This led to a push for significantly more variation among the characters to foster a more inclusive and realistic gaming world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To enhance the realism and diversity of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Colossal Order meticulously crafted an extensive wardrobe to dress the game's myriad characters, ensuring that each NPC could represent a wide range of professions and lifestyles—from firefighters and police officers to office workers and motorcyclists. This attention to detail extended to seasonal clothing variations, providing warmth in winter and comfort during summer months. However, the true value of these garments would only be realized through the diverse characters designed to wear them. It was imperative that these clothes not only varied aesthetically but also functioned on characters of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds, making the city's population as vibrant and diverse as its urban landscape.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Character Creation with Popul8">Character Creation with Popul8</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Popul8 played a pivotal role in achieving the desired diversity in NPCs. The tool enabled Colossal Order’s developers to quickly generate a wide array of character models that could seamlessly integrate into the game’s environment. With Popul8, Colossal Order could easily&nbsp; create varied groups of citizens—each tailored for different seasons, age brackets, and occupations, reflecting a broad spectrum of humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, Popul8's asset-fitting capabilities played a crucial role in Colossal Order's ability to rapidly produce a diverse cast of characters. The tool's mathematical approach allowed for precise garment fitting to new body shapes with about 95% accuracy, greatly accelerating the character creation process. This efficiency enabled the developers to focus more on the creative aspects of character grouping, significantly enhancing productivity and diversity in character design. With the bulk of the manual labor taken care of, the Colossal Order team were free to create more variety in characters, check and test important details or continue working on optimizing gameplay ahead of the highly anticipated release.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Technical and Artistic Process">The Technical and Artistic Process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The creation of NPCs was both a technical and artistic endeavor. Colossal Order was able to use a detailed base mesh that represented their unique art style straight from Popul8. This was then used to generate diverse characters. The tool provided sliders for different physical characteristics and ethnicities, ensuring a wide representation of people. The process also included designing seasonal clothing options in Popul8, allowing characters to change outfits according to the weather, adding another layer of realism.</span></p><p>Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Behind the Scenes: From Concept to Game Integration">Behind the Scenes: From Concept to Game Integration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The integration of these characters into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brought the virtual city to life. Early placeholder characters were replaced with detailed models that interacted with the environment—jogging in parks, taking selfies, and attending street events. This transformation was crucial in making the city feel alive and diverse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical integration also involved ensuring that animations were adaptable to various character forms without glitches. This was particularly challenging for models that deviated significantly from the average build or height, such as children or characters with more unique body types.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most significant technical challenges faced by Colossal Order was the task of rendering a large number of characters within a single scene without overwhelming the player's GPU. Traditionally, rendering a single character consumes up to 50MB of memory, which quickly becomes impractical when scaling up to thousands of characters. To overcome this, the team implemented a memory-optimized format that drastically reduced the memory footprint of each character. This approach enabled the use of batch rendering techniques, where multiple characters are processed in a single draw call. By adopting this method, the game was able to efficiently render scenes with up to 10,000 characters, creating a bustling, lively urban environment without compromising performance or visual fidelity.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reflecting Real-World Diversity">Reflecting Real-World Diversity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the key successes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is its reflection of real-world diversity. Characters in the game exhibit a range of ages, body types, and ethnic backgrounds, contributing to a city that feels vibrant and authentic. Each NPC's clothing and behavior respond dynamically to the game’s environmental conditions, further enhancing the realism.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Future Directions and Community Engagement">Future Directions and Community Engagement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving forward, Colossal Order plans to continue expanding the diversity and realism of the character models. This includes introducing more varied animations, accessories, and options for characters with disabilities to broaden the game’s inclusivity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development team is also working with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> player community, inviting feedback and suggestions on what types of characters they want to see in the game. This collaborative approach’s purpose is to both help enhance the game's development while also ensuring that it remains a living project, continually evolving to meet the desires and expectations of players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The journey from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showcases a significant evolution in how NPCs are created and integrated into a massive, dynamic world. By leveraging advanced tools like Popul8 and embracing a philosophy of diversity and realism, Colossal Order has created a model for how city-building games can be a world that more realistically mirrors the complexity and diversity of our own.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/post-mortem-soul-covenant-development-insights-and-lessons-learned-from-1-hit-on-playstation-vr2-in-asia-markets<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On April 18th, our Japan Studio launched our VR JRPG, SOUL COVENANT, to global audiences on Meta Quest, PlayStation VR2, and PCVR platforms. As a co-founder of Thirdverse, overseeing our studios in both Japan and the US, and a games industry veteran with over a decade of experience in the VR market, I have witnessed firsthand the evolution and steady adoption of VR technologies. Our Japan Studio’s latest VR game aimed not only to captivate but also to broaden the market by engaging more casual gamers in VR. Here, we share the development insights and lessons learned from the journey of SOUL COVENANT, highlighting both successes and challenges.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Celebrating the Wins: Enthusiastic Reception of SOUL COVENANT on PlayStation VR2 in Asia Markets">Celebrating the Wins: Enthusiastic Reception of SOUL COVENANT on PlayStation VR2 in Asia Markets</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the initial launch, SOUL COVENANT major success in some key markets – reaching #1 in sales on PlayStation VR2 in Japan, where it has strongly resonated with audiences, notably in Japan and other parts of Asia. This enthusiastic reception underscores the alignment of our game with the preferences of these VR players who appreciate immersive narrative experiences. The development team's deep love for JRPG mechanics and storytelling shines through in every element of the game, making it a hit among traditional and casual VR players alike.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Development Insights">Development Insights</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to our successes, we’ve also experienced some major opportunities to adopt and learn for our future projects. Let’s dive in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technical Challenges and Solutions</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the major challenges we faced during the development of SOUL COVENANT was managing the performance demands of VR, particularly given the high number of creatures and enemies in the game. VR hardware, especially on standalone headsets like Meta Quest, has limitations that required us to optimize the game's performance continuously. We focused on maintaining a high graphical quality while ensuring the game ran smoothly, which was particularly challenging with the fast-paced, action-heavy gameplay (inspired by titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dynasty Warriors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another technical hurdle was minimizing motion sickness, a common issue for Japan players in VR. To address this, we designed intuitive controls and simplified mechanics, ensuring that players could enjoy extended play sessions without discomfort. This approach, while beneficial for reducing motion sickness, also meant we had to forgo some complex physics-based interactions that might have appealed to more VR enthusiasts in other markets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Design Challenges and User Feedback</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cultural differences played a significant role in the reception of SOUL COVENANT. While the game was well-received in Asia, and particularly in Japan, hitting #1 in sales on PlayStation VR2, we noticed varying levels of enthusiasm in other regions. Japanese players, who often play VR games while seated, appreciated the game's design. However, Western players, who tend to prefer standing and more physically engaging VR experiences, found the gameplay less immersive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We realized that our development team, being based in Japan, had naturally designed the game with Japanese players in mind. This led to some design choices that did not resonate as well with Western audiences. For instance, we avoided aggressive physics interactions and focused more on narrative and storytelling elements, which aligned with the preferences of Japanese gamers but not necessarily those of Western players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Lessons Learned">Key Lessons Learned</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding Your Audience</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most critical lessons we learned is the importance of understanding and designing for your target audience - whether it’s local or global, core or casual, and so on. While it is natural to cater to familiar cultural preferences, expanding our focus to include a broader range of player experiences was essential for us. In future projects, we plan to conduct more extensive market research and beta testing across different regions to better tailor our games to diverse player bases when the focus is reaching and engaging more global audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Flexibility in Game Design</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also learned the value of flexibility in game design. Implementing different modes, such as a more physically demanding "hard mode" and a less intense "beginner mode," could cater to both hardcore and casual gamers across markets where preferences really vary. This approach would allow us to maintain the core elements that make our game unique while adapting to various player gameplay nuances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technological Innovation</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investing in proprietary technology and optimizing existing tools were crucial to overcoming technical challenges. Our experience with SOUL COVENANT has reinforced the importance of staying at the forefront of VR technology, continuously seeking innovative solutions to enhance performance and player experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Looking Ahead">Looking Ahead</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development and launch of SOUL COVENANT have been both challenging and rewarding. Our success on PlayStation VR2 in Japan and Asian demonstrates the potential of VR to offer novel and engaging gaming experiences. However, the varying reception across different regions highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of global audiences for VR.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we move forward, we are committed to learning from these experiences and applying these lessons to future projects. By embracing a broader range of player preferences and continuing to innovate in VR technology, we believe that VR gaming can transcend traditional boundaries and invite players from all walks of life into immersive, compelling worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With our continued dedication to innovation and quality, Thirdverse is poised to keep pushing the limits of what VR can achieve. We invite gamers to join us on this exciting journey as we strive to develop experiences that not only entertain but also inspire and connect with people across the globe.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-neil-druckmann-interview-shows-why-we-need-journalists.883977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In last Friday’s Aftermath newsletter, I wrote about an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240528084149/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> <em>Last of Us</em> creator Neil Druckmann gave to a Sony blog. He said a lot of dumb shit about AI and mainstream perceptions of video games that people across the internet swiftly dunked on. Except it turns out he didn’t exactly say those things, prompting Sony to now remove the interview.</p><p>That Friday night, Druckmann took to <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to clarify his closing remarks in the interview, in which he was quoted as saying that his upcoming game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming” and saying that HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> show has “spotlighted gaming” and is helping “bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers.” On Twitter, Druckmann wrote, “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with SONY, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost.” He then includes a very long, very different answer than what ended up in the final interview, which most notably doesn’t include the “redefine mainstream perceptions” line.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with SONY, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here's the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game... <a href="https://t.co/tVuxX3LYJF">pic.twitter.com/tVuxX3LYJF</a></p>— Neil Druckmann (@Neil_Druckmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Game File’s <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794205221448765443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo</a> posted a good highlight of the stark and copious differences, in which he pointed out that the final interview doesn’t include a line Druckmann actually said, which is “Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows, but I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren’t aware of the kinds of experiences that exist in games.”</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you're curious (about what he said; and how I spend a Friday night when my wife and kids are away), here's a comparison of the original answer and the edited one. </p><p>Many changes</p><p>No surprise, this was cut: "Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows" <a href="https://t.co/FkxNkqQPY2">pic.twitter.com/FkxNkqQPY2</a></p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1794205221448765443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Some time <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1795802233952510235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today</a>, based on results from the Wayback Machine, Sony removed the interview, replacing it with text explaining,</p><blockquote><p>In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This raises a couple questions. One is that, while Druckmann clarified his final statement in the interview, he didn’t say anything about other parts of it, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the unpopular stuff he said about AI</a>, which Sony now seems to be disavowing as well. It’s naive to think that the final question was the only thing misrepresented on the page, but it raises suspicion about the accuracy of the entire interview. What, exactly, did Druckmann even say?</p><p>The second question is, how did this happen? That question is easier to answer: this isn’t an interview with a journalist. It <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sony-unveils-vision-for-growth-and-creative-synergy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears </a>to be part of a corporate strategy push that includes <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other interviews</a>, and not meant for a broader audience. It feels like whoever put this together–there’s no name attached to the “question” part of the Q&amp;A–had the instinct to edit things into investor-friendly language. In that light, cutting the line “Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows” makes a certain cursed sense; in this age of IP, Sony probably very much wants games to be movies and TV shows! But even with that context, it’s still misrepresenting what Druckmann said, using his words to launder a corporation’s desired message.</p><p>A journalist writing for an independent publication wouldn’t do this. While a journalist will often summarize a quote in a piece that includes their own words alongside a source’s, that’s not done in question and answer formats like Druckmann’s Sony interview, in which a reader would reasonably assume the subject’s answers to questions are their actual answers. In Q&amp;As, a journalist will sometimes edit a quote a bit for clarity or space, but that’s always indicated with ellipses, brackets, or other punctuation. To use a few words to reinvent a quote would get a journalist in a lot of trouble, if not outright fired. (It’s unclear what’s happened to whoever conducted this interview, but given the backlash, I can’t imagine it’s something good.)</p><p>But again, this isn’t journalism; this is corporate messaging dressed up to look a little bit like journalism. And while a badly-written interview would have just been an internal crisis for people who work at Sony if it hadn’t broken orbit to a mainstream audience, we’ve been seeing this kind of thing get mistaken for games journalism for years now. We’ve all sat through press conferences that look like interviews when they’re in fact PR exercises, where interviewers ask questions they obviously know the answers to because everyone on stage works together. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> run their own blogs, as well as major publishers and storefronts like <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic</a>, where alongside the game updates and sale announcements that are clearly their purview you’ll also find <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7GuRzEQEr7vbP8K6Y6RLl2/rainbow-six-siege-operation-new-blood-operator-remaster-and-balancing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guides</a>, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/22/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-our-full-four-part-feature-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/seven-features-that-make-men-of-war-2-the-most-detailed-strategy-game-you-ll-play-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quasi-reviews</a> that you might expect to see on a mainstream games site.&nbsp;</p><p>None of these things are journalism, and personally I don’t think they’re intentionally attempting to mislead an audience into thinking they are. If anything, a reader might mistake them for journalism because actual games sites are coming to resemble PR more and more each day, as games journalism’s complicated relationship with access combines with ownership’s obsession with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traffic</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEO</a> until practically everything looks like marketing. This erosion of actual journalism exists alongside publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blacklists</a>, late or <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-suicide-squad-situation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withheld</a> review codes, prioritizing streamers and influencers over journalists, <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sketchy funding</a> for games sites, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ken-levine-judas-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softball interviews</a>, among other ills. Combined with rampant distrust of and contempt for the media, and the unique manifestation of that in games, the Druckmann interview feels a lot more dire than just a major fuckup on a corporate blog.&nbsp;</p><p>As journalism outlets close left and right, and as more journalists <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switch careers into PR</a> and leave those newcomers who can even find jobs without mentors and training, we’re likely to have more and more information filtered through corporate mouthpieces with their own standards and priorities, and who don't do what they do out of a desire to tell the public true things. Journalism might have weird, confusing rules and customs and its own <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/a-test-of-the-news-wesley-lowery-objectivity.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdated, problematic</a> values, but the truth remains its highest priority; you have to accurately report what a person did or said, because you believe it's important that the public knows those things. Without an <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent press</a>, stuff like this interview might be all we'll have left.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase.
</p>
<p>
After being rumoured and speculated about for some time, the Playstation maker has finally confirmed that yes, we will be getting a showcase event in May.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off tomorrow, 30th May, at 11pm UK time. That's 3pm PT / 6pm ET for those across the pond.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Let's Play God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla - Roguelike rampage!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AliuDYge_s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The show is set to last for "30+" minutes, and will cover PS5 and PS VR2 titles. It will also provide us with a look at some upcoming PlayStation Studios games, which are arriving later this year. In total, 14 titles will be shown.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, we will hear more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-the-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc-leaker-suggests">God of War: Ragnarök's reported PC release</a> here? Or, more on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which was first announced at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-showcase">PlayStation showcase around this time last year</a>.
</p>
<p>I suppose, we will have to wait and see. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<figure>

<p>
If you fancy making an evening/early morning combo of video game broadcasts, remember Konami also has its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-announcement-stream-scheduled-for-this-week">Silent Hill Transmission show set for tomorrow</a> as well. This particular show will air after State of Play, at midnight (again, that is UK timing). </p>
<p>
Both essentially act as a kick off into this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">not-E3/Summer Games Fest/IGN Live week</a>, with showcases from Ubisoft and Xbox to follow.</p>

            <p>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">reviewed</a> shark ‘em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/maneater">Maneater</a>, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trash-of-the-titans">Trash Of The Titans</a> does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it's just plain fun.</p>

<p>Solo-willed-into-existence by developer Alex 'Thayer And Back Again', Trash Of The Titans’ grid-based, elevation-respecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> most immediately evokes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. You play as a party of assorted trash mammals trying to protect your rotting hauls from a gang of criminal vermin known as The Rat Crue. Misspelling ‘crew’ is, of course, the telltale signature of only the most badbutt crews. It’s vaguely roguelike in structure, with one stage leading to the next as you nab upgrades based on how much trash you managed to protect. The game’s setting is left vague, although it is clearly set somewhere with a bizarre culture of nibbling at whole chickens before discarding them, since that's most of the trash.</p>

<p>Turn order is set before each round, and each trash mammal has their own specialisation. Badger is a tank, able to clear gaps by charging, with a bonus buff to attack damage based on how much health they’re missing. Racoon is a sneak thief, able to turn invisible and backstab. They can actually cloak, stab, then re-cloak in a single round, although this eats through MP, which regens slowly throughout. Happily, they also provide some bonus regen for squad cohesion. Possum is an archer, able to take advantage of the aforementioned elevation, and Skunk is a fart-shaman, with poison gas attacks used for board control.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s some lovely QOL features, like previews for specific attack damage. Also, move and attack points are spent separately, so you can mix and match for dastardly plays. There’s plenty of additional non-trash additions, like boons you can collect for extra abilities, and bonus buffs and upgrades at the end of each mission depending on how much trash you save. It’s neat! I said “this looks neat” when I saw it, and then I played it, and it’s neat! If only life in general could unfold so smoothly! Trash Of The Titans, you are forgiven for your rat slander. It’s out today, and there’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450400/Trash_of_the_Titans/">demo available</a> at time of writing.</p>

			<p>The former NPD Group (now named “Circana”) has released its <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1795803675530522972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full North American sales data for April</a>, and it was a bit of a down month for the industry. Players spent $4.1 billion on games, additional content, and hardware in April, down 3 percent year-on-year. While software spending was up slightly, hardware numbers were down a whopping 43 percent year-on-year. As has been the case for a several month straight, PS5 was #1 in terms of unit and dollar sales, Switch was #2 in terms of unit sales, and Xbox Series X/S was #2 in terms of dollar sales.</p>
<p>Sony had a lot to be happy about on the software front, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade</a> debuted at #1 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> held steady at #2 in its third month on the market. A number of previously-Xbox-exclusive games that launched on PlayStation in April also hopped up the charts – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sea-of-thieves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a> went from #55 in March to #4 in April and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grounded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grounded</a> went from #167 to #12. Meanwhile, the effect of the Fallout TV series was also felt, boosting Fallout 4 to #5 and Fallout 76 up to #8.</p>
<p>Here are April’s top 20 premium games according to Circana:</p>
<p><em>1 - Stellar Blade</em></p>
<p><em>2 - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p><em>3 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em></p>
<p><em>4 - Sea of Thieves</em></p>
<p><em>5 - Fallout 4</em></p>
<p><em>6 - MLB The Show 24</em></p>
<p><em>7 - Dragon's Dogma 2</em></p>
<p><em>8 - Fallout 76</em></p>
<p><em>9 - Hogwarts Legacy</em></p>
<p><em>10 - EA Sports FC 24</em></p>
<p><em>11 - Rise of the Ronin</em></p>
<p><em>12 - Grounded</em></p>
<p><em>13 - Minecraft</em></p>
<p><em>14 - Madden NFL 24</em></p>
<p><em>15 - Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></p>
<p><em>16 - Rainbow Six Siege</em></p>
<p><em>17 - Tekken 8</em></p>
<p><em>18 - Mario Kart 8</em></p>
<p><em>19 - Elden Ring</em></p>
<p><em>20 - Spider-Man 2</em></p>
<p>And here are the top games of 2024 to date:</p>
<p><em>1 - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p><em>2 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em></p>
<p><em>3 - Dragon's Dogma 2</em></p>
<p><em>4 - MLB The Show 24</em></p>
<p><em>5 - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></p>

		<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/644930/They_Are_Billions/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>They Are Billions</em></a><em> </em>is a steampunk zombie survival RTS, which is probably not the most enticing collection of words and might tell you a lot about the particular moment it emerged from. On the other hand, it’s a game made of everyone’s favorite RTS mission archetype: the hold-out mission. Carentan in <em>Company of Heroes</em>, the mountaintop defense at the culmination of <em>Warcraft III</em>, any number of missions in the Terran campaigns of <em>StarCraft</em>… the list of all-time classic missions goes on.&nbsp;<em>Homeworld 3 </em>recently made a couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F368tbT9QQ&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">worthy additions</a> to the list as well.</p><p>Structurally they tend to solve the biggest problem with RTS games, which is that they are so fast-paced and ask so much of the player that it’s rare they give you a chance to sit back and watch the fireworks. They were so popular you could argue they spawned the tower defense genre, which goes back to <em>StarCraft </em>and really took off with special game modes for <em>Warcraft III. They Are Billions </em>just winds the clock back to the <em>Age of Empires II </em>era with an RTS where the entire game is about surviving huge onslaughts of enemies that will gratifyingly march headlong into your defenses.</p><p>It’s also a game designed to be very dangerous to me personally. It’s conceptually straightforward, but lends itself, via its No Reloads survival mode, to repeated runs. I constantly work to beat the odds and get a high score, but I can pour hours into a run only to have it completely undone due to an obvious-in-retrospect error. As the zombies overrun my sprawling colony and the its little clockwork defenses crack and then crumble, I’m primed to move on to the next run immediately.</p><p>The problem is that I’m never sure I want to. This past winter, when I finally had a week to myself and was still reeling from grueling months of medical emergencies involving my dog Mina, I had a stack of great games I’d wanted to dig into before the end of the year. The trouble was, while I had a lot of good games to play, I felt like they were all too good to be wasted on the tatters of mental energy and slivers of free time that I had available. Restless scrolling through my Steam library brought <em>They Are Billions </em>back to my attention. Five minutes later, I was launching into my first game. “I’ll just mess around in there until I figure out what I really want to play,” I told myself.</p><p>For months, I found myself playing it whenever I had a few loose minutes. It went from feeling like a welcome return to an old favorite to something closer to a fixation. I'd quit the game and consider watching or playing something else, but the only thing I could think about is how much better I think I’d do on the next run.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo via </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/NumantianGames?snr=1_5_9__2000&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><span>Numantian Games</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t know if it was always like this for me. However, when I think back to my love affairs with <em>Europa Universalis III</em>, <em>Medieval: Total War</em>, or <em>Civilization II, </em>they had a lot of the same characteristics. I internalized these games so much that I could almost play them on mental autopilot, racing through rehearsed steps toward the trickier parts I was dying to master. </p><p>Now, all those franchises have gotten just complicated enough that I find they require more mental investment, which both saves me from this compulsive loop but also creates the kind of friction that makes it almost too easy for me to bounce off a game entirely. There are a lot of days I don’t want to think <em>quite</em> that<em> </em>hard, so I’ll save a strategy game or a tricky RPG “for later when I have more time and I’m in a better place.” (It looks like, far from being the only one, I am part of <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2024/05/21/strategy-decline/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">a measurable trend</a>.) Meanwhile, games like <em>They Are Billions </em>keep slipping under my guard. Hours that I didn’t think I had available to spend will go flying by, and I’ll find myself wondering, “What was the point of doing all that again and again?”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166978/tom-bombadil-rings-of-power-season-2-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wskIZk"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23414847/rings-power-season-1-review"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a> is doing what no Lord of the Rings adaptation has done before: putting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/20/22239302/who-is-tom-bombadil-poem-hobbit-lotr-books-movies">Tom Bombadil</a> in the thing. </p>
<p id="YoY6IL">Rory Kinnear (<em>Black Mirror</em>) will play the puissant and pacifistic character in season 2 of the Prime Video series, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/tom-bombadil-the-rings-of-power-first-look">Vanity Fair</a> revealed on Wednesday. With a few months ahead of its Aug. 29 premiere date, showrunners <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23329258/lord-rings-power-review-episode-release">J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay</a> were ready to explain how and why they brought the oft-overlooked Tolkien character to the screen. </p>
<p id="g3vcec">To fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a>, Tom Bombadil is divisive out of proportion to his prominence. The linchpin of a three-chapter digression early in the pages of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, Tom rescues Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin from an intelligent and malicious tree known as Old Man Willow and takes them back to his house to meet his wife. But also, he’s apparently so powerful that the One Ring has no effect on him. </p>

<p id="gCZBjF">Tom is neither hobbit nor human, nor dwarven, nor elven. He says that he’s older than the existence of rivers, and trees, and paths. Though he has Gandalf’s deep respect, he’s not a wizard, and aside from saving the hobbits’ lives a couple times, he has no interest in weighing in on the Ring Quest. But also he’s cheerful, has a big bushy beard, wears a funny hat, and he constantly spouts almost nonsensical rhyming couplets.</p>
<p id="Y7VxpS">It’s that mystery and dichotomy that made Payne and McKay interested in bringing him into <em>The Rings of Power</em>, despite his canonical appearances being limited to those few chapters in <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. </p>
<p id="Fxj54b">“Tom Bombadil is singing and saying lines that could be nursery rhymes from children’s poems,” Payne told Vanity Fair. “So he sort of defies the tonal shift of the rest of the season and is a real point of light amidst an otherwise sea of darkness.” </p>
<p id="soFybX">Payne and McKay’s Bombadil is concerned with the fate of natural life on Middle-earth: “In our story, he has gone out to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23365209/lord-rings-power-white-robe-character-sauron-dweller-nomad-ascetic">the lands of Rhûn</a>,” said Payne, “which we learn used to be sort of Edenic and green and beautiful, but now is sort of a dead wasteland.” This isn’t a big stretch for a figure who soothes angry trees and married the daughter of a river, but in <em>Rings of Power</em>, he’ll drop some cryptically-put advice to Stranger, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403120/rings-power-who-is-stranger-wizard-actor-daniel-weyman">may or may not be an amnesiac Gandalf</a>, instead of a group of hobbits.</p>
<p id="TOb3ST">“He nudges the Stranger along his journey, which he knows will eventually protect the larger natural world that he cares about. So I’d say our Tom Bombadil is slightly more interventionist than you see in the books, but only by 5% or 10%,” Payne said.</p>
<p id="Pfko8u">For decades, casual readers have puzzled over Tom’s place in the Lord of the Rings, but the truth is that the character is something of a relic of the origin of Tolkien’s high fantasy trilogy as a simple sequel to his episodic adventure for children, <em>The Hobbit</em>. Tolkien wrote Tom, a figure <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/20/22239302/who-is-tom-bombadil-poem-hobbit-lotr-books-movies">originally invented to entertain his children</a>, into the story before he had even conceived of Aragorn’s kingly destiny, or that Sauron was the ultimate antagonist, or that Frodo’s name shouldn’t be “Bingo Baggins.”</p>
<p id="a6KXaR">So why did Tom stay in, through all processes of revision? </p>

<p id="YVaWeh">“Tom Bombadil is not an important person — to the narrative,” Tolkien once wrote to his proofreader for <em>The Lord of the Rings.</em> “I suppose he has some importance as a ‘comment.’ I mean, I do not really write like that... He represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely.”</p>
<p id="ESuFGH">Tolkien was an academic specializing in Old English and Scandinavian languages, one who held a lifelong fascination for the folklore, mythology, legends, and epic poetry of those regions. His fiction is a constant mix and remix of stories he invented for his children, fairy tales, Norse myth, Arthuriana, epic poetry like <em>Beowulf</em>, and other references, allusions, and motifs familiar pretty much only to other academics in his field. </p>
<p id="A3VK4S">Tom Bombadil began as a cameo for his children, but he stayed in the story because he made it feel more like Tolkien’s favorite <em>kind</em> of stories. Tolkien just liked what Tom Bombadil contributed to the vibe — and so does <em>The Rings of Power</em>, apparently. </p>

<p>A new trademark has been filed by FireFly Studios named Stronghold: The Dark Ages, which could suggest it will be the next name for the series’ next installment.</p>



<p>The trademark was first spotted by <a href="https://respawnfirst.com/a-new-installment-in-the-stronghold-series-possibly-trademarked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Respawn First</a>, which was filed on April 8th, 2024, and is currently in the ‘”examination” stage. </p>



<p>If you thought ‘The Dark Ages’ sounded familiar, well, you’re right, as last week Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively reported that the next Doom game</a> would be called ‘Doom: The Dark Ages.’ Our reporting (and the impending reveal of the next Doom game) suggests that the title is likely to be rejected.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the filing does tell us that the next Stronghold game is almost certainly to be set in the ‘Dark Ages’, which began after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>



<p>The next Stronghold game would mark FireFly Studios’ first major new release following the studios’ acquisition by Devolver Digital in 2021. Currently, FireFly Studios is focused on post-launch content of Stronghold: Definitive Edition, which was released in November 2023 and has received ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam based on 6400 reviews at the time of writing.</p>



<p>What do you think of a new Stronghold title? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion played a massive role in my childhood. It was one of my first true open-world RPG experiences, and I lost myself for the longest time. I explored every inch of Cyrodiil, favoring Anvil. Despite my undying love for the RPG, I can admit that it’s showing its age. We could use more information about the Oblivion Remaster release date, so here’s what we know currently!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-oblivion-getting-a-remaster">Is Oblivion Getting a Remaster?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the FTC leaks, specifically the ZeniMax Management Forecast, we know that Bethesda was working on an Oblivion Remaster at one point. The open-world RPG project was said to launch sometime in Fiscal Year 22, meaning sometime between July 2021 and June 2022, but that didn’t happen. Most projects received significant delays following the pandemic and a tumultuous games industry.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Phil Spencer said you can’t always trust these leaks, as projects constantly shift and change in game development. He’s likely trying to cast a shadow of doubt over the entire leak, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening sometime this year or next!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-fallout-3-remaster-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do We Know the Fallout 3 Remaster Release Date?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-oblivion-remaster-release-date">When is the Oblivion Remaster Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t yet have an official Oblivion Remaster release date. There is very little information surrounding the project, including whether it’s still happening. Unlike with the Fallout franchise, there’s less of a wait time from this point until the launch of The Elder Scrolls VI, though we still don’t have an official release date for that title either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-reveals-homelander-gameplay-fatalities-and-a-first-look-at-ferra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Warner Bros. Games has revealed gameplay for Homelander, the next DLC character for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p><p>Homelander, who is based on the supervillain from Prime Video’s mega hit show <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-boys">The Boys</a>, appears as a guest DLC character in NetherRealm’s gory fighting game, and based on the gameplay trailer below, the ‘evil Superman’ is a good fit.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander joins the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> roster on June 4, Ferra Kameo joins later in June. Check out their game-play here!<a href="https://t.co/QIjuLCEPWe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/QIjuLCEPWe</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1795805484336734606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Here's the official blurb on Homelander:</p><blockquote>Homelander is the most powerful being on the planet and the leader of The Seven, the elite superhero team owned and managed by Vought International. In a world where “Supes” are made, he’s the strongest of them all. Homelander presents himself as the ultimate patriot and protector, but don’t let his movie star good looks or high approval rating fool you. He is a murderous, narcissistic sociopath with an insatiable need for validation, love, and power. Homelander’s destruction of enemies and lust for power does not end with his world. Challengers from other realms will also face his wrath. As seen in the new video, Homelander asserts dominance over opponents through his super strength, aerial attacks, and capacity to laser enemies with his eyes. </blockquote><p>If you can get through Homelander’s disgusting milk-drinking victory pose, you’ll see he uses his famous laser eyes in much of his combo building, as a launcher, an interrupt, as well as a combo extender. Indeed, the laser eyes are the basis of one of Homelander’s Fatalities, which we get a glimpse at at the end of the clip.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143348-1716989639063.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Mortal Kombat 1 fans have wondered who Homelander might differ from similar Superman-style characters already in the game, such as Omni-Man from the Invincible series. Based on the gameplay trailer, we can see Homelander shares many abilities with Omni-Man, such as flight and heavy hitting attacks, but the difference appears to be in speed and, again, those laser eyes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143110-1716989487729.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Warner Bros. has remained coy about the voice actor behind Mortal Kombat 1’s Homelander. Antony Starr, who plays Homelander in The Boys, has said he is not voicing the character in the game, much to the disappointment of fans. Omni-Man voice actor J. K. Simmons reprised his role for Mortal Kombat 1, as did Peacemaker actor John Cena. It is unclear why Starr did not do the same here. Still, fans will be able to live out their Homelander versus Omni-Man fantasies through Mortal Kombat 1 when the character is made available next month.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143232-1716989566907.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Meanwhile, we also get a look at Kameo character Ferra, who Homelander uses to set up a number of combos. Ferra is the small fighter who sat atop the hulking Torr as part of the combined Ferra &amp; Torr character from Mortal Kombat X. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143542-1716989748027.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Homelander hits Mortal Kombat 1 on June 4 for early access players, followed by wide availability on June 11, whereas Ferra has a June release window. You need the Premium Edition or the Kombat Pack to play early. The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now), and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (available now), Homelander (out soon), and Takeda Takahashi, as well as five DLC Kameo fighters. The Boys Season 4, meanwhile, kicks off June 13.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<!-- cache hit 57:single/related:6c0ba3ba2b41590cf5a3e0b4ee10bcfd --><!-- empty -->
<p>The families of multiple victims of the 2022 mass shooting at Uvalde's Robb Elementary School are suing Activision in a California civil court, alleging that the company's <em>Call of Duty</em> games act as a "training camp for mass shooters."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon">The lawsuit</a> (as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit">obtained by Polygon</a>) compares Activision's <em>Call of Duty</em> marketing to the cigarette industry's use of <a href="https://tobacco.stanford.edu/cigarettes/cartoons/joe-camel-cartoons/">now-barred spokescartoon Joe Camel</a>, putting the gaming company "in the wildly lucrative business of training adolescents to become gunmen." The <em>Call of Duty</em> games "are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters," the lawsuit alleges, and in Uvalde, the games "knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him how to use it."</p>
<p>Meta platforms is also a party to the lawsuit for "explicit, aggressive marketing" of firearms to minors via Instagram.</p>
<h2>Too real</h2>
<p>While <em>Call of Duty</em> may have started as a mere video game, the lawsuit argues that more recent versions have crossed the line into a realistic "simulation" that "enables the operator to reproduce or represent under test condition phenomena likely to occur in actual performance." The extreme realism in the game desensitizes players to killing in familiar environments like malls, airports, and restaurants, the suit says, and exposes "high-school aged boys with developing brains" to "morally complex situations with an assault weapon."</p>
<p>By "manipulating players' brain chemistry so that killing was associated with dopamine release, reward, and/or pleasure," the suit alleges that the games cause a "real life physical and neurological response" that some users are likely to try to replicate in the real world. "It is highly foreseeable that the addictive and hyper-realistic content of Call of Duty products will lead some users, including minors, to attempt or achieve the real-life enactment of what the Call of Duty products simulate so effectively, including the use of firearms for mass killing," the suit alleges.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, the American Psychological Association <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games">said</a> that "violent video game play is linked to increased aggression in players." But in a 2020 update, the APA clarified that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/apa-warns-against-linking-violent-video-games-to-real-world-violence/">there was no statistical link</a> between exposure to violent video games and incidence of real-world violence, affirming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/meta-analysis-uncovers-no-real-link-between-violence-and-gaming/">earlier meta-analyses</a> on the topic.
</p><p>In a statement provided to Polygon, an Activision spokesperson said that “the Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Academic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.”</p>
<h2>Real virtual guns</h2>
<p>The lawsuit pays particular attention to Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">long-standing licensing agreements with real-world gun manufacturers</a>, which bring additional realism to the games while promoting the gun-makers' products. Gun-maker memos cited in the lawsuit show how the industry feels that "a primary means for young potential shooters to come into contact with firearms and ammunition is through virtual gaming scenarios." And while the specific brands of those guns are not highlighted in the game itself, the lawsuit lays out significant evidence that gun buyers seek out the real versions of the weapons they use in the <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p>
<p>"In service of... their bottom line, Activision created a firearm showroom for its millions of users—one where adults and teenagers alike could browse, test, covet, and compare each weapon's capacity to kill," the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/codweapons.png" data-height="759" data-width="1000" alt="Some of the weapons that appear in <em>Call of Duty</em> games."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/codweapons.png" data-height="759" data-width="1000">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Some of the weapons that appear in <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Daniel Defense, which manufactured the actual gun used in the Uvalde shooting, is not a defendant in the suit. While the plaintiffs say the gun maker's actions are "contemptible, reckless, and at times unlawful," it adds that the company "cannot reach its target demographic, teenagers and young men, without the substantial and critical assistance of the Defendants."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 4 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The patch notes include weapon balancing for Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, including a huge nerf for the popular BP50 assault rifle. The gun now has a 4% decrease to movement speed and sprint speed, as well as a 13% reduction to the maximum damage range, 11% less near-medium damage, and 8% decrease to the medium damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Several submachine guns are buffed to have increased damage ranges, with the list including Season 3's FJX Horus, the RAM-9, AMR9, Rival-9, HRM-9, Striker-9, Striker, and WSP-9.</p><p dir="ltr">A few perks are corrected in the big update. It fixed an issue with the Gunslinger Vest, which previously caused Throwing Star kills not to refresh stamina, and it corrected the issue that caused Throwing Star kills not to trigger health regeneration with the Compression Carrier Vest equipped.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 also makes several adjustments to killstreaks, which should hopefully make them feel more effective. The Precision Airstrike now has a 17% increase to the explosive damage radius, the Cruise Missile received a 50% increase, and the SAE has a 7% increase to the explosive damage radius as well. For the Carpet Bomb, the streak is decreased in price from 10 kills or 1,250 score down to eight kills or 1,000 score, the explosive damage radius is increased by 25%, and the flight speed of the bomber is now 40% faster.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side, the update includes several fixes for bugs and stability issues. This includes a correction for a bug that previously prevented players from activating the third punching bag in the Tattered MMA Gloves attunement challenge, and fixes a problem that previously caused a loss of weapons when dying while the Juggernaut suit was active.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309946" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309946"></a><figcaption>Season 4 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The big highlight for Warzone's Season 4 update is the raised player count in standard battle royale mode, with the increase from 100 to 120 players per match. The developer addresses these changes by saying, "Player feedback continues to indicate a desire for more action. So with that in mind, we have made the necessary changes to accommodate a higher player count without disrupting the delicate balance" of the matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes also arrived to the Urzikstan map. Exit hatches were added to the open bunkers to provide an additional escape route, and the Gulag now has a silo setting with four different map layouts to provide more variation to the 1v1 arena. A circle change is also made to delay the time before the initial circle begins to shrink on the map, which is increased from one to two minutes, and the developer says this change was made to give players more time to find bunkers and also adjusts the match pacing to fit 120 players.</p><p dir="ltr">A stealing feature is added to the Champion's Quest nuke challenges across all maps and modes. When a team with the Champion's Quest contract is fully eliminated, the quest tablet will drop and the first team that interacts with the tablet can now steal the contract and continue the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h3>WELCOME TO SEASON 4</h3><p>Welcome to Season 4 of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III!</p><p>Before you jump into all of the new content this Season offers, read the Patch Notes below for the latest balance adjustments, gameplay improvements, bug fixes, and other changes.</p><p>Pre-download the Season 4 update now on all platforms and get started at 9 AM PT.</p><h3>NEW MAPS</h3><p>The fog of war goes global.

Wanting to be with Hammer for as long as possible, Manoel trained him as a working dog, and enrolled in the military with Hammer by his side.

100.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In an effort to enhance the Battle Royale experience on Urzikstan, we've decided to increase the number of players in each match from 100 to 120.</p><p>Our initial design intent at the launch of Modern Warfare 3 was to focus on mid-game pacing, ensuring a steady and consistent build-up throughout the match. To strike a balance between matchmaking times, client performance, and match pacing, we initially centered our game balance around 100 players. This required extensive revisions and balancing across various aspects of the game, including early game looting, engagement times, weapon damage, armor values, movement mechanics, redeploy mechanics, economy, and strategic and defensive tools. We’re proud to say that overall we’ve been quite pleased with the results over the past few seasons.</p><p>That said, player feedback continues to indicate a desire for more action. So with that in mind, we have made the necessary changes to accommodate a higher player count without disrupting the delicate balance we have worked hard to achieve. This time around, these adjustments have been primarily focused around redeploy mechanics and our match economy.</p><p>Gulag tokens now have a low chance to appear in general loot, with specific spawn rates from different chest types and guaranteed availability from Most Wanted and buy stations. Redeploy tokens are now part of a new tier of legendary items and have specific spawn conditions to maintain balance. Additionally, redeploy flares have a controlled spawn rate in legendary chests and other support item locations.</p><p>Our goal with the economy is to make cash more meaningful and create clearer paths for acquiring key items. We've slightly reduced the amount of cash found in loot, increased the number of supply boxes, updated the cost of buy station items, and adjusted the rarity of certain items to promote a more engaging and strategic looting experience.</p><p>With all these changes live in Season 4, we aim to deliver a more strategic experience that emphasizes risk-reward while maintaining consistent, action-packed pacing throughout the match. As always, our team will be carefully monitoring internal data as well as external player feedback - and adjustments will be made where necessary as we move forward.</p><h2>MAPS</h2><h3><b><u>MAP UPDATES</u></b></h3><h4>» URZIKSTAN «</h4><ul><li><b>Bunkers</b><ul><li>Unlocked bunkers now have an escape hatch as an alternative exit.</li><li>New rewards have been added to various locations.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Gulag</b><ul><li>4 new Gulag layouts have been added:  <ul><li>S: Stacked equipment and L-shaped plywood walls with an S-shaped central wall over the circular floor grate.</li><li>2: A three-panel curved wall, stacked equipment against two walled sections, and two curved inner walls above the circular floor grate.</li><li>3: Stacked equipment against two walled sections, with concrete L-shaped walls around the central circular floor grate.</li><li>8: A rectangular concrete barrier wall outside long central section around the central circular floor grate with one plywood wall sprayed with a blue “8”.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>MODES</h2><h3><b><u>RETURNING</u></b></h3><h4>» URZIKSTAN | BATTLE ROYALE «</h4><ul><li><b>Buy Back Royale</b><ul><li>Cash is everything in this returning game mode.

                <p>For the first time since 2014, EA is releasing a college football game--and people are pretty excited about. EA Sports College Football releases in July behind a mountain of hype and some notable changes.</p><p>First up, EA is no longer working with the NCAA, which is why the series has changed names. In another big step, the game features real player names and likenesses thanks to the Name, Image, Likeness, (NIL) program in college sports. Players are being paid for their appearance in the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports College Football 25 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While the NCAA is not involved in EA Sports College Football, EA has separately struck deals with the relevant rights-owners to secure 134 FBS schools, including their stadiums, fight songs, mascots, and thousands of players.</p><p>In this post we're rounding up everything we know about EA Sports College Football 25, including the game's release date, platforms, new gameplay features, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Who_s_on_the_cover_of_EA_Sports_College_Football_25_">Who's on the cover of EA Sports College Football 25?</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_release_date">EA Sports College Football 25 release date</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_platforms">EA Sports College Football 25 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_price">EA Sports College Football 25 price</a></li><li><a href="#What_s_new_in_EA_Sports_College_Football_25_">What's new in EA Sports College Football 25?</a></li><li><a href="#Why_is_NCAA_not_involved_">Why is NCAA not involved?</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_pre_orders">EA Sports College Football 25 pre-orders</a></li></ul></div><p>The cover of EA Sports College Football 25 has three athletes on it: Michigan running back Donovan Edwards, Texas QB Quinn Ewers, and Colorado wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. These athletes are on the standard and deluxe covers. The MVP bundle, which includes copies of EA Sports College Football and Madden NFL 25, doesn't have any specific cover stars.</p><p>EA Sports College Football 25 releases on July 19. People who buy the Deluxe Edition can start playing on July 16. Additionally, there is a free 10-hour trial that begins on July 16 via EA Play.</p><p>EA Sports College Football 25 will be released across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. There is no version of the game for PS4/Xbox One or PC.</p><p>The new college football game is priced at $70 for the standard edition, $100 for the Deluxe edition, and $150 for the MVP bundle. Head to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/" data-ref-id="1100-6523506">GameSpot's EA Sports College Football 25 pre-order</a> guide to learn more.</p><p>The first thing fans may notice is that EA Sports College Football 25 simply looks a lot better than the last entry in the series. After all, it's been 10 years--which is an eternity in the video game space.</p><p>EA says player ratings are constantly changing throughout the game, so players will need to leverage their strategy skills and execution on the sticks to win. The game also has a "wear and tear" system, so when "the hits add up, players wear down." You will have to to manage your players' health, fatigue, and injuries to lead your team to victory.</p><p>A "pre-snap recognition" feature is now in the game, too, which means every snap matters more, EA said. What's more, EA Sports College Football 25 has a homefield advantage system that makes it harder for away teams to win at the toughest arenas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309319-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4309319" data-ratio="0.55872483221477" data-width="1192" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309319-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4309319"></a><figcaption>EA Sports College Football 25 is almost here</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309319-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309321-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309322-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309323-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.20pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309324-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.26pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309325-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.32pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309326-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.39pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4309321,1300-4309322,1300-4309323,1300-4309324,1300-4309325,1300-4309326" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309321-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309322-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309323-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.20pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309324-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.26pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309325-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.32pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309326-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.39pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309321-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309322-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309323-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.20pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309324-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.26pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309325-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.32pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309326-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.39pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of game modes, EA Sports College Football 25 has a Dynasty mode that has players creating a coach and controlling a team through a season. This includes fine details like creating a coaching staff and even using the transfer portal. Then there is Road to Glory, which is a mode where players create a player and take them through all facets of the game, from getting a solid GPA in the classroom to excelling on the field and potentially winning a Heisman.</p><p>Of course, EA Sports College Football 25 has an Ultimate Team component. Similar to how it works in EA's other roster of sports games, players can build a "dream team" and put their teams to the test in single-player challenges or against the community online. This being Ultimate Team, it can be safely assumed this mode will feature a wide array of microtransactions and loot boxes.</p><p>There is also a Road to the CFP mode that gives players a "new way to play competitively" as they try to take their favorite team to the College Football Playoffs and ultimately the National Championship.</p><h2 id="Why_is_NCAA_not_involved_">Why is NCAA not involved?</h2><p>EA Sports worked with the NCAA on numerous college football games over the years, but the partnership ended with 2013's NCAA Football 14 due to a variety of issues, including player lawsuits. A decade later, EA opted to break off its relationship with the NCAA and instead sign licensing deals with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) and others to get the rights to the 134 FBS schools in the game, along with team-specific elements like stadiums, fight songs, mascots, and more. Fans of college football know that the "gameday experience" includes much more than just school names, after all.</p><p>EA Sports College Football 25 is available now to pre-order, and there are a number of different editions to choose from.

        <p>Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus inclusion brings Immortals of Aveum into the Top 10</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The success of Amazon's Fallout TV series continues to shape the games industry's charts, as Circana reveals that Fallout 4, 76, and New Vegas were among the most-played games in the US last month.</p>
<p>Circana has released its engagement charts for April 2024, which show Fallout 4 in the Top 10 for all three platforms that it tracks: No.8 for PlayStation 5, No.6 for Xbox Series X|S, and No.4 on Steam.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fallout 76 reached No.5 on Steam and No.10 on Xbox, with the Obsidian-developed Fallout: New Vegas appearing at No.8 in the Steam rankings based on monthly active users.</p>
<p>The appearance of these games comes as no surprise; the acclaim for the television show based on the Fallout series and streamed through Amazon Prime has seen Bethesda's post-apocalyptic RPGs rise up the sales charts in the UK, Europe and the US.</p>
<p>In fact, Circana revealed today that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-game-spending-experienced-a-3-decrease-in-april-us-monthly-charts">Fallout 4 was the fifth best-selling game in the US for April 2024</a>, with Fallout 76 as the eighth.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the engagement charts, fantasy shooter Immortals of Aveum leapt more than 280 places in the PS5 rankings thanks to its inclusion as one of the monthly games for PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>The only new entry in any of the most-played charts was Landfall Games' Content Warning, at No.3 on Steam, due to a slow month for major launches.</p>
<p>The most played games were more predictable, with Call of Duty on PlayStation, Fortnite on Xbox, and Helldivers 2 marking its third consecutive month at the top on Steam.</p>
<p>Below are the ten most played games on PlayStation 5 based on monthly active users:</p>

The game would follow a hero traveling to a fantasy kingdom of living sweets, making friends, and fighting a mysterious antagonist. This fairy tale concept shaped our entire game design approach in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess — Let’s Play Jolly Battle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had it, our first stop was obvious: it had to look good, like a kids book, which meant developing a rich, kid-appropriate visual style. And just like a good fairy tale, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had to be captivating from start to finish, never once losing the attention of its players. Our solution: prioritize player engagement, make the game modular and constantly rotate level types and gameplay scenarios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, we knew what we were building. The only problem was finding a way to build it — and on a resource-constrained platform, no less.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We needed some kind of magic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="When game design goals meet platform constraints">When game design goals meet platform constraints</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any developer of a family-oriented game is in a tough spot. If mechanics and environments are monotonous, our target audience gets bored </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which meant that our gameplay loop should constantly stimulate the players’ attention. To add variability and keep the players’ attention span in check, we used various types of spatial arrangement for every level and mechanics. Standing shooting levels, railway shooting, logic puzzles, rhythmic levels, boss fights — you name it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the decision to release on an Android-based platform meant we had a limited amount of resources to play with. We had to optimize the game’s performance while keeping the visuals as detailed as possible — super difficult given the platform’s hardware limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply put, we had to pick our battles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers of traditional PC games can often rely on taking advantage of the performance of high-end gaming PCs. But your options are way more limited when you develop a project for an all-in-one VR device.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One significant constraint is the processing power of the Meta Quest devices, which may restrict the complexity of graphics, physics simulations, and AI computations. Additionally, memory constraints limit the size of game assets and textures, requiring careful optimization to ensure smooth performance. Moreover, the limited input options, such as the Oculus Touch controllers, necessitate innovative design solutions to create intuitive and immersive gameplay experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But we still had ambitious goals in mind. We wanted the game to feature a beautiful visual style, immersive world, entertaining and captivating gameplay, and elaborate narrative. We wanted to make it a fairy tale!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve the balance between performance and level of detail, we had to outline the optimization methods very early in the development process — way back at the sketching stage. If you start working on it later, you will likely have to redo the work from the beginning.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An Aside: Level progression and the importance of mini-games">An Aside: Level progression and the importance of mini-games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the story mode, players gain access to new levels in a particular sequence:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Static Level → On-rails Level → Puzzle Level → Boss Level →&nbsp; Rhythm Level</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The player learns to shoot during the initial levels and gets used to various tools at their disposal. The puzzle levels give the player a breather before the boss fights. Once the boss level is over, the player can rest from shooting during a rhythm-based level, which is also an opportunity to earn some coins to unlock and improve guns for the next boss level.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This sequence remains in place for the whole game. The only exception is the last, 10th level, which is a singular boss fight that closes the campaign.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Our approach to level design">Our approach to level design</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We always start our level design process with a concept phase, beginning with a Blueprint representing the placement of every object in a particular scene. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess — Let’s Play Jolly Battle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, our next step was blocking the scenery. Blocking is another crucial element of visual design that determines the layout of the in-game map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s the step-by-step overview of our approach:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create several blocks on the perimeter, including buildings, big objects, and other elements of scenery serving as limits of the map</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Transfer this part of the structure into the editor and test every 3D object to check whether they work well within general gameplay. If there’s something wrong with a scene’s composition or gameplay, it’s much easier to fix at this stage.</span></p></div></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Full-scale testing of the detailed scene</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the 3D models are in place, we start working with textures and light sources. If extra optimization is needed, developers can employ baking and pattern atlases. That’s what we did in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, saving even more resources.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An Aside: Ambiance">An Aside: Ambiance</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Level ambiance is crucial when creating a family-oriented VR game. The right kind of ambiance makes the game feel unique and exciting to the player… just like a good fairy tale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several levels in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are set in their dedicated environments. These environments are still based on the primary Sugar Realm setting but switch things up just enough to keep the player entertained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, our team used various particles, VFX effects, and sounds to immerse a player in the scene and enhance the player's immersion.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The need for optimization">The need for optimization</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To keep performance high when the visuals are loading, all objects in the foreground, middle ground, and background should be optimized. But those bright and colorful objects are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>exactly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> what draws the players’ attention in a family-oriented game!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A high level of detail (LOD) impacts memory and CPU, demanding intense rendering and increasing the file size. Basically, we had to carefully choose which groups of objects will have different LODs depending on their size, importance, and distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here are a few examples:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The LOD value for mobs that move toward the player is 2,500 polygons</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Large objects located at a medium distance, such as barrels, have a value of LOD-1000</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The towers situated further away need to be</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">less</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">detailed, so their value is LOD-500</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Generally, you have three options when it comes to designing 3D models:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Go for near-perfect high-poly geometry</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opt for a lightweight, low-poly mesh</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Use mid-poly models that are detailed enough but use fewer resources than high-poly</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That last option is the middle road we took with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> – all objects in the foreground are built with optimized mid-poly 3D details.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have also swapped all 3D objects in the background and the 3D backgrounds themselves for 2D illustrations. That’s how we’ve got those picturesque skyboxes with images of the sky, faraway objects, and the horizon, while also keeping them very lightweight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also used other optimization tricks and psychological cues. For example, to draw the player’s attention to an interactive object, we used leading lines, highlights, or emphasized them with a surrounding composition. This way, we guided the player through the level and showed them new opportunities… While keeping their eye away from some of the cutbacks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The stylized visuals demand optimization and resource efficiency. Since we’re not moving objects during gameplay, we didn’t have to create lighting from different angles, allowing us to choose baking over real-time lighting — another win to balance the level of detail and performance. Good topology is crucial at this stage, ensuring meshes with baked textures and lighting are free of artifacts and uniformly cover object shapes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The chosen ‘fairy tale cartoon’ setting allowed us to further optimize on the visuals. When depicting an object (such as a tree) using fairy tale visual stylization, you can replace </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>thousands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of 2D images of leaves with just a few polygons. The object will look no less beautiful, and loading the image will occur without difficulty. Just imagine the performance gains!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An Aside: Balancing and testing a family-friendly game">An Aside: Balancing and testing a family-friendly game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game for all ages requires considering each family member's interests and abilities. This calls for game mechanics that are equally accessible to both experienced players and total rookies… And we spent a lot of time making sure we got it right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We consulted multiple focus groups of players of varying ages and gaming experience. During these sessions, players were encouraged to provide feedback on their overall gameplay experience, including any challenges they encountered or aspects they found enjoyable. By observing and analyzing player interactions, we identified common pain points and usability issues.&nbsp; Additionally, testers were asked to rate their level of immersion, comfort, and engagement to gauge the effectiveness of the game's design in delivering a satisfying VR experience for players of all ages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The insights from playtests were vital in shaping the game's UX. For example, if players struggled to transfer weapons from hand to hand, our team would explore alternative mechanics for grabbing weapons to improve accessibility and make it intuitive. Sometimes, it involved implementing a simplified control scheme or introducing visual cues to more effectively guide player interactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feedback regarding motion discomfort prompted adjustments to locomotion mechanics, such as implementing a vignette view to enhance player comfort during gameplay. By iteratively refining the game based on playtest feedback, our team aimed to create a seamless and enjoyable VR experience that catered to the needs and preferences of its diverse player base.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="In conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making a family-friendly VR game for an Android-based platform taught us a few valuable lessons, especially about the importance of optimization in level design. Meticulous visual optimization and resource management allowed us to achieve smooth performance and rich visuals, making the overall experience just a bit more… fairy tale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving forward, we’d like to emphasize several key takeaways for fellow developers:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prioritize visual optimization to maintain a consistent frame rate and minimize performance issues.

This balance was achieved through a combination of careful planning and creative experimentation. The new ‘Yars Rising’ features hacking elements and side-view exploration, which add depth and complexity to the gameplay. “Hacking is a central mechanic in the new game,” James explained. “It allows players to interact with the game world in unique ways, creating opportunities for strategic thinking and problem-solving.” This innovative approach not only pays homage to the original game’s puzzle-solving aspects but also introduces a fresh layer of engagement for players.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Hacking is a central mechanic in the new game.

It allows players to interact with the game world in unique ways, creating opportunities for strategic thinking and problem-solving."</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Throughout the development process, community feedback played a vital role in shaping the game’s direction. “We actively sought input from players who were familiar with the original game as well as those who were new to the franchise,” James shared. This feedback was invaluable in refining gameplay mechanics and ensuring that the new ‘Yars Rising’ would appeal to a broad audience. The involvement of the gaming community also extended to playtesting, where players had the opportunity to experience early versions of the game and provide constructive feedback. “Playtesting is a crucial part of our development process,” James emphasized. “It allows us to identify potential issues and make necessary adjustments before the final release.”</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="WayForward’s Passion for Gaming History"><span>WayForward’s Passion for Gaming History</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">WayForward’s success in reimagining classic games can be attributed to the studio’s deep passion for gaming history and its commitment to quality. “Our team is comprised of individuals who genuinely love video games and are dedicated to preserving their legacy,” James remarked. This passion is evident in the meticulous attention to detail that characterizes WayForward’s projects. In addition to ‘Yars Rising,’ WayForward has worked on numerous other titles that celebrate the rich history of video games. “We’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that honor classic games while bringing something new to the table,” James said. This dedication to preserving gaming history while pushing the boundaries of creativity has earned WayForward a reputation as one of the industry’s most respected studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The journey of reimagining ‘Yars Rising’ was not without its challenges. James candidly discussed the obstacles his team faced, from technical difficulties to creative differences. “Every project has its hurdles, and ‘Yars Rising’ was no exception,” he admitted. “There were moments when we questioned whether certain ideas would work, but perseverance and collaboration ultimately led us to success.” One of the technical challenges involved updating the game’s graphics and animations while maintaining the visual style of the original. “We wanted the new game to look polished and modern, but it was essential to keep the visual elements that fans of the original would recognize and appreciate,” James explained. This task required a careful balance of artistry and technical expertise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As our conversation drew to a close, James shared his thoughts on the future of game development. “The industry is constantly evolving, and it’s an exciting time to be a part of it,” he said. “Technological advancements are opening up new possibilities for game design, and the potential for innovation is limitless.” He also emphasized the importance of staying true to one’s creative vision while remaining adaptable to changing trends and player preferences. “It’s essential to keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in game development while never losing sight of what makes games fun and engaging,” James concluded.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Personal Reflections"><span>Personal Reflections</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reflecting on my conversation with James Montagna, I am struck by the dedication and passion that drive his work. His commitment to honoring gaming history while embracing innovation is a testament to the evolving nature of the industry. As a game developer myself, I am inspired by his approach and motivated to continue pushing the boundaries of creativity in my own projects. The journey of reimagining a classic like ‘Yars Rising’ is a reminder of the enduring appeal of video games and their ability to captivate players across generations. It also underscores the importance of community, collaboration, and a shared love for the art of game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In conclusion, my conversation with James Montagna provided a fascinating insight into the challenges and triumphs of reimagining classic games. Through his experiences and reflections, I gained a deeper appreciation for the delicate balance required to honor the past while innovating for the future. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the work of passionate developers like James and the team at WayForward serves as a beacon of inspiration, guiding us toward a future where creativity and tradition coexist harmoniously.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Our team is comprised of individuals who genuinely love video games and are dedicated to preserving their legacy.&quot;">"Our team is comprised of individuals who genuinely love video games and are dedicated to preserving their legacy."</h3><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="SELECTED LINKS FROM THE EPISODE"><span>SELECTED LINKS FROM THE EPISODE</span></h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/05/29/hive-jump-2-survivors-premieres-new-trailer-to-coincide-with-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/08/30/the-best-indies-to-watch-from-pax-2015.aspx">one of the most promising indie titles</a> on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b4e6b9b-14ea-4052-b0b0-cd51648d523d" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/vampire-survivors/single-stick-masterpiece">Vampire Survivors</a>.</p>

<p>The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.</p>

<p>The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.</p>

<p>You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.</p>

<p>In grade school, I would religiously play through The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in any spare time I could find between studying and schoolwork. It was my escape from reality. That is, until Bethesda unveiled Fallout 3 in July of 2004. Now, here we all are, much older and impatiently waiting for the next mainline Fallout game to launch. In the meantime, do we know the Fallout 3 Remaster release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-getting-a-remaster">Is Fallout 3 Getting a Remaster?</h2>



<p>The word around town—by town, I mean the games industry—is that a Fallout 3 Remaster is currently in the works. As revealed by the ZeniMax Management Forecast, which leaked during the FTC case, several projects are underway. Of course, this could change. Microsoft and Bethesda may choose to abandon projects. Still, following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-series-65-million-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success of the Fallout TV series</a>, along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-was-always-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rising popularity of Fallout 76</a>, it would be an absolutely missed opportunity not to capitalize on the hype. </p>



<p>The problem, however, is that Fallout 5 is still many years away. In the interim, we need more Fallout, and the most efficient way to deliver is by remaking or remastering past titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fallout-3-remaster-release-date">When is the Fallout 3 Remaster Release Date?</h2>



<p>As of right now, we do not have a Fallout 4 Remaster release date. There’s no official confirmation of the game’s arrival besides a few leaks and rumors, but it’s certainly likely.</p>



<p>In the past, Todd Howard stated that he didn’t like remakes and remasters and, as such, didn’t want Bethesda working on such projects. However, that’s likely to change under new management at Microsoft and Xbox. Microsoft wants to capitalize on the immense popularity of the Fallout brand, which is currently sweeping the globe, and the timeframe for the next single-player title doesn’t work into their earnings calls very well!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sony pulled the interview less than a week later, offering a statement which reads in part: "In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects)." Sony further apologized to Druckmann for "misrepresenting his words."</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear how exactly this sort of thing can happen in an internal company interview, or why it took Sony so long to remove the interview entirely. In recent Naughty Dog news, Jeffrey Wright (who played Isaac in The Last Of Us: Part II) was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-casts-jeffrey-wright-in-same-role-as-the-game/1100-6523708/" data-ref-id="1100-6523708">cast to play the same role</a> in the upcoming second season of the TV show, which is based on the sequel.</p>

        <p>Convenience is the No.1 reason people are signing-up to video game subscription services</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft told us that one in ten people who subscribe to its Ubisoft+ service are entirely new to Ubisoft's games.</p>
<p>The data suggests some gamers are partially treating the service to trial or even rent a game they might be interested in, before unsubscribing. In October, Ubisoft saw a record number of subscribers who signed up, presumably, for Assassin's Creed Mirage.</p>
<p>The firm didn't share exact figures, and they're unlikely to be significant, but there's some evidence that subscription has unlocked some new customers for Ubisoft, if not necessarily the games industry at large.</p>
<p>It prompted us to get in touch with Newzoo to see if we can understand a bit more about who is subscribing to these services, and why.</p>
<p>According to the data firm's Global Gamer Study, the majority of subscribers are in Western markets (North America, Europe, and Australasia). They're mostly men (62%) and aged between 21 and 35 (42%).</p>
<p>And unsurprisingly, they're gamers. 52% of subscribers consider video games their favourite hobby, with 34% spending more than six hours per week on console games, and 32% spending the same the same amount of time on PC games.</p>
<p>Overall, subscription users were already average spenders of PC and console games (spending roughly $5 to $25 a month on games).</p>
<p>Interestingly, subscription users tend to have a higher income level (43%) compared with non-subscribers (34%). The definition of 'higher income' varies by country, but in the US that's anyone over $100,000 a year.</p>
<p>It suggests that, although value and saving money is clearly a big motivation for subscribers, it isn't the biggest reason why most gamers subscribe to the likes of Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online and others.</p>
<p>In fact, Newzoo suggests that "the potential cost savings may not be sufficient to justify the subscription for those with lower income values."</p>
<p>Its data says that "discounts or cost savings compared to buying games separately" is no more motivating to low-income gamers (31% cite this as a reason for subscribing) than it is for those on a high-income (also 31%). Low-income gamers are those earning less than $50,000 a year (and again, varies by country).</p>
<p>However, cost-savings/discounts is the joint No.1 motivation for low-income gamers, alongside "enjoying multiplayer features and online gaming." Indeed, that latter reason is the No.2 reason for subscribing for both middle- and higher-income players. (Middle-income gamers are those earning between $50,000 and $100,000).</p>
<p>The No.1 reason for mid- or high-income players when it comes to subscribing to a service is the "convenience of trying out new games instead of buying them individually." 35% of mid-income players and 38% of high-income players cite convenience as a motivator, vs 30% for low-income players.</p>
