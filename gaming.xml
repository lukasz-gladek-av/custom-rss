In 2022 he was hired to work at Blizzard on quality assurance for the sequel’s versus modes and matchmaking. </p><p>Hendrick has had up to eight game clients running simultaneously to test for issues and keeps a Corgi plush (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/22753874/the-legendary-corgi-plush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/22753874/the-legendary-corgi-plush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“a mascot of Irvine campus #blizzlife”</a></span>) by his work desk. On Thursdays he meets colleagues in the Blizzard Irvine campus library to play <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. When I asked him what he loves most about working there, his answer was the same as everyone else’s: the people. </p><p>When nearly 2,000 layoffs swept through Microsoft last year, including at Blizzard where a new game was canceled and several members of the<em> Overwatch </em>team were cut, it was a wake up call for Hedrick.  “People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it,” he said. ‘What I want to protect most here is the people’</p><p>The post-merger shockwave—Microsoft had officially wrapped its acquisition of Activision Blizzard only months earlier—was one catalyst for the organizing effort at Blizzard’s Team 4, which was originally formed in the late 2000s to create the company’s planned MMO <em>Titan</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before the troubled project eventually morphed into <em>Overwatch</em></a></span>.

He loves making games and wants developers to have a seat at the table, not just to protect their own interests but to make the games better, to prioritize fun and not just profit. “For a long time time I felt the video game industry needed more organizing,” he told <em>Kotaku</em>. He later added, “It’s been 20 years of asking for better pay and it hasn’t happened yet.”</p><p>2025 is an important year for <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Despite ditching much of its promised PVE content, the hero shooter rolled out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919?_gl=1*cdl2dx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY4MDI1NjQkbzgyJGcxJHQxNzQ2ODAyNTc1JGo0OSRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919?_gl=1*cdl2dx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY4MDI1NjQkbzgyJGcxJHQxNzQ2ODAyNTc1JGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">some big-swing design initiatives</a></span>, including a new mode called Stadium that incorporates MOBA elements like mid-match upgrades. Season 16 is currently underway and the team just announced a<em> Street Fighter VI</em> collaboration <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908">that all but transforms existing characters</a></span> into Capcom fighters like Ryu and Chun-Li.</p><p>The effort to unionize the <em>Overwatch</em> team hasn’t just led by quality assurance testers. Other disciplines were also involved. UI artist Sadie Boyd became part of the push immediately after joining Blizzard last September, just as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another round of layoffs</a></span> was sweeping through Microsoft. She said someone posted a link to sign a union card in one of the Blizzard Slack channels, which she did immediately. After all, she’d already been part of a union drive at <em>Prey </em>and <em>Redfall </em>maker Arkane Austin before it had been shut down by Microsoft earlier in the year. </p><p>“We’re not just a number on an Excel sheet,” Boyd said. “We want to make games but we can’t do it without a sense of security.” Unionizing doesn’t make a studio immune to layoffs or being shuttered, but it’s the first step toward making companies have a discussion about those things with employees rather than just shadow-dropping them in an email full of platitudes. Boyd sees the <em>Overwatch</em> union as a tool for negotiating a range of issues, like if and how generative AI is used at Blizzard, as well as a possible source of inspiration to teams at other studios. </p><p>“Our industry is at such a turning point,” she said. “I really think with the announcement of our union on <em>Overwatch</em>...I know that will light some fires.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>DOOM, a series likely thought dead during its twelve-year hiatus (not including re-releases) between DOOM 3 and 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM reboot</a>, is on a high. The success of DOOM, followed by the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM Eternal</a>, means it was inevitable that a new release would come. What I didn't expect was the direction of that, which is where DOOM: The Dark Ages comes in.</p>
<p>By abandoning multiplayer and opting for a pure single-player and narrative-focused experience, DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the series somewhere different and a little medieval.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. It focuses on an earlier incursion of hell and explains why the Doom Slayer is who he is. Long story short, the Makyrs essentially had him tethered as their slave-weapon, keeping him trapped unless they needed him, just pointing him towards the demons they wanted killed. The series has never really been narrative-heavy, and I'm not going to pretend that it somehow is now, but I do like what they've done here.</p>
<p>Despite his general lack of depth, the Doom Slayer is a surprisingly good character. In the previous games, you could understand perfectly what he was thinking in every circumstance, and that thought is essentially "Kill demons, F- everything else". While he's already in this frame of mind, you will get to see more of his time while under the control of the Makyr, during the invasion of Argent D'nur. You will also meet far more characters than in any other title in the series (that I remember). Where the lore in previous games was relegated to reading the codex entries, here you get it through cutscenes and other monologues. The Doom Slayer is still as vocal as always.</p>
<p>I won't cover more of the story to avoid spoilers, but I've enjoyed the change in direction. This is despite my saying in my DOOM Eternal review that I don't care about the story in a DOOM game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Let's be brutally honest: most people don't come into a DOOM game because of its narrative, including DOOM: The Dark Ages. Having it, and a good one, is just the icing on the extremely bloody and demonic cake. No, people come for the gameplay, the gory fun stuff, and I would argue that it's fun. Clearing what may be a sticking point for some people, I don't care about the lack of a multiplayer mode. Most people know me enough that a multiplayer mode is usually a negative, not a positive.</p>
<p>Rather than including multiplayer, DOOM: The Dark Ages includes the longest campaign in the series. Across 22 different stages, each offering a good level of variety, you will be doing everything from the regular run-and-gun DOOM action, to hopping in an Atlan - a giant humanoid war machine - or even riding a dragon into battle. Add a host of weapons, some returning, others new (including a flail, to stick to the medieval-style theme), and you have exciting demon-murdering gameplay, still joined by melee finishing moves to replenish your health and ammo. As a note, the traditional glory kills are gone unless it's a boss, which some may be disappointed with.</p>
<p>The actual run-and-gun gameplay feels more grounded than in DOOM Eternal, closer to that of DOOM (2016). This isn't to say there isn't any verticality, there is, but it no longer feels like it has delusions of being a secret-platformer. There likely isn't anything here that you won't find familiar if you've played the first game. Every weapon and ability has its use; each can be upgraded with the various currencies and items found throughout the game.</p>
<p>Much like the previous titles, the weapons are well placed within the game, meaning when you need one, it'll be introduced, with a quick tutorial. I recommend reading these because you may miss some of the bonuses weapons can bring. For example, one of the earliest ones can overcharge the energy shields of enemies, causing them to explode. Knowing the additional effects and upgrading the weapons to give them new abilities can be extremely useful in your quest to kill everything that breathes, has ever breathed, and will ever breathe.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Despite my praise of returning to a more horizontal gameplay, I have a few criticisms. Okay, one. I don't like the dragon and anything to do with it. It's cool, but when I'm flying a dragon, it should not be locked into a near horizontal plane once I'm locked onto an enemy. I'm flying a dragon with guns. I want to be able to swoop in and shoot, and I want to do strafing runs. It looks and comes across like it should be aerial combat, but the actual combat feels nothing like that.</p>
<p>This isn't to say it doesn't fit in with the world or narrative, but there is a disconnect between what it is and how it feels like it should be. Particularly when flying outside of combat, which is free-flowing. My thoughts on this don't extend to other things, such as the Atlan, which does fit in well with the rest of the game. It feels slower paced, as expected from a giant mech, but it doesn't feel like it should be something else. Granted, I can imagine some people being frustrated by the slower pace compared to the core gameplay.</p>
<p>Still, these are minor issues in the grand scheme. It's a long campaign packed with DOOM goodness, including finding secrets, codex entries, and more. Exploration is, as always, rewarded. It also does exceptionally well opening up the game on some levels, giving you a vast map to play in and tackle objectives in the way you want. Eschewing the linearity gives it a fresher feel at times, and it's also handy to turn back around and replenish some stocks if you've found that you're struggling in a fight.</p>
<p>It's all tied together with excellent visuals and audio. Now, this being a DOOM game, and it being 2025, that's like saying "the sun will rise in the morning". I still can't emphasise enough that the aesthetics and design of DOOM: The Dark Age are excellent, particularly when you start venturing away from Argent. Add the usual metal riff to this, and you've got a successful, pulse-pounding action and blood-filled game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So, to put it all quite simply, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a good game—no, it's a very good game. I would recommend it to fans of the genre and people who want to have fun without the risk of anything transmissible via bodily fluids. Unless we're talking about demon blood and guts, there's lots of that. DOOM: The Dark Ages is yet another success from Id Software, and long may they continue.</p>

					<h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Outstanding run &amp; gun DOOM gameplay.
</li><li>Fantastic visual design and audio.
</li><li>A good, long, meaty campaign.
</li><li>Great level design, with some huge scale battles at points.</li>						</ul>

The tastiest thing you can currently do in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haneda-girl">Haneda Girl</a> is eject yourself from your mech straight into a streaking katana blow that carries you though a door and two torsos before teleport-summoning your mech as though inflating a lifejacket to gun down three other mooks in a giddy gout of purple gore. OK, that’s more than one thing. It is, according to local experts, a combo. What are combos good for? Score multipliers, that’s what. Here is a trailer. Ware the techno.

In this action-platform stealth me-do from Studio Koba, you’re a juvenile coin-op junkie who has been piped Tron-style into an arcade game to “save Data Empire from the frightening (and intense) Hackernauts.” Each level is a tidy 2D breach-and-clear puzzlebox in which you can stomp around in your M.O.T.H.E.R mecha, or platform on foot like a sucker. While inside the mecha you have Gatling guns and shields, but you’re too hefty to fit through doors. While on foot, meanwhile, you can run up walls and backstab people, but you can also be slain in one hit. 
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Haneda Girl can teleport-summon the mecha without penalty, so there’s no need to commit to either style, save for when you’re constrained by an obstacle such as an inconsiderately human-sized passage or a katana-proof fractured surface. The Steam blurb has some helpful, slightly insulting advice: “I am fearful and conservative = use M.O.T.H.E.R”; “Some days I get the nerve = Swap between M.O.T.H.E.R and Haneda”; “I am very forward = Haneda Girl (no doubts)”. 
</p>
<p>
To put all that another way, you will “move like in Celeste”, “destroy like in Bro Force”, “slash like in Katana Zero”, and “die like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>”. Woah, save some touchstones for the rest of us, Studio Koba! There’s wearing your influences on your sleeve, and then there’s bulletpointing them as verbs. 
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, Haneda Girl has a few fresh ideas of its own. The dual character setup harbours a nifty symbiotic resourcing element. When Haneda Girl ejects from the cockpit, the mecha’s shields are restored; when she summons the mecha, it also replenishes her superdash attacks. So the more you switch, the more capable you’ll be, and the more you’ll feel like weaving the mech and pilot elements into a gratifying techno pretzel.</p>
<p>Given some appropriately devious level design, I think these fundamentals could really sing. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169790/Haneda_Girl/">a demo on Steam</a>. The full game releases on 23rd May.

<p dir="ltr">"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson said.</p><p dir="ltr">The images in question were billboards with text like "We Build Your Town" or "We Build Your Dreams" accompanied by odd images, like an under-construction skyscraper with strange pathways. Another image that had fans wondering was one of a car with unusually large windows and small tires, something that looked similar to what a generative AI might cook up.</p><p dir="ltr">Since Mario Kart World isn't yet out, it's possible what was shown in the gameplay livestream was simply placeholder or unfinished art. Regardless, Nintendo's statement seems fairly definitive, so fans worried about the use of AI art in the $80 game can rest easy (even if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">Nintendo has not done a great job justifying its price</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">With the game's June 5 release coming fast, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">everything we currently know about Mario Kart World</a>, ranging from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">number of playable characters</a> to all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">Mario Kart World's items</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-game-accessory-preorders-are-live/1100-6530753/" data-ref-id="1100-6530753">Mario Kart World and accessories are currently available for preorder</a>.

Some examples include tweaking "voiced dialogue" to "vocal material" to include monster/creature sounds or efforts and cover said performances, as well as pursuing clarity on how companies will keep track of performances to pay workers when they use them at a later date.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This includes the Secondary Performance Payment (SSP)—a one-time payment meant to help protect performance-capture acting performers from being fully displaced by generative AI. The union said it‛s willing to give on the amount of payment, allowing for an annual audit, making said payment optional rather than mandatory. It also rejected the 12-month limit on reporting about the use of an actor‛s performance "because games take much longer than 12 months," as per the response, and workers might need information that goes farther back than said period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employers originally wanted to provide AI protections solely to new performances under the interactive media agreement (IMA). In short, anything done previously, as well as performances taken from outside the IMA would be given no protections. Now, companies are willing to cover any work done under the IMA, no matter when it was recorded, as a digital replica.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ten-big-questions-and-answers-about-the-games-industry-in-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">[Omdia Webinar] Ten Big Questions and Answers About the Games Industry in 2025</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios are pursuing a model where they can use a performer's replica for a franchise they've worked on before (without special permission), but willing to pay minimum scale. SAG-AFTRA holds that companies should always have to let the worker know and get their explicit consent first.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some companies pay session by session for performers to record for pre-production, whereas many don't pay for this work or don't use performers at all," read the response to this specific clause. "Paying a single session fee for all scratch use on a project is a middle ground."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Replica use should require special considerations">Replica use should require special considerations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union also rejected unlimited digital replica use buyouts "without a strong, clear justification."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have repeatedly asked for why they can't pay by specific amount of use for performance they do typically track, meaning dialogue and visual performance for cinematics," SAG-AFTRA said. "No answer. Buyouts as a payment structure inherently benefit employers and make it harder for performers to make a sustainable living. This is evident wherever buyouts are introduced—more than a convenience, they are typically a purposeful discount to employers."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-expects-the-switch-2-to-sell-15-million-units-in-nine-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo expects the Switch 2 to sell 15 million units in nine months</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some further context from the union: Most performers work fewer than seven sessions or so on this contract. If the buyouts were mandatory, every single actor would get them, and many performers would make more than they normally do, while the performers (leads, certain utility and movement performers) who work 10, 40, 70 sessions per game would stand to make "MUCH, MUCH less," signifying an issue for those performers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, the buyouts are not mandatory, signifying "an issue for everyone" instead. If companies estimate that they need a worker‛s replica for fewer than six sessions' worth of material, or do not need the replica altogether, they won‛t offer a buyout. This changes if the replica is needed for more than six sessions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA also honed in on the specificity of requests for consent, demanding that companies should provide "both the number of lines/estimated days AND the negotiated payment in the usage report" handed to workers. "If they only report the payment and not how much material they made with your replica, you would never know how much value your payment represents," read the response.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-business-primed-for-accelerated-growth-following-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">EA says business primed for 'accelerated growth' following layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because games are often large, dynamic worlds with tens to hundreds of hours of gameplay, it will be very difficult to confirm how much or in what way [the] employer used your replica without a detailed usage report."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ongoing strike has received bipartisan congressional support, while some studios are recasting actors">The ongoing strike has received bipartisan congressional support, while some studios are recasting actors</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On April 10, SAG-AFTRA received </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-receives-congress-bipartisan-support-for-anti-deepfake-and-ai-act">bipartisan congressional support</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the union's Nurture Originals, Foster Art, and Keep Entertainment Safe (NO FAKES) act when it was reintroduced in the senate.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Nintendo</a> doesn't respond to every rumor and bit of speculation on the internet, but it has stepped up to push back against speculation that AI-generated images were used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Some viewers of Nintendo's last Treehouse presentation for the kart racer suspected that AI-generated images were used in Mario Kart World on the billboards that fill part of the background on the tracks. Specifically, they thought artwork of a bridge and one immediately next to it of a skyscraper being built were AI-generated. A third billboard featuring a car with exaggerated windows was also thought to be AI-generated.</p>

<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">Eurogamer</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson bluntly shut down the suspicions that AI-generated content was used in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"<em>AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World</em>," they said.</p>
<p>The images in question might look wonky to players now, but it's worth noting that Nintendo is likely updating and polishing details like these background billboards as much as possible, leading up to the release of the game and the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p>
<p>These billboards could have even been placeholders at the time of the Treehouse presentation that will be swapped with entirely different images for the game's launch, or simply not final versions of the artwork that will feature in the final release. Ultimately, at this stage in the game, we can't determine if these images were AI-generated. It'll be interesting to see if they make it into the final release, and if they remain the same, are updated and polished up, or are changed entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest explanation here could also be the truth, that these images simply aren't up to snuff, and that these background billboards perhaps aren't where Nintendo's artists have done their best work. People make mistakes all the time, and this could very well be as simple as that.</p>

Developer Silent Games’ <em>Empyreal</em> is among the newest attempts to capture the all-important thrill of challenging combat and dangerous exploration, casting players as a mercenary exploring a colossal Monolith on an unexplored planet. If you’re itching to check it out, you may be curious how much time you’ll need to complete it, though. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196742,196452" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h445403"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Empyreal</em>?</h2><p>As is common with Soulslike games, <em>Empyreal</em> offers a difficult expedition that requires careful positioning, intense strategy, and quick reflexes to overcome its many powerful foes. But with a bit of practice and patience, overcoming its trials is certainly doable—though how long that takes will largely depend on your skill level.</p><p><strong>An average playthrough of <em>Empyreal</em> will take around 15-20 hours</strong>, which includes exploring for secrets, completing NPC side-quests, and tackling the game’s punishing boss encounters. However, the first playthrough is just the beginning of your adventure through the Monolith.</p><p><strong>After beating <em>Empyreal</em> the first time, you can begin a New Game Plus run</strong> for some fresh experiences. These include an increased level cap for Cartograms, additional NPC duels, and even an epilogue to reward those who want to absorb the game’s full story. Running through the game this second time means you can essentially double your playtime in this Soulslike journey.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that <em>Empyreal</em> features asynchronous multiplayer, which allows you to share items and more to assist other players in their instance of the game. If you’re the type who lives by the “sharing is caring” mantra, this should give you a reason to stick around and make yourself useful. If not, maybe therapy would be a more rewarding way to spend your money than grabbing a copy of <em>Empyreal</em>, you big meanie.</p><hr><p><em>Empyreal</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Freddy Fazbear and his animatronic-filled pizza emporium headline Behviour’s plans for this year’s anniversary chapter, which is expected to arrive in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lillard, who starred as William Afton in 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy’s movie</a> adaptation, has embodied the spirit of the role once again to lend his likeness and record new voice lines for Dead by Daylight’s latest Killer: Springtrap. This evil animatronic bunny, otherwise known as Yellow Rabbit or Spring Bonnie, will be available as a Legendary Outfit when the collection eventually arrives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behaviour calls Five Nights at Freddy’s the “most requested license in Dead by Daylight history,” so fans should be excited to hear that the content drop will also include a Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza map that is said to be filled with a buffet of Easter Eggs and surprises to uncover. More news, including a specific release date, is expected to arrive in the near future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/dbd-fnaf-key-art-1746758440373.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/dbd-fnaf-map-exterior-screenshot-1746758445776.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Five Nights at Freddy's comes to Dead by Daylight. Image courtesy of Behaviour Interactive.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Wind’s Howling</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A Five Nights at Freddy’s Dead by Daylight crossover has been a long time coming, but it’s not the only gaming collaboration in the cards. Also revealed at PAX East was the news that CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher series is also set to make an appearance in Behviour’s hit horror experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set will make its mark as a special Witcher Collection June 3 and includes outfits inspired by the popular fantasy RPG universe. This includes a Legendary piece inspired by the White Wolf himself, Geralt of Rivia, as well as Very Rare outfits for Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. As an added bonus, those who pick up the Geralt costume will notice that original voice actor Doug Cockle contributed new voice lines just for this very occasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our favorite of the Collection is, of course, Geralt’s Legendary Outfit for Vittorio Toscano,” Dead by Daylight Product Director Rose Li said in a statement. “Not only will it let players essentially take on the exact look of The White Wolf, but we’ve also added some really nice details as part of this Outfit. Geralt will have unique lobby animations, and best of all, brand-new voice lines recorded for our game by the original voice actor, Doug Cockle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragula, Shudder’s monster-themed drag reality competition series, is also doubling down on its relationship with Dead by Daylight. Players can look forward to picking up a Boulet Brothers Collection come July 8, which includes a Winter Warrior outfit for The Huntress and the Boulet Brothers Artist outfit for The Artist.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher x Dead by Daylight Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Blood, Sweat, and Tears</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included in Behaviour’s PAX East showcase was the promise that the team will deliver fresh quality of life updates throughout 2025 and beyond. June highlights include a The Archives revamp and adjusted Gamma Settings, with the months ahead set to bring updates that add more spectators in Custom Matches, map and key item rebalancing, an MMR rework, and more balance tweaks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Director Dave Richard also teased something completely new: a Dead by Daylight Chapter entirely created by fans. It’s a move that will see Behaviour working with its community to create a Killer and Survivor from the ground up in what sounds like a choose-your-own-adventure-style narrative, meaning everything about each character will be voted on by the players. It’s due out in 2026, so we’ll have to wait a while to learn more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead by Daylight launched in 2016 and has only grown since. Other crossover Collections include content based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-by-daylight-official-dungeons-dragons-collection-trailer"><u>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-by-daylight-official-2v8-resident-evil-trailer"><u>Resident Evil</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-by-daylight-x-tokyo-ghoul-official-launch-trailer"><u>Tokyo Ghoul</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p><strong>Update</strong>: As of 11:15 AM PT / 2:15 PM ET, this issue appears to be resolved--and just in time for Mace Windu to hit the shop tonight.</p><p><strong>Original story</strong>: The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> item shop has ballooned in recent years. In 2018 or so, you might find a new character skin, or "outfit," in there a few times per week. These days, it's a megastore full of licensed music, muscle cars, virtual Lego playsets, Marvel heroes, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-in-the-fortnite-item-shop-today-november-2-2021-el-chapulin-colorado-arrives/1100-6497610/" data-ref-id="1100-6497610">the protagonist of a 1970s Mexican superhero sitcom</a>, for reasons that still elude me to this day. But today the shop looks very different: It's almost entirely empty.</p><p>As you might expect, this isn't intentional, and Epic has said it's working on a fix, but it's rather jarring to see the shop so devoid of in-game purchases, given how many tabs of colorful digital toys it's usually lined with these days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1920888048914514198" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're investigating an issue where the in-game Shop and Web Item Shop may appear empty.<br>We'll provide an update once this is resolved. <a href="https://t.co/cLlcJrdEB2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/cLlcJrdEB2</a></p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1920888048914514198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The only things for sale currently are the few items purchased with local currency rather than V-Bucks, as well as the level skips for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-star-wars-battle-pass-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-6523/" data-ref-id="2900-6523">Fortnite Star Wars battle pass</a>. This includes things like a Fortnite Crew subscription, and "starter packs" that tend to include a few bundled items for cheap. Everything else has vanished like your total crowns on a season launch day.</p><p>It's unclear what has caused this error, but it may be related to Epic's continued woes surrounding the item shop. Since its user experience overhaul, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-item-shop-wont-stop-being-weird/1100-6520635/" data-ref-id="1100-6520635">the Fortnite virtual store has routinely expressed some confusing, often slightly comical, problems</a>. Then again, perhaps today's issue comes as the result of some advantageous changes to the Epic Games Store, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-makes-buying-v-bucks-a-lot-more-rewarding/1100-6531431/" data-ref-id="1100-6531431">which will now see players getting back 20% of their money spent V-Bucks purchases through Epic directly</a>, as the company gears up to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">Fortnite back on iOS</a> around the globe.</p><p>Whatever the cause of today's slip-up, it's likely to be resolved soon, so don't fret; the TikTok dances, anthropomorphic fruit, and Rocket League imports will return.</p>

<p>"Rest assured, Guardians, everything in Renegades is in-canon for the Destiny universe," he said. "But we're leaning into the aesthetic, tone and vibe of Star Wars to tell a Destiny story with Destiny characters."</p><p>Two other changes incoming are how Power levels work and Vault space expanding as well. During the stream, Bungie showed some items with a 10 power and confused some players. Not a lot of detail was shared, but the company confirmed that players will have their Power level changed at the start of the Year of Prophecy.</p><p>"We'll have more details on Power caps and climbs in a future TWID, but can confirm that Power will be rebased at launch! All players will have their Power refreshed as we embark on this new journey."</p><p>As for your items being limited to your Vault space, that won't be changing in The Edge of Fate, but players will have additional Vault space and even "quality of life" features planned for Renegades later this year. </p><p>Another one of the biggest core game changes coming to Destiny 2 will be the Portal, a new activity selection screen built to accommodate different playstyles to make it easier on where players want to go next. For years, players have relied on the Director for their activity browsing. However, over the years, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-may-have-fixed-destiny-2s-most-frustrating-problem/1100-6531356/" data-ref-id="1100-6531356">become muddled and a bit confusing</a>. What's proposed with Portal (name pending) is to clean up the screen to make it easier to get to the current expansion or event content. The Director will still be around and will be under the Worlds tab in the Portal.</p><p>The Edge of Fate preorders are now available on all supported platforms, and there are <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy/yearofprophecy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three different versions</a>. Additionally, the Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy Collector's Edition is also available for preorder on the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy/YearOfProphecy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Store</a>.</p>

			<p>Alkimia Interactive has announced that an updated version of the Gothic Remake demo is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The demo wasn't very well-received when it first became available during February's Steam Next Fest, but the developers have improved it based on the community's feedback. For example, Alkimia was originally inspired by the slow movement of a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, but players communicated that they'd prefer something more reactive.</p>
<p><em>We see a lot of things we didn't have so much on the radar, for example, like the movement in the game. Our main reference really was Red Dead Redemption 2, which is a game that has a very slow pacing in terms of movement. The clear feedback, though, was people like it more reactive, and that certain actions that are repeated over and over again should be rather quick, which means not realistic.</em></p>
<p><em>In the Demo specifically, there were certain elements that were not working out. The Demo is just what it is. It's not representative of the full Gothic Remake game. The Demo is locked at a certain time of day, so you obviously have just no visual variety. There’s no weather in there — it’s always sunny, right? You see one specific weather and daylight condition all the time. It's not doing justice to the full game.</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody has to realize also that, of course, the Gothic Remake demo has daily routines, but they are nowhere near as detailed as in the original. And of course it has some monsters, but like, of course you won't see how monsters beyond that react. You only see very few characters, and you don't see them in a camp, where they are actually living, where they have a real daily routine.</em></p>
<p><em>They are kind of like all in an extreme situation because they are trapped. You should get an idea of what can happen with progression, but it was maybe a little too fast. So players might get the wrong idea of like, oh, in the Gothic Remake you will actually progress faster than you will do. But no, the pacing is still very much the same, the power curve.</em></p>
<p><em>And then another big problem of the combat in the demo was the hit sounds. There were just clear bugs in there. Sometimes, you would think you'd land a hit with the sword, because the models touch each other, but it wouldn't recognize the hit, so it gives you this awkward feeling of like, oh, the combat system is bad.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's a glitch, it's a bug. It's something we'll address and fix. We're&nbsp;not saying like, hey, all is good, right? There's a lot of stuff we need to improve, much, much further and continue to work on until the very end.</em></p>

            <p>
Sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> is the first game from Reburn, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">a new incarnation of Metro co-developers 4A Games Ukraine</a>. It's out now in early access. That last bit is a surprise: the developers had planned to release the new shooter as "a large, complete journey", but had to make "certain pivots" in the face of resource constraints, technical complications and, presumably, the broad impacts of living in a warzone. This led to a launch delay last week and then, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2282350/view/512957012199342081?l=english">the abrupt announcement</a> that La Quimera would start out as an early access project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I've played the first of the early access build's four missions, and yeah, it all feels a bit undercooked, though I feel like the problem is less execution than concept. La Quimera simply doesn't feel like a very enthralling shooter, next to the developer's previous post-apocalyptic Moscow tunnel escapades.</p>
<p>It's set in a futuristic travesty of Latin America that is sort of Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare trying to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> by way of Horizon: Zero Dawn, with neo-Aztec megacities and verdant metal ruins full of feral bots. You play a PMC trooper who embarks on a straightforward rescue mission and is promptly swept up in wider technofeudal shenanigans, which usefully lead to you becoming a guinea pig for some cybernetic implants. 
</p>

<p>
Said early-game Stroggification brings with it a suite of secondary abilities and upgrades, which I've yet to acquire. They'll need to be exciting indeed, because La Quimera's gunplay is currently rather plodding for what is theoretically more of a power fantasy than Metro. In brief: you hide behind things and pick 'em off one by one till somebody flanks or lobs a grenade - rinse and repeat. There are two broad categories of gun: red types are for dudes, blue types are for drones. The weapons are tricked out and greebled to the max - one of the starting pistols looks like a ghost-busting hairdryer - but they don't (yet) have the storied intimacy of Metro's hydraulic BB guns and drum-fed shotties. They're just flashy gizmos. 
</p>
<p>
You can say similar things of the story and world. The setting is touristy bordering on demeaning - this is one of those localisations where people tactically pepper the English with bits of high-velocity Spanish, as though the other language existed to supply punchlines. The dialogue is also sweary in a way that is <em>almost</em> overcompensatory enough to be charming, like you're witnessing kids utter their very first F-bombs, but mostly just insipid. Still, a lot of thought appears to have gone into the dense and gleaming or gutted and overgrown architecture and geography. It's just a shame La Quimera won't let you explore too far: this appears to be a universe of tunnels and tiered chambers, like Metro, except that being set in the open air, it needs holographic red mission boundaries to stop you wandering off. 
</p>

<p>
It doesn't feel like a particularly tough game on Normal difficulty. Health must be replenished manually, but the game restores a little out of mercy when you're nearly dead, and there are regular checkpoints to soften the fall when you exhaust your capped supply of medikits. You also have the option of co-op, with players forming up in your hub base before embarking on missions.
</p>
<p>
La Quimera will remain in early access for "up to 18 months". Here's what you'll hopefully get in the full release:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes.
</p>
<p>
- Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations.
</p>
<p>
- Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters.
</p>
<p>
- Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players.
</p>
<p>
- A larger number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I would definitely reserve your pennies for the moment. I can sort of see a serviceable shooter arising from this one's whirl of doodads, bandidos and cussing. Perhaps the later plot developments and fancier upgrades will save it from disaster. Still, if you're after a campaign shooter right now, you're probably better off digging out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> again.

                <p>With Fortnite and other Epic mobile titles finally returning to iOS soon after five years, Epic Games is marking the occasion by introducing a major bonus for those who spend money on its games: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/better-deals-in-fortnite-and-more-players-get-20-back-in-epic-rewards-starting-today" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20% back in rewards cash</a> on all purchases in Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys made using Epic's own payment system in the Epic Games Store, a massive boost from the 5% it normally offers. Even better is that this change is permanent, and is already live.</p><p>But that's not all--that 20% cash back will apply to <em>all</em> purchases made through EGS until the end of August. If that percentage seems extraordinarily high, that's because it is. Under these terms, buying a new $70 game will net $14 in credit that you can use on anything in the Epic Games Store aside from subscriptions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243" data-ratio="0.56239217941346" data-width="1739" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243"></a><figcaption>The new option that will be presented to Fortnite players when they purchase V-Bucks on iPhone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Epic's motivation for this move is to encourage players to spend money with them directly rather than going through, say, Apple's App Store, which takes its own healthy percentage from every purchase made. For Fortnite specifically, Apple would take 30% off every purchase of V-Bucks--offering 20% back in rewards, by contrast, gives Epic the full purchase amount aside from normal transaction fees, and since the rewards cash can only be spent on the Epic Games Store it hypothetically keeps players invested in the company's ecosystem.</p><p>When players on iOS attempt to purchase V-Bucks now, they're given the option of doing so through the App Store or by using Epic's own payment systems, with the Epic option showing how much you'd earn in rewards. The Epic Rewards credit is applied to your account two weeks after the relevant purchase has been made, and once you've got it you can spend it on anything other than subscriptions. Meaning you can earn this 20% cash back by subscribing to Fortnite Crew, but you cannot use the store credit to pay for a Crew subscription.</p><p>This option is only for people who use Fortnite on PC, mobile or streaming--folks on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch will not have the option to pay Epic directly when they buy V-Bucks on those platforms. But console players can still use the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite web shop</a> and earn the 20% cash back that way.</p><p>It's a convenient moment for this change for a lot of Fortnite fans, as Mace Windu will be arriving in the Fortnite item shop this evening--the first new Star Wars item shop skin released during the current Star Wars season.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 | Animated Collaboration Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The crossover will begin on May 20 with a total of eight character skins, significantly more than recent collabs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2s-gundam-wing-collab-was-informed-by-gunpla/1100-6531147/" data-ref-id="1100-6531147">Gundam Wing</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-debuts-avatar-collaboration-costumes-and-a-free-skin/1100-6528431/" data-ref-id="1100-6528431">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>. Below is the full list of Overwatch characters who will be getting the Street Fighter treatment.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kirkio as Juri</li><li dir="ltr">Widowmaker as Cammy</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M. Bison</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Each skin can be briefly glimpsed in the animated trailer and looks to capture the spirit of Capcom's fighting game perfectly. Sigma as M. Bison and Zenyatta as Dhalsim are no-brainers, and Hanzo being Japanese is a great fit for Ryu.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not released exact details on pricing or what freebies players will be able to score as part of the event, but the end of the trailer does show Hanzo performing a Hadoken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku. That may mean each collab skin will come bundled with a few of each Street Fighter character's signature moves in the form of emotes, but fans will have to wait a little longer for more information.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-16-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-6495/" data-ref-id="2900-6495">Overwatch 2 recently saw the start of Season 16</a>, which introduced a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">damage hero, Freya</a>, and added the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/" data-ref-id="1100-6531214">third-person Stadium mode</a>. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 will receive a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/street-fighter-6-elena-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6465935/" data-ref-id="2300-6465935">playable fighter, Elena</a>, on June 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/09/toby-fox-is-releasing-deltarune-chapters-1-4-slightly-earlier-than-expected<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After years of waiting for news, we learned last month that Deltarune Chapters 1-4 would not only be coming out on June 5 but that it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">would be a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title</a>. However, in a newsletter sent out last night, developer/composer Toby Fox explained that the game itself will launch a little earlier than the console, depending on where you live.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for purchase in Japan starting at midnight on June 5, and since Deltarune will be a launch title, the game will also go live digitally at that time. However, Deltarune is not a console exclusive – it's also launching on PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC – so tying its international release to the staggered launch of just one of its platforms doesn't make sense. Instead, the game will go live worldwide at midnight JST.</p><p>Since Japan's time zone is ahead of most of the world, Deltarune will launch on June 4 in most areas. In the US, that becomes 8 AM Pacific and 11 AM Eastern, while Europe can expect to play the game in the early evening, and Asia can expect it later that night. The exceptions to this are parts of Australia, New Zealand, and other territories east of Japan. Because their midnight will come even earlier than Japan's, meaning the Switch 2 launch happens earliest there, they'll get access to Deltarune a few hours before the rest of the world's simultaneous release.</p>

<p>On the subject of Australia and New Zealand, Fox's newsletter urges them not to spoil the game. "But, for convenience's sake, we're just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out…" the newsletter says. "Meanwhile, don't say anything about it please."</p><p>The newsletter also announced cross-generation purchasing, which applies if you buy the game on a Nintendo or PlayStation platform. For example, if you buy a PlayStation 4 version of the game, you also get a PlayStation 5 version, which is pretty standard on the platform. However, the same will go for Nintendo: if you buy the game on the Switch, you can get the Switch 2 version at no additional cost. Whether you're unsure what time your Switch 2 will arrive on launch day or you didn't get one yet, you can buy the Switch 1 version and have the upgrade ready when you get the new platform. A prior newsletter also confirmed that you can transfer save data between the two versions.</p><p>Deltarune is Toby Fox's follow-up to Undertale, one of the most successful indie games of all time. If you're interested in playing the first two chapters, they're available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC for free. The complete game, which will include four chapters and free updates for any subsequent chapters, will be $24.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After stating its studio would be based in Bellevue, Washington, the statement explains that the "LFG" in the studio's name stands for "looking for group," a common internet acronym for people searching for people to play games with.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>TeamLFG's first game will include a wide range of inspirations, including one odd one. The statement reads, "Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games." Not only does this list not include shooters, the genre Bungie is best known for, but it also includes "frog-type games," a genre none of the staff at Game Informer is familiar with. If the studio's goal was to pique our curiosity, it succeeded.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sega has been making a concerted push into the multimedia space in recent years. The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>theatrical&nbsp;trilogy has led the charge since 2020, but just last year, we also received the Amazon MGM Studios-produced streaming series&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>on Prime Video. On top of that, Sega has announced adaptations based on Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and other franchises in the future. The company isn't stopping there, however, as a new report attaches actress Sydney Sweeney and director Michael Bay to an upcoming adaptation of the arcade driving series OutRun.</p>

<p>This report, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">comes from <em>Deadline</em></a>, attaches Sweeney as producer, Bay as director, and Jayson Rothwell as scriptwriter. Additionally, Sega senior executive officer Toru Nakahara will produce from Sega's side, while Sega President and Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi will oversee the project. Nakahara has produced every project in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>film series, including the Paramount Plus&nbsp;<em>Knuckles</em>&nbsp;show. He is also lined up to produce the Streets of Rage movie. Utsumi has served as executive producer on <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Knuckles,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.</p>

<p>Sweeney is best known for her roles in shows like&nbsp;<em>Euphoria</em>, <em>White Lotus</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, as well as films like&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.&nbsp;</em>Though best known for her onscreen work, according to <em>Deadline</em>'s report, Sweeney is only attached as a producer at this point. Bay is known as a longtime director of action films, including&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys, Armageddon</em>, five&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>&nbsp;films, and&nbsp;<em>Pearl Harbor</em>. Rothwell wrote for&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arachnid</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The film is being developed by Universal Pictures, though plot details are scarce at the moment, according to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>. You may note that Universal Pictures is also the studio behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which is the studio's third highest-grossing film of all time, behind only&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Furious 7.&nbsp;</em>While OutRun hardly has the name recognition of Super Mario Bros., it stands to reason that Universal would want to return to the video-game-adaptation well that brought them success with both <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i>&nbsp;and <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Dune: Awakening's previously announced large-scale beta weekend is now live for players to jump in and try Dune: Awakening themselves, as Funcom continues to test its servers leading up to its new June 10, 2025, launch date.</p>
<p>Originally, Dune: Awakening was set to arrive in a little more than a week from the time of writing, on May 20. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/">At the ides of April</a>, Funcom announced that it had pushed the release date back three weeks, saying that the team needed "<em>a bit more time to cook</em>" in order to implement some changes and fixes it wanted to make based on feedback the team had received from players already in the closed beta.</p>
<p>Funcom has been beta testing Dune: Awakening for months now, with those lucky enough to get a beta invite being part of Funcom increasingly pushing the limit of its servers. But even with all the testing in the world, fans of the genre know that the biggest MMO's can still suffer from gameplay issues due to overcrowded servers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, ahead of the beta test kicking off, Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/server-structure-and-large-scale-multiplayer-mechanics-explained">directly addressed</a> those concerns, telling players that "<em>this is not our first rodeo</em>," and that the team has expects, and has been preparing, for the "<em>heavy loads</em>" of players that'll hit its servers at launch.</p>
<p>The beta weekend will run from today, May 9, to Monday, May 12, and if you've yet to receive a beta invite from Funcom, you can still register for this weekend's beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam page</a>. Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/large-scale-beta-weekend-all-you-need-to-know">adds</a> that if you wishlist the game and sign up to receive emails from the team about Dune: Awakening, that can increase your chances of getting a code. There will also be a Twitch broadcast hosted on May 10, 2025, from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom">Funcom's official channel</a>, where you'll have a chance to grab one of the "<em>tens of </em><em>thousands</em>" of codes that will be made available to those who tune in.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play up to the first 25 hours of Dune: Awakening in this weekend's beta, if you decide to do nothing else but play it the whole weekend, which Funcom says is most of Act 1. A key difference for this beta is that there's no NDA required to join. After playing as much as you like this weekend, you'll be able to talk about what you played and what you think. You'll also be able to stream the game, if you like, while playing.</p>
<p>If you want to find out a little more about what you'll play in this weekend's beta, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/">already spent a chunk of time with Dune: Awakening</a> playing the same content in this weekend's beta. Check out his thoughts on it in the preview.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I finally got to play the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-c-button-animal-crossing-zelda-friend-codes-1851775334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-c-button-animal-crossing-zelda-friend-codes-1851775334">Switch 2</a></span>. It happened as part of a demo here at PAX East, and though my time with the system was brief (and I wasn’t even allowed to look at the console itself as it was hidden beneath a demo station), it did give me a chance to play around with one of the features I was most curious about: the mouse controls. I don’t typically play games on my PC, and when I do, I don’t often use my mouse if I can help it. However, I’m always interested in control methods that can bridge the gap between styles of play we typically associate with other platforms. PlayStation’s touch pads have given console players a trackpad equivalent, for instance, so naturally, someone needed to build a proper mouse into a console controller at some point. I found a surprisingly convincing tech demo for the Switch 2’s mouse controls in <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em>. The specific playing experience I had wasn’t ideal, but it did sell me on the tech.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,195410,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The reason I had a less-than-optimal experience with the Switch 2 Joy-Cons was just bad circumstances. Square Enix’s demo space had us set up at a coffee table that I had to lean over to use the mouse controls. My wrists were already slightly twisted in an uncomfortable position just to hold the controllers properly, so having to adjust further to reach the low-sitting table wasn’t conducive to a great first impression. However, I quickly realized that if I could put the Joy-Cons at about the level I would normally use a mouse, a lot of that discomfort would go away. Nintendo has been adamant that the Switch 2 Joy-Cons work as a mouse even if you’re using them on your pants, and while that’s cool and novel, it really doesn’t feel like a good setup for extended play.</p><p>I use my Switch in tabletop mode fairly often, and I could see the mouse controls becoming a standard control scheme for me when I have my Switch 2 propped up on my desk. Then, I can have my wrists more comfortably resting on a surface, rather than contorting them to reach a coffee table. I thankfully didn’t have much issue holding the controllers in the sideways position to use them as mice, but I can imagine that if you’re someone with bigger hands or a tighter grip, doing so might add to the wrist fatigue. The Joy-Con 2s are a bit bulkier than the toy-like controllers you’ll find on the original Switch, but your mileage may vary.</p><p><br>Once I got past the suboptimal setup, the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls were surprisingly very intuitive in <em>Bravely Default</em>’s new Switch 2-specific mini-games. Square is bringing over the full turn-based RPG to the console, but it’s also including new extracurricular activities that take advantage of the console/handheld hybrid’s tech. I was able to play two different games at the event, including a rhythm game that had me dragging the Joy-Con 2s across the table in accordance with visual prompts, such as moving a connected line to strike through visual clutter on the screen and bringing both cursors together to line up with beats in time with the music. That was neat, but the real test of the mouse controls was a ship mini-game that had me using the mouse controls to man the party’s airship from a first-person perspective in the cockpit. Compared to the rhythm game, it was surprisingly involved. It’s partially a flight sim, with you using the mouse controls to steer the vessel through rings as you make your way through the air, and then you also control its artillery in ship combat. The mouse controls are responsive, and the game doesn’t throw too much at you at once, so it’s a neat little tech demo that got me curious to see if more third-party devs will make use of the mouse controls.</p><p>The Switch 2 isn’t even out yet, so we have very little concept yet of how developers will use the feature. We can speculate that some games that have historically been tough sells on a controller, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008"><em>Civilization</em></a></span>, will be a more natural fit on the Switch 2 than a PlayStation or Xbox (my mind immediately went to the idea of mouse controls for a hypothetical <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span> port), but after playing a bit of <em>Bravely Default</em>’s new mini-games, I’m more interested in whether or not developers will make games and experiences tailored specifically to dual mouse controls than I am in ports. I’ll need to make sure I set the device up on a more comfortable spot than a coffee table, but I’m sold on the tech. The Switch 2 and <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em> both launch on June 5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-review.1185486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing that’s kept the name Doom up near the top of the list of first-person shooters, it’s how it’s always boldly reinventing being a badass, super powered, one-man army against the armies of Hell. Three decades ago we got the original old-school run-and-guns, then a jumpscare-laden horror shooter, then a modern reimagining of the old-school run-and-gun, and a mobility-focused action shooter in 2020’s Doom Eternal. The form that Doom: The Dark Ages takes on is actually one that is <em>very </em>different from Eternal, a game that I rank as one of my favorite shooters of all time. In fact, it’s so different that initially I was turned off by the heavier feel of the movement, the lack of a double jump or airdash, and the sheer chaos of having wide-open fields with seemingly hundreds of enemies closing in on me from all sides. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But a few hours into the 20+ hour campaign, my arsenal had expanded, the ways in which I could dispatch enemies had diversified, and I’d started to better understand and appreciate what Doom: The Dark Ages was and what it wasn’t. By the end of it I was left grinning like a Doomguy that just picked up a Super Shotgun as I ripped and tore until it was done</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages’s campaign is all about setting up the dark sci-fi fantasy vibes. It follows our strong, (mostly) silent Doom Slayer before he was awoken in a Sarcophagus in a UAC space station back in Doom 2016. Of course, the Slayer himself isn’t much more than just a vehicle for badassery, so it’s not like we’re seeing a new side of him or getting any sort of deeper look at his character’s origins or motivations. Instead, The Dark Ages’ story is more about filling in the blanks in the Doom universe, diving into the history of the conflict between humans and demons, and further fleshing out both the faction of humanity defending Sentinels and the deity-like Maykrs. And in that way, it’s not only serviceable, but it also does a good job of at least taking us to both a wide variety of hellish landscapes that includes sci-fi themed medieval castles, and a very welcome trip to the Lovecraftian-inspired Cosmic Realm, which features a ton of really cool mind bending puzzles and creepy settings that are different from what we’ve seen before. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is the strongest a Doom story has ever been.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the best thing about the story is that it no longer feels like it's just the Slayer against the nameless forces of Hell. There are human companions that are central to the plot: it regularly feels like you’re fighting alongside humanity in this giant all-out war against the demons, and there’s actual intrigue involving the mysterious Maykrs and their role in this whole conflict. This is the strongest a Doom story has ever been, even if that’s not a bar you’d have to double-jump over. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Captain Doom Slayer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides the setting, the big thing that separates Doom: The Dark Ages from prior entries in the series is the addition of the Slayer’s Shield, and all of the abilities that come with it. Now, rather than being forced to avoid taking damage by constantly staying on the move and jumping around like a madman, you’re often encouraged to charge straight forward into danger with your shield at the ready to either block or deflect enemy attacks. Any attack that is red can be blocked until your shield’s depleted, and anything that’s green can be reflected with a well-timed guard to not only deal substantial damage, but also stun most monsters it hits. Even on Nightmare difficulty, which is what I did my playthrough on, the parry timing is <em>very </em>generous, but fortunately you can fine tune it however you like in the menus, along with a ton of other handy difficulty modifiers. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other key shield technique is a charging bash attack that can be used to quickly close the distance between you and the enemy. Think the Super Shotgun’s grapple in Doom Eternal, only faster, you can use it with any weapon, and it’s on a relatively quick cooldown. This combination of being able to use the shield both defensively to block and stun, and then offensively to quickly zip in or out, is what really elevates The Dark Ages’ combat to the stratosphere by making it still feel very fast and exciting even with the removal of things like double jumps, quick dashes, and fast weapon swaps. We get the best of both worlds, in that this Slayer is still extremely mobile, but also feels like a heavily armored tank thanks to loud footsteps and a shockwave when you land from a high jump.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Slayer is still very mobile, but also feels like a heavily armored tank.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The shield’s utility doesn’t end there, either. Eventually, you’ll also get the ability to toss the shield out, Captain America style, to instantly decapitate tons of fodder enemies at once. Or, if you use it against larger enemies, it will continuously buzzsaw into them, keeping them incapacitated for a short while. This is an extremely useful skill, but I found this to be especially potent against the Arachnotron enemies that like to pepper me with a constant stream of non-refelctable bullets. If they’re unarmored, I can just toss my shield to stop them from shooting, dash in, and all it takes is a single super shotgun blast to ready them for an execution. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those abilities are key to surviving tough fights because almost every enemy in Doom: The Dark Ages has some sort of weakness like this – and unlike Doom Eternal, they are rarely weapon-specific. There’s no more switching to the combat shotgun specifically to pop a grenade into a Cacodemon’s mouth, then swapping to the rifle to snipe the guns off a Revenant, then swapping between shots of your super shotgun and ballistae to quickly burst down a Marauder or other big and beefy enemy, etc. That’s fun in its own way, and I'm sure there will be those out there like myself who will still prefer it overall, but The Dark Ages still manages to find a way to be an absolute blast without requiring a StarCraft pro’s level of APM (Actions Per Minute) on the harder difficulties. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemies are largely the usual suspects that have been in most of the other Dooms, You’ve got your Imps, Hell Knights, the aforementioned Mancubi and Arachnotron, and even the Cyberdemon, all of whom behave as you’d expect. Others have gotten new facelifts to better match with the new setting, like the Pinkie who’s now a mount with a demon archer riding him, and the new Cacodemon that hails from the Cosmic Realm. The Dark Ages even brings back the Vagary as a mini-boss, who hasn’t been seen since Doom 3. Overall, there’s a nice variety in the enemies, and even those you’ve fought a million times before have a few new tricks to make them fit better in The Dark Ages’ combat. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Id has exponentially jacked up the number of on-screen nasties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of enemies, It’s worth mentioning as well that Id has <em>exponentially </em>jacked up the number of on-screen nasties relative to Doom or Eternal. When you get a bird’s-eye view of a battlefield, it truly looks like all-out war against the minions of Hell. This did lead to a bit of frustration for me early on because I was often getting attacked from behind by enemies that would spawn in without warning, but all it took was some adjustment in how I approached certain combat encounters. I had to make sure that I used my shield bash to disengage in addition to engaging to keep them off my back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One noteworthy omission from The Dark Ages is the iconic Chainsaw that has been used since Doom 2016 as a way to instantly kill a single enemy and regain ammo in the process. That has been replaced by an all new melee system that lets you get up close and personal and engage in melee brawls that also restore your ammo. I do miss the satisfaction of just sawing an Imp or other small enemy in half, but this system works better for what Doom the Dark Ages is trying to achieve by again making you rush towards the fight rather than away from it. The “ammo” pick ups for your melee attack are also much more plentiful than the gas for the Chainsaw was in either Doom 2016 or Eternal, making me run out of ammo far less, which was something I very much appreciated.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Tools of Doom</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the actual weapons go, The Dark Ages plays around a lot with the look of each weapon to give it an old-timey flavor, but the functions are generally all the same as what we’ve come to know and love from this series. All the satisfyingly punchy stalwarts are accounted for: The combat and super shotguns, an assault rifle that shoots out railspikes instead of bullets (but don’t call it a railgun), a plasma rifle, and a single-shot sniper rifle-like weapon in the form of a satisfying steel ball launcher, just to name a handful. The only unique weapon of the bunch is the Skullcrusher Pulverizer, which sort of behaves like the chaingun but has a ridiculous spread that can just absolutely shred a football field’s worth of fodder enemies. It’s a fun weapon that goes great with The Dark Age’s absolutely insane amount of on-screen enemies at once, even though I typically opted to use the shield throw to mow down the hordes of fodder since there’s an upgrade that powers up the shield charge when you do so. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One interesting twist for how The Dark Ages handles its arsenal is that every gun has a sister weapon that uses the same ammo type and can be hotswapped between with the press of a button. So for example, along with a rocket launcher, there’s a grenade launcher; in addition to the aforementioned Pulverizer that does a little bit of damage spread out over a wide area, there’s a Ravager that concentrates the fire to hit single enemies. It all adds up to a ton of variety in the gunplay, and while I was never forced to swap between my weapons in the same way that I was in Doom Eternal, I still found myself jumping around from gun to gun simply because it’s fun.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I still found myself jumping around from gun to gun simply because it's fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the absolute best part about the toolbox in The Dark Ages is – and this is a credit to the weapon designers at Id, because this is true for just about every Doom game – that every gun retains its usefulness throughout the entire game. Sure, I might have my favorites and gravitate more towards the Super Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and Steelshot, but even the early weapons stay relevant once you get some upgrades into them. If I’m low on armor, I can swap to the combat shotgun that I upgraded to ignite enemies and make them drop armor shards; if I need health, I can swap to the Ravager to make them bleed h ealth pickups; and if I need to incapacitate an enemy while also dealing damage to others nearby I can throw my shield into a baddie, shoot the shield, and watch as my bullets ricochet and hit everyone else around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To sweeten the pot, all of these abilities and weapons are sprinkled at a measured pace throughout the campaign. There was never even a chance for the gunplay to get stale because every level would give me a new gun, or a new ability for my shield, or a new melee weapon, or I’d find enough gold to afford a new upgrade at the shop that would alter something I already had in a way that made me want to use it more.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Shooters</h3><p>Not in any sort of order</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s this need to upgrade that fed into my desire to explore and find both upgrade currencies and more traditional Doom collectibles like figurines, weapon skins, and lore pick ups. Appropriately, the levels of The Dark Ages welcome that exploration with open arms. While they all vary in size, the smaller stages are still big by the series standards, and the big levels are <em>gigantic. </em>They’re huge, open battlefields with tons of secrets, challenging enemy encounters, and more than a few breathtaking vistas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Doomazord Power </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Breaking up all of the running and gunning are giant mecha battles and flying sections where you pilot the Slayer’s dragon. Yes, the Doom Slayer has a dragon, because why not. These sections are shallow compared to the rest of The Dark Ages, with the mecha sections amounting to little more than a simple game of dodge, punch, punch, dodge, punch, punch, etc. And the dragon bits are little more than dodge, shoot, shoot, dodge, shoot, shoot. That said, they’re kind of like a turret sequence in that they’re infrequent and brief enough to never drag the pacing down, and they at least provide some cool moments in the cutscenes that precede and follow them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the soundtrack: holy hell. If you’ve played a Doom game before you probably know what to expect going in, but even so I was gleefully into it. It’s another banger of a heavy metal soundtrack that had me coming back to certain levels after beating the campaign and just turning down all the volume except for the music so I could listen without it being overpowered by all the sounds of shotgun blasts, explosions, and dying demons. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
