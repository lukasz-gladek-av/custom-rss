            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is almost an indictment of consumerism and capitalism. It’s bursting at the seams with shady, titanic corporations that almost always had some kind of dubious or deceptive subplot tucked behind the scenes in the run-up to the nuclear war that wiped the United States off the map. </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the most iconic brands from Fallout, determining which of the many organisations and corporations in the Fallout Universe stand out amongst the crowd.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-recognisable-fallout-brands">Most Recognisable Fallout Brands</h2>



<p>There are quite literally hundreds of brands, labels, organisations, and corporations in Fallout, but which of them can be counted as the most iconic? Here’s our definitive list to settle that debate and give you a little more visibility of the most iconic brands from Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-nuka-cola">1. Nuka-Cola</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-Cola is, without a doubt, the most recognisable and iconic brand in Fallout. It’s probably even more recognisable than Vault-Tec, which we’ll get to in a second. </p>



<p>In the Fallout Universe, Nuka-Cola is one of the biggest corporations, and its influence is felt far and wide across the post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the many millions of bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles that became the de facto currency after the bombs fell, after all.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-vault-tec-industries">2. Vault-Tec Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vault-Tec Industries was responsible for the construction of the vaults that housed many thousands of people as the bombs rained down across the United States in the Fallout Universe. </p>



<p>It’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – its mascot alone, the blond-haired Vault Boy, is one of the most recognisable characters in modern gaming. It might have been a relatively evil, disingenuous corporation, but that’s the point.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-super-duper-mart">3. Super-Duper Mart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super-Duper Mart is Fallout’s representation of Wal-Mart, and it’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout. It’s primarily an ‘East Coast’ organisation, so it has only been present in Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, but that’s enough for the brand to have left a lasting impression on players. </p>



<p>One of the earliest missions in Fallout 3 takes players into the heart of a Super-Duper Mart overrun by Raiders, and that’s a hugely memorable portion of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-west-tek">4. West-Tek</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>West-Tek is one of those Fallout brands that didn’t gain mass prominence until Fallout 76, when players got the opportunity to visit buildings that once housed this titanic technological corporation. </p>



<p>It might not be common knowledge, but West-Tek is one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – it’s the firm responsible for the creation of Power Armor, laser-based weapons, and some of the research into the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus).</p>







<h3 id="h-5-general-atomics-international">5. General Atomics International</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>General Atomics International is responsible for a series of robots that are commonplace across the Fallout Universe. Before the Great War, General Atomics International created the Mister Handy, arguably one of the most recognisable robots from the Fallout series – everyone who has played the games has seen one. It also produced Mister Gutsy, Robobrain, and co-created Liberty Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-robco-industries">6. RobCo Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We couldn’t list Generic Atomics International and not mention RobCo Industries! This iconic Fallout brand was founded by none other than Robert Edwin House — that’s right, <strong>the </strong>Mr. House from Fallout: New Vegas. </p>



<p>As Fallout’s answer to Tony Stark, Mr. House’s corporation was responsible for the creation of a huge array of robots: Eyebot, Protectron, Sentry Bot, Securitron, Liberty Prime, and Assaultron. Not only that, but RobCo manufactured the Pip-Boy, one of the most instantly recognisable devices from the Fallout Universe!</p>







<h3 id="h-7-hubris-comics">7. Hubris Comics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hubris Comics is another iconic Fallout brand that, even if you don’t know it, you’ve come into contact with it. In the Fallout Universe, Hubris Comics publishes a range of illustrated items that users can pick up to get buffs and bonuses – namely, the Grognak the Barbarian line of comic books. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Hubris’ influence has been felt by millions of players in Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-poseidon-energy">8. Poseidon Energy</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Poseidon is an energy company, which almost immediately makes it an evil corporation in the Fallout Universe. As the world came grinding to a halt, it was iconic brands like this that squeezed every cent possible out of the citizens of the United States. </p>



<p>In Fallout, Poseidon boasted ownership of some memorable locations, like the Helios One plant from New Vegas and the Oil Rig that housed the Enclave. If that wasn’t enough, Poseidon also invented many of the franchise’s Plasma weapons. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-pulowski-preservation-services">9. Pulowski Preservation Services</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuclear protection on a budget! Have you ever seen one of the tall, cylindrical, blue devices scattered around Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76? These are the Pulowski Preservation Shelters, and they make up the backbone of a gigantic scam. </p>



<p>Upon the impending threat of nuclear annihilation, one person could buy their way into one of these street-mounted shelters, but the only issue was that they didn’t work. They’re full of skeletons of the foolish citizens who were eager to hide in them to escape the nuclear fire.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-red-rocket">10. Red Rocket</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Red Rocket is a corporation and one of the most iconic brands from Fallout, without any shadow of a doubt. It operated a network of gas stations across the United States of America in the Fallout Universe, and in the wake of the apocalypse, many of them became makeshift shelters and small settlements for survivors. </p>



<p>They’re instantly recognisable, almost always because of the large model rockets in a ‘launch pose’ on the rooftops of the gas stations littered around the wasteland.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legion-go-2-official-lenovo%E2%80%99s-new-flagship-handheld-costs-1-099-%E2%80%94-and-up.1289505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lenovo’s Legion Go <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">was a polarizing handheld gaming PC</a>, and that won’t change as the company officially announces its successor today: the new Legion Go 2 is slightly bigger, heavier, and costs <em>at least</em> $400 more than the original.</p><p>But in many other ways, it looks like Lenovo listened — and so this handheld, with its Switch-like detachable wireless controllers, built-in kickstand, and hidden optical mouse, might just be the ultimate portable PC when it arrives this October.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342995/i-played-with-the-new-legion-go-2-too">We already knew</a> its newly sculpted controllers made it far more comfortable to hold and mouse around; now, it also has 50 percent more battery and possibly the best handheld screen money can buy.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->18</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Legion Go 2’s mouse mode, unique among Windows handhelds.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Not only did Lenovo find an 8.8-inch OLED panel — with the inky blacks and gorgeous color OLED can afford — it’s a true 30–144Hz variable refresh rate screen with a native landscape orientation, meaning even games that can only maintain 31 or 32fps on its handheld chip should still give you every extra frame of smoothness over 30. The original Legion Go didn’t have VRR at all, and many VRR screens only go down to 48Hz, so 30Hz is a nice improvement.</p><p>And because Lenovo picked a lower-resolution panel at 1920 x 1200 instead of the overkill 2560 x 1600 of the original, it should be that much easier for its new Z2 or Z2 Extreme chip to deliver enough frames, too.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Spec</td><td>Legion Go 2</td><td>Legion Go</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$1,099</td><td>$699</td></tr><tr><td>Screen</td><td>8.8-inch 1920 x 1200 OLED with 30–144Hz VRR, 500-nit with 1000-nit peak</td><td>8.8-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS at 144Hz or 60Hz, 500-nit</td></tr><tr><td>Chip</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z2 or Z2 Extreme</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16GB (Z2) or 32GB LPDDR5X-8000 (Z2E)</td><td>16GB LPDDR5X-7500</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>74 watt-hour</td><td>49.2 watt-hour</td></tr><tr><td>Size w/ pads</td><td>11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches (295.6 x 136.7 x 42.25mm)</td><td>11.76 x 5.16 x 1.6 inches (298.8 x 131 x 40.7mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Tablet size</td><td>8.11 x 5.38 x 0.9 inches (206 x 136.7 x 22.95mm)</td><td>8.27 x 5.16 x 0.79 inches (210 x 131 x 20.1mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.38 pounds (1079g)</td><td>1.88 pounds (854g)</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>USB4 x2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset</td><td>USB4 x 2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Speaking of those chips, the AMD Ryzen Z2 and Z2 Extreme probably <em>aren’t</em> big upgrades over the last wave of handhelds. In fact, AMD admitted to me at CES that the Z2 is a match for the Z1E, but with software enhancements. The Z2E is a modest upgrade over the Z1E, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku8gm6vXrQs">ETA Prime’s early tests with an MSI Claw A8</a>. Every frame counts in a handheld where the latest games struggle to play smoothly, but I would hope for more. Perhaps Lenovo got more out of it — I recall the original Legion Go being a tad faster than the original ROG Ally despite using the same Z1E chip.</p><p>You can also now get 1TB of storage by default in North America, with 2TB in the highest-end config. All but the entry-level SKU have 32GB of RAM. There’s also a fingerprint reader in the power button now, which is quickly becoming a standard feature on Windows handhelds.</p><p>And those sculpted controllers, which you’ll also be able to buy and connect to the original Legion Go since they use the same mounting system, now have a proper pivot-point D-pad instead of the flat and shallow cross button of the original. They still feature drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, too, and at CES I saw that the right pad’s mouse skate accessory now locks into place so you don’t fling it off when using the FPS mouse.</p><p>I’m afraid that handheld gaming PC prices are headed the wrong direction. The Legion Go 2 starts at $1,099.99 with an AMD Z2, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. You’ll spend $1,199.99 for the model with 32GB of RAM, $1,349.99 for a Z2 Extreme with 32GB / 1TB, and $1,479.99 for the same with 2TB. I already thought the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus was pricey after MSI bumped it $999.99, and while this is pricier still, I wouldn’t be surprised if that Claw’s Intel Lunar Lake chip may be competitive with the Z2E in Lenovo’s new handheld.</p><p>But price and performance aren’t everything, and Lenovo already has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">the $830 Legion Go S with SteamOS</a> for those who need to spend a little less for good performance. The Legion Go 2 may tempt those who’d pay extra for the best Windows handheld experience — though I suspect we may be redefining the Windows part of “best Windows handheld experience” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">after the Xbox Ally X arrives</a> on October 16th.</p><p>Speaking of Windows and SteamOS, Lenovo isn’t announcing a SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 at this time, spokesperson Jeff Witt tells <em>The Verge</em>. As of embargo time, Lenovo hasn’t confirmed when or if the Legion Go 2 will get the same Xbox full-screen experience as Asus’ Xbox Ally handheld, but Microsoft has said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/682463/xbox-full-screen-windows-upgrade-ally">some non-Asus handhelds will get it in 2026</a>.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-making-of-kaiju-no-8-the-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-making-of-kaiju-no-8-the-game.1289502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, a game based on a successful manga is made <em>after</em> the anime adaptation has been airing for some time, but that wasn’t the case with Kaiju No. 8 The Game. (You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game"><u><strong>read our hands-on impressions here</strong></u></a>, by the way.) It tells its own story within creator Naoya Matsumoto’s world, as well as referencing pivotal events from the mainline narrative, and is one of the rare instances in which the game and anime were being developed in parallel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When this game began its development, the manga was only getting started,” says Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s Producer Shinya Fujita. “So there was still a lot of information that we didn’t know yet. And also at the same time, the manga was to be adapted into an anime as well. So this made it very difficult.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team started working on Kaiju No. 8 The Game more than two years ago, and the anime only started airing in mid-April last year. This meant that the game development team and the anime production effort (which involved both <a href="https://www.production-ig.co.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Production I.G</u></a> and <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/news-en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Studio Khara</u></a>) were both exploring what this world would look like in action and how best to bring the characters – and kaiju – to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://games.aktsk.jp/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Akatsuki Games</u></a> “often referred to the manga for unreleased characters, weapons, and locations,” reflects Fujita. The team also had access to Naoya Matsumoto, the writer and illustrator of the manga, and “his advice and support were crucial,” confirms Fujita, who goes on to say that he was “surprised by his deep knowledge of game development and respect for the process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that Akatsuki Games was disconnected from the anime. As its production moved ahead, the team were able to work with both studios on specific things. Fujita says that while his team looked to the manga for their character designs, they received invaluable help for the weapon designs from Production I.G, who “were able to create references that were very detailed and easy to understand”, and leveraged the expertise they’d gleaned from the likes of Ghost in the Shell. The team also received references for kaiju designs from Studio Khara, which had been brought onboard to oversee the kaiju designs in the anime; a natural fit given this is the studio established by Hideki Anno and responsible for the Rebuild of Evangelion films.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Gameplay</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The work on background designs also lined up with the anime. “We received a lot of art boards from Production I.G,” says 3D Artist Kazushi Matsumoto. “Every day we’d be checking what the new materials were. In the early stages sometimes we’d find that our 3D design didn’t match the art board so we’d have to remake it. It’s not like we had all the reference material we needed in the first place – we had to work closely with Production I.G. In the case that we had exactly the same location as the anime, we’d have Production I.G review our designs as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area that was completely separate, however, was the audio side of the game. “I deeply admire the anime's exceptional music,” says Sound Artist Yasuaki Iwata, “and the sound team is inspired by the anime's music and takes a reference [from it] while creating entirely new compositions tailored specifically for the game experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since music strongly reflects a composer's individuality,” adds Sound Director Mitsuhiro Hikino, “we carefully structured our team. We were fortunate to have experienced game composers with extensive game experience and theatrical music composers who excel at creating music that complements visuals… We centered our music around genres like Japanese digital rock and used instrumentation familiar to fans of the IP and its culture. We deliberately kept melodies subtle to prevent the music from overpowering the experience, instead allowing it to complement and enhance the impressive visuals.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Producing work that stands up next to the excellent anime was obviously important to the team, but so too was ensuring that the manga’s author, Naoya Matsumoto, was happy with their vision for his world. And sometimes that meant changing tack. Japanese mobile games often have provocative new outfits for their characters that players can acquire through their gacha system, incentivising them to invest more time and/or money in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sexy costumes… [are] pretty common in the Japanese mobile game industry,” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu. “When we proposed this plan, Matsumoto-sensei said ‘well, no – this [approach] is not for this IP.’ So we studied the IP concept again and tried to come up with some unique designs for this game.” The upshot is that the character outfits stay true to the fact that they’re all soldiers in the Japan Anti-Kaiju Defense Force or CLOZER (a specialised military outfit central to the story), keeping this game more closely aligned with the manga and anime, and reworking the concept of ‘fan service’ in the process. “The essence of the design,” concludes Kuroyabu, “is the military style.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most important of all, however, was getting Matsumoto’s blessing for Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s original storyline. It takes place at a specific time in the manga and anime’s arc, and features all the main characters. “We, the game developers, proposed ideas [to Matsumoto-sensei],” Producer Shinya Fujita explains. “We wanted to create a unique setting for the game,” so came up with the concept that Kaiju Dimensional Gates were opening up around the globe, triggering an all-in response from anti-kaiju forces. “Then, building on to the Kaiju Dimensional Gate setting,” Fujita continues, “we created the original story and then created the character Sagan Shinomiya.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/original-characters-1757049946835.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The three original characters, with Sagan front and centre.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sagan is a very important character,” Fujita explains, “because she's the only game-original character connected to the anime/manga cast.” Given how central Kikoru and Isao Shinomiya are to Kaiju No. 8’s story, it genuinely is a pretty big deal for the game to introduce Kikoru’s non-blood related sister. “We didn’t actually have any instructions from Matsumoto-sensei,” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu on whether the team had free reign to create the character, “but we proposed ideas and spent a lot of time communicating.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This included pivoting away from what Fujita describes as “a completely different character design” to find the current version which “was the better fit for this military setting.” “Because she plays such an important role, we wanted to make sure we get her right,” he concludes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Sagan is a very important character, because she's the only game-original character connected to the anime/manga cast.” - Shinya Fujita</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sagan is joined by a couple of other new characters – Chester Lochburn, CLOZER’s strategist, and Suited, CLOZER’s weapons development guru – and the team have been quite clever in how they approach their gameplay designs. Characters in this game fall into three broad categories – Attacker, Support and Defender – and as you might imagine, given their overwhelming offensive power, many of the core cast from the manga/anime fit into the Attacker category. It makes sense, then, for the new characters to help bulk out the numbers in the other roles so that players can build well-rounded squads focused on their favourite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Matsumoto on board for the story and new characters, there was still the question of how to handle series protagonist Kafka Hibino. After all, he’s simultaneously one of the weakest <em>and </em>strongest characters in the manga/anime. The team have followed Matsumoto’s lead by keeping this duality and allowing Hibino to use his Ultimate to transform into Kaiju No. 8 mid-fight, going from a pistol packing support player to an absolute beast. It really is binary too, as his transformation completely replaces his human moves with kaiju ones and strips him of his pistol in favour of bare knuckle brawling. “After transforming, he gains access to powerful abilities like AOE attacks and high-damage Ultimate, allowing players to truly feel his strength,” says Producer Shinya Fujita.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team have even created a standalone Kaiju No. 8 character that starts in Kafka’s transformed state. “While this version can't equip weapons like other characters,” Fujita comments, “he possesses incredibly powerful base stats even without them. Pretty much what this means is that in the game you can skip the process of acquiring or leveling up weapons; he's simply strong from the get go.” Even so, balance is key. “We want to avoid situations where a specific character becomes almost mandatory to progress,” explains Fujita, “or where players can't freely use the characters they genuinely want to play.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/gameplay-ui-squad1-1757050045669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 8 on the squad loadout screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also reflected in the game’s monetisation strategy – which is always a thorny topic when it comes to live service titles, but particularly those with heavy gacha components. “Our goal is for fans to enjoy playing with their favourite characters, even if it impacts rarity,” says Fujita, “[so] we provide more opportunities for casual users to collect characters and enjoy the game.” The examples he gives of this are gifting players the choice of a rare character, as well as Kikoru/Kafka at launch, plus the free characters from the pre-registration campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming back to Kafka, as you’d imagine he’s central to the game’s new story, and there’s a lot of it, with each mission bookended by cutscenes or dialogue sequences. If it feels to-the-point, that’s very much deliberate. “In the main Kaiju No. 8 story, the focus is heavily on maintaining narrative momentum,” explains Fujita, “and thus everyday life aspects are intentionally not depicted. To fill in those gaps, we created the character stories.” This is a separate mode with small stories based around the major characters. “We hope players will enjoy the casual conversations between characters and discover new parts of their personalities that aren't seen in the main story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, in keeping with the manga and anime, there are still some pretty goofy, playful sequences in the main story. “We’re trying to stay as true to the original work's artistic direction as possible,” says Fujita, while also wanting to “show a ‘cooler side of Kafka’ in the game,” as compared with how he’s often portrayed in the anime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We’re trying to stay as true to the original work's artistic direction as possible…” - Shinya Fujita</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the enemies, this is where the game really takes off. “There will be 20-30 different genres [of kaiju],” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu. A few examples pulled from the series include Wyvern-type, Lizard-type and Ant-type, but we can’t wait to see what else the team comes up with. Kuroyabu mentioned that the team were inspired by kaiju movies, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tokusatsu</u></a> genre, and utilised classic elements from those films such as low camera angles to emphasise size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The kaiju designs also have to fit neatly into a fun gameplay framework. “Our core philosophy for this game is to prioritise clarity,” explains Producer Shinya Fujita, “so we've tried to give kaiju abilities that can be inferred from their appearance. For example, Fungal-Type kaiju might inflict status ailments like poison, while Spider-Types might use web attacks to reduce your speed.” These status effects may be easy enough to counter on their own, but when the game starts throwing multiple types at you simultaneously, it’s going to get a bit more complicated. You can read more about how the game plays in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game"><u>our hands-on impressions</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the kaiju design that Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu is most excited about, it comes down to how the team are helping to flesh out existing details in Matsumoto’s world. “The one I want to call out is Kaiju No. 1,” he says. “I forget which episode [it was in], but it did show up in the original manga and anime – but only from the bust up – so no one knew what the rest of it looked like… and now we’ve designed it, so you can find out in the game! We also used this kaiju as one of our key visuals as well. It’s a special one for me.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/original-story-1757050156816.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">More than a little imposing…</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">3D Artist Kazushi Matsumoto shares a similar sentiment. “There are a lot of things that aren’t from the manga or anime that we’ve realised in the game,” he says, “so we’re looking forward to the players discovering them. Plus, we’ve prepared a lot of content for not only Kaiju No. 8 fans, but for Japanese anime lovers too.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Kaiju No. 8 The Game is out in the wild, there’s the question of what comes next. “We're planning event stories that'll let players get to know individual characters better,” says Fujita, “along with high-difficulty battle content for players seeking more challenging gameplay. And of course, we're also planning story events featuring characters in special seasonal outfits.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And presumably, in keeping with Matsumoto’s wishes, those outfits will not be overtly sexy. Regardless, “the most important thing” about running a live service game, says Fujita, “is to have love for the IP. Being a fan helps understand what other fans want.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cam Shea visited Akatsuki Games in Tokyo as a guest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost the weekend, and it’s time for another invigorating round of NYT Connections. If you’re nursing a killer streak, you’ll want to keep that going with today’s puzzle, and fortunately, I’m here to help you. Below, I’ve outlined the best NYT Connections hints for today (#817), as well as the answers, if you want the fastest solution possible.</p>



<p>Being a bit of a Star Wars nerd, today’s NYT Connections hints excited me, but once again, it was a case of the puzzle throwing a curveball to subvert expectations. Read on to get the NYT Connections clues you need to resolve today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-september-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (September 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #817</p>



<ul>
<li>HAN</li>



<li>SOLO</li>



<li>FREE</li>



<li>ZING</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>KICK</li>



<li>STAG</li>



<li>BUCK</li>



<li>SINGLE</li>



<li>SONG</li>



<li>JACK</li>



<li>TANG</li>



<li>MING</li>



<li>PUNCH</li>



<li>BILLY</li>



<li>ZEST</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words pack a sensory wallop—think of what gives a dish its lively edge or a personality its spark. You might find them in a food review or a boxing metaphor</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe someone flying solo—whether at a wedding, on a dating app, or just living that independent life. No plus-one required.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These names belong to male animals, often used colloquially or in farming circles. If you’ve ever met a goat named Billy or a rabbit named Jack, you’re on the right track.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are not just history test answers—they’re the ruling houses that shaped centuries of Chinese civilization. Think dynasties that built walls, wrote poetry, and changed the course of empires.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Being a bit of a history buff, I appreciated the nod we got to the <strong>obvious </strong>above. Admittedly, this was one of the easiest NYT Connections puzzles this week, and it didn’t take too long to figure it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-september-5-817">NYT Connections Answers for Today, September 5 (#817)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em> </em>KICK, PUNCH, ZEST, ZING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – FREE, SINGLE, SOLO, STAG</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – HAN, MING, SONG, TANG</li>
</ul>



<p>And here’s the visual solution for today’s NYT Connections:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, <em>Civilization VII</em> released to what feels like (the internet wasn't around in the 90s!) the worst reception in series history,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> its major new features dividing fans and distancing the game from what many have long loved about it</a>. Now,<a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even as the team at Firaxis work to update the game</a>, many of them are being laid off.</p><p>After a number of former Firaxis staff like artists, writers and producers, predominantly from the <em>Civ VII</em> team, began posting earlier today that they'd been let go,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2K confirmed with Game Developer</a> that there had been a "staff reduction today at Firaxis Games", with the site estimating that "dozens of workers have been impacted by the cuts".</p><p>Using absolutely meaningless filler words as cover for the move, 2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, none of which sound like they can be boosted by laying off dozens of the people who worked there.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I said in my <em>Civ VII</em> review</a>, its development sounded like a mess, which would be a strategic misstep made at levels far above those affected today by layoffs:</p><blockquote><p>It's clear something has gone very wrong during the game's development. There are now multiple<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank">&nbsp;examples</a>, both from early demos in 2024 and hidden in the final game's<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/y4pQqYr" target="_blank">&nbsp;code</a>, of&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>&nbsp;once having an almost&nbsp;<em>entirely&nbsp;</em>different interface. For that aspect of the game to have been overhauled so close to release sure would explain why things look so bland and rushed--one of my earliest notes from playing this was "looks like an iPad version of&nbsp;<em>Civ V</em>"--and why the interface was the first thing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" target="_blank">Firaxis have said</a>&nbsp;they'd be fixing, because what if they're not really fixing it at all, but just...finishing it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The game sold well, however,<a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reportedly breaking pre-order records for the series</a>. In May,<a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> said he had been "thrilled with Civ 7 so far", with the game currently sitting in the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1kluj5q/civilization_vii_is_so_far_the_8th_bestselling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> top 10 best-selling games of 2025 list</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2K Sports is officially back in the college basketball video game market. After it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports was backing out</a> of building a “college basketball experience”, 2K Sports released their own statement on Thursday night. </p>



<p><strong>“Yes, it’s true. We’re working on a college basketball experience that will feature more than 100 programs from across the country, from powerhouses to Cinderella stories,” </strong>2K <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1963775457876406534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said via social media</a>. <strong>“Competition fuels quality at all levels, which is why our approach with college basketball ensures our partner schools, college athletes <em>and</em> our players all benefit.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“More good news – you won’t have to wait long to start seeing your favorite colleges show up in game. We’ve got big plans for 2027 and beyond, and even a few surprises coming in early 2026. We’ve proven the quality of the basketball experience we can deliver for years, and have every intention to bring that same level of quality to college hoops.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-college-basketball-2k-got-here">How College Basketball 2K Got Here</h2>



<p>It’s been a weird road to get to this point for college basketball and 2K. EA originally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-announces-return-of-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had its proposal for an exclusive game</a> picked by the College Licensing Company (CLC) that would’ve included all Division 1 men’s and women’s college basketball programs. That game was planned to launch in 2028, but schools <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-might-be-in-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were hesitant to move forward</a> with the exclusivity.</p>



<p>Reports then surfaced that 2K was making a stronger effort to get licensing. The company, specifically publisher Take-Two Interactive, shifted from plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only having college teams as MyTeam DLC</a> in NBA 2K to having a full game. </p>



<p>2K already has an agreement in place with UCLA, and says that more were coming soon. Over the upcoming months and year-plus, it’ll be interesting to see what schools and conferences 2K reaches agreements with. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has previously reported that 2K sources felt a game could be released as early as 2027. Based on the statement from 2K, it appears that might actually be the case as of now. Recently, more sources have suggested that there is a plan to eventually include all Division 1 programs in a game should the first game go well. That, however, is subject to change due to it being so far in the future.</p>

<p>A survey for the game is also live</p>

Now, in an update today, the development team has rolled out a new patch for this game.</p>
<p>It addresses multiple issues and makes some other adjustments. This will also bump the game up to Version 1.0.4, and it is now available on all platforms, including Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes from Bandai Namco's game page:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy Hollow Knight: Silksong launch day to all who celebrate! I’ve only played three hours so far and I’m already overwhelmed in the best possible way. It took no time at all for me to get completely lost in the world of this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shoots-up-steams-most-played-games-chart-hours-after-launch-with-huge-concurrent-player-numbers-as-storefront-issues-ease">hotly anticipated</a> sequel, one that shortens the intimidating lead-in area its predecessor had in order to more quickly give you branching paths to pick from and the tools to explore them more confidently. It’s too early to get a real sense of where things will go, how all the changes it makes to stuff like upgrades and abilities will play out, or how big this beautiful new land truly is, but my impression so far is that Silksong is already managing to meet the sky-high expectations that have been set for it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most immediate differences Hollow Knight fans will notice is that our new hero, Hornet, isn’t the silent type like her pint-sized companion from the original. She has personality and charm, chatting with the bugs you meet across the world of Pharloom. I was initially worried that this might change the quiet tone in an unappealing way, but Hornet is still a fairly stoic character overall – confident and cautiously friendly, happy to speak her mind when she feels she should, but still reclusive in a way that allows others to do most of the talking. So it’s a shift, especially when she explains something a little more directly than Hollow Knight’s vague dialogue ever would, but one I am enjoying for the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that the writing is top notch once again. It’s often poetic and illusive in a way that never feels overly pompous, leaving plenty of room for serious characters and silly gags alike. An early favorite of mine is a pilgrim singing to a door in an attempt to open it, only for them to claim the credit when you find the lever that actually does so. All the attention to quality and detail that made Hollow Knight a true standout is still alive and well here, with areas I can’t wait to learn more about, characters I am excited to get to know, and stellar music I can already tell I am going to be listening to for a long time to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect I am excited to see evolve are the options for customization. Ability-granting charms are color-coded this time around, meaning you have to pick your priorities if certain items overlap – for example, a lot of the early options I’ve found go into the yellow slot, making me choose if I want enemies to drop more currency or if I want to have it automatically be picked up for me when they do. That choice extends into a secondary attack (the only one I’ve found so far is a quick throwing dagger), and even Crests that more drastically change your attack in a way that feels like you are swapping weapons. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honestly, I just can’t wait to stop typing this so I can dive back in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a huge amount of flexibility, and I’m excited to see if the options I will unlock let me truly start crafting coherent builds in the way I am hoping. This system runs the risk of offering a lot of false choices or leading you down certain paths that are just obviously better than others, but if Team Cherry has figured out the proper tuning, it could also open the door to supporting massively different playstyles based entirely on your own tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I imagine we’ll need to take advantage of those options, too, because Silksong isn’t messing around. It’s not afraid to punish you, such as the way you drop all of a currency called Rosaries when you die and have to do a corpse run to the location you were killed to retrieve them, and enemies can be tough enough to force you to take that walk if you push the limits of your exploration too far. That said, Silksong has a lot of ways to mitigate that punishment, such as letting you pay to stash your extra Rosaries in the form of a consumable item, giving you an early option to lose less of them on death, and not tying every unlockable to that single resource in case the worst does occur. It’s still early, but I think this will result in less frustration overall relative to Hollow Knight. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tom's Favorite Indie Platformers</h3><p>Some of the best from my favorite genre.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, one of the most common reasons people would bounce off the original was the initially sparse map system – the early areas branch in a way that meant you could miss the map for a long while, and then you had to return to town to buy upgrades before it updated or even showed you on it. You still need those upgrades, but the place you get them is now located right on your path before things start to open up, and that happens much earlier, so that’s another rough edge smartly smoothed down. It’s still a dangerous thrill when you are exploring an uncharted area for the first time, trying to push your luck in search of that next resting spot, but that’s no longer a feeling you are forced into before you’ve even found your footing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could keep digging into more early observations, but honestly I just can’t wait to stop typing this so I can dive back in. I haven’t even wrapped my head around how big this thing is going to be – and if its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Achievements_and_Trophies"><u>achievement</u></a> for speedrunning 100% completion is any indication it could be quite large, as you now have to do that in under 30 hours compared to Hollow Knight’s 20. But so far Silksong is exactly what I want from a sequel like this: it’s not completely reinventing the wheel or messing with all the things that made the first game so incredible, but it’s also not resting on its laurels. No part of it feels untouched, and as far as I can tell right now, it somehow feels even better for it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about a general malaise in the sports gaming world</a>, brought about mostly by the fact that the relentless need to release a new game every year--colliding with the ever-increasing budgets and complexity of AAA gaming--was draining the genre of innovation and chances at fresh starts.</p><p>Today, let's talk about something more positive! A rare exception to the annual grind last season was the storied <em>Football Manager</em> series, which botched its transition to an all-new engine--and a number of gameplay and interface changes that went along with it--<a href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so badly that it had to miss its scheduled 2025 edition altogether</a>.</p><p>What was initially some pretty bad news has, in the end, turned into something of a blessing for the series and its fans. With the chance to actually take a breath, developers Sports Interactive have (among loads of other tweaks and revisions) been able to deliver on a long-promised feature and bring women's leagues to the game, at a scale that makes it almost a game-within-a-game.</p><p>In<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6564634/2025/08/29/miles-jacobson-football-manager-interview-fm25-fm26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an interview with <em>The Athletic</em></a>, director Miles Jacobson says over 35000 women's footballers will now be in the game, with around a dozen major leagues also represented. Players will also be able to run both the men's and women's databases concurrently, meaning that while the option is there to play a men's or women's-only save, you can also manage sides across both at once.</p><p>If you're not a sports fan, this is an expected but nevertheless substantial update, as women's football has <em>exploded </em>in popularity over the past decade.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/bbc-sport-record-breaking-womens-euro-2025-audience#:~:text=navbar%20(on%20mobile)-,Record%20breaking%20BBC%20Sport%20broadcast%20draws%202025's,audience%20for%20Women's%20Euro%20final&amp;text=A%20peak%20live%20audience%20of,2025%20across%20all%20TV%20broadcasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The recent Euros' final broke broadcast records in England</a>, while the 2023 World Cup semi final is the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-66531590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> single highest-rating TV broadcast <em>of all time</em> in Australia</a>. So having it in <em>Football Manager</em> (when series like <em>FIFA/EAFC</em> have had it for <em>years</em>) is both long overdue but also, given the scale it’s finally arriving at, an extremely welcome addition.</p><p>Speaking of EA Sports, the interview also contains a fascinating insight into how the licensing for the women's leagues--sometimes a make-or-break factor for sports fans--have been worked around for their first inclusion in <em>Football Manager</em>. Jacobson says:</p><blockquote><p>...a massive thanks to EAFC, who have been really helpful throughout this whole process In most of the areas where they’ve had exclusive licences in women’s football, they’ve actually agreed to carve us out so that we can have licences as well. We can’t thank them enough.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Huh! While there's no <em>exact</em> release date for <em>FM26</em>, the game is coming out this year, and should be ready sometime in the next few months (they've traditionally released around October-November).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | First Look Reveal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cDQi5kwuHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I cannot stress to you how much better this looks than the 2023 edition</figcaption></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two"><h3>Seven Months After Civ VII’s Launch, Firaxis Workers Are Being Laid Off</h3></a><p>2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, whatever that means</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/football-manager-26-fm26-sports-interactive-womens-league-wsl-nwsl]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/starseeker-wants-to-be-ethical-live-service-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starseeker-wants-to-be-an-ethical-live-service-game.1289394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had the chance to play <em>Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</em> at PAX West this year and chat with Creative Director Adam Bromell. &nbsp;We get into what <em>Starseeker </em>is, why it is not <em>Astroneer 2</em>, and just what makes it different from your normal <em>Astroneer </em>experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing <em>Starseeker </em>is immediately familiar if you’ve played <em>Astroneer</em>. You have tools you know and can move around the word tearing up terrain and making it your own just as normal. You’ll even have a sweet glider that has a lot of control to get around quickly, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting parts of <em>Starseeker </em>are what surround the game and how it’s structured. It is not just another sandbox with some new mechanics, as that would be more of a sequel to <em>Astroneer</em>. Bromell wanted to make sure I knew that this is definitely not a sequel and <em>Astroneer </em>will be getting a ton of its own updates for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, Bromell told me it is a live service game, though he didn’t want to call it that. It is a living and breathing universe that focuses on cooperative gameplay and really wants to respect your time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Bromell, he wants people that have thousands of hours in <em>Astroneer</em> to be happy with <em>Starseeker </em>just as much as those that only play for a few hours a week or month. Not only that, he doesn’t want the people that don’t play as much to feel like they’re left behind either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ideally, <em>Starseeker </em>will be easy to jump in and out of and you’ll never feel the need to grind out some kind of season pass or some equivalent to get in on the newest and coolest thing. The last thing Bromell wants is to give players chores or make it feel like a job.</p>



<p>Bromell talked about how some other games have certain things in them to generate revenue that don’t feel right, that they take advantage of players. He said that <em>Starseeker </em>will never ask for money from you for any piece of content. The only thing to purchase will be cosmetic DLC, and he made sure to note that there are still a ton of cosmetics to earn just playing the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, the <em>Starseeker</em> approach will be one that wants to respect your time and not make anyone feel like they need put in a ton of work to just catch up.</p>

<h2>What is Starseeker?</h2>

<p>Where <em>Astroneer </em>is a sandbox, <em>Starseeker </em>is more mission-based and narrative-driven. You’ll spend a lot of time on the eponymous ESS Starseeker with other Astroneers. Here you’ll find missions, talk to NPCs, and you’ll see up to 100 other players running around as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking with Bromell, we mentioned <em>Helldivers 2</em> some in how they want to approach the live service. That there’s an overarching story players will be working through as they work on these missions together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to missions, <em>Starseeker</em> will task you with doing a lot of things from discovery to extraction. There will be plenty of resources and other things to collect outside of just what missions send you on as well. Mission design, however, does place a big emphasis on cooperation.</p>



<p>In the quick mission I played with Bromell, we were tasked with repairing a relay station and had to bring a sensor to the top of a huge pillar off in the distance. That meant one of us would have to carry that sensor with us on the way there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We worked together with me leading the way to dig a corkscrew through the terrain as we climbed up the tower to place the sensor up top. Along the way we ran into several different creature types we had to take down, with me using the terrain gun to shoot terrain at them to take them out.</p>

<p>That was one way to do it. We could have threw the sensor back and forth between us as we climbed as well. Really, anything you wanted to get up to the top.</p>

<h2>Mission-based But Focused on Player Choice</h2>

<p>I only had a brief 15 minutes or so with the game and the rest we talked, but everything I played felt very <em>Astroneer</em> and the idea of using this mission-based structure centered around the ESS Starseeker is intriguing.</p>

<p>Nothing about the mission design or content railroad you into playing any particular way, but we did talk some about how giving players just a little bit of direction can be great for some people. For me personally, I love when a game gives me a task and am often at a loss when just in a big sandbox, so taking the sandbox elements of <em>Astroneer </em>that work well and crafting goals for players with those strengths in mind is a great idea.</p>



<p>We didn’t talk too much on the story, but the idea of <em>Starseeker </em>is that you’re part of the group of explorers willing to go forth where no one has before, risks be damned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Content will roll out over time as the Starseeker will be parked in a solar system, exploring the planets in that system before it moves to the next system with more planets to explore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will taking a sandbox and packaging it with a narrative and missions work out? Only time will tell, I suppose. I can’t wait to see how it all comes together when it comes out next year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been over a decade since the last numbered <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. While the precision-based hack-and-slash series was sleeping, most action games went one of two ways. They either morphed into sprawling RPG adventures full of bloat or tried to ape the obsession with Soulslikes, incorporating methodical hitbox dodging and disciplined stamina management. But one of the kings of 3D arcade action is awake again and ready to dispense with all of the popular trend chasing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> is mostly a game about killing tons of guys by executing the most lethal combos and flashiest executions you can master, and it seems to be completely content with that. I am too.</p> <p>I had a chance to play a recent build of the game at Microsoft’s campus (Xbox is publishing the game) during <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025</a> ahead of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>‘s release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. The joint venture between Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta</em> makers Platinum Games appears to be going great. Rather than a disjointed sequel divided between two game design philosophies struggling with each other and the series’ infamous legacy, what I played of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> felt smooth, focused, and fun. Most importantly it exuded confidence about what it is: a high-skill action game that rewards diligent fans with satisfyingly gory thrills.</p> <p>The story revolves around returning frontman Ryu Hayabusa and a new hero, the Raven Clan’s Yakumo, as they scale a cyberpunk-infused Sky City Tokyo infested with new daemon horrors and futuristic ninja soldiers. Each character has access to different weapons and skill sets, and which you play depends on the chapter your in. The option to replay any chapter as either one unlocks after you finish, and for demo purposes I opted to go with Ryu for old times’ sake.</p>

 <p>Within seconds I was chopping off heads and staggering enemies with throwing stars. A perfect dodge gives you a small window to press the attack with a counter-strike that breaks through enemy defenses. There’s also a perfect parry that consists of attacking an enemy right as they’re about to attack you, but it’s an awkward window to exploit and doesn’t feel nearly as satisfying when you’re in the heat of combat (and for those who want a less crunchy experience, there’s an option in the settings menu to turn hitstop completely off).</p>  <p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> thrives when you’re constantly moving and trying to combo light, heavy, and projectile attacks into a conveyor belt of carnage. Doing so builds up meter to unleash special attacks or enter a time-limited transformation that alters your moveset an also makes it more lethal, culminating in stylish new insta-kill animations that swap the screen to black, white, and red. The old obliterations are there too, letting you unleash geysers of blood as you quickly execute foes already suffering from severed limbs. The pulled-out third-person camera also performed well during the demo, rarely tripping me up with off-screen attacks amid the controlled chaos.</p>

 <p>I only had time to experience the first layer or two of combat, and can see how two characters, a handful of weapons each, and all of the other secondary moves can add up into a combat system with enough depth to keep things interesting while never losing sight of the moment-to-moment satisfaction that propels a game like this forward and keeps you from rage-quitting once you hit a difficulty spike or two (there are three difficulty modes in<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em> that you can swap between at any time).</p> <p>What I’ll be most curious to see from the finished game is whether its level design will feel equally refined or just like a means to an end. The early couple of sections I experienced included some wall running, wall jumping, and grappling hook swinging, both for platforming and combat. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> has collectibles and I encountered the occasional fork in the road to explore, while statues dotting the level offer checkpoints at which to buy items from and upgrade skills.</p> <p>But most of the action was confined to flat arenas without many interesting features outside of some split elevations and grappling hook points. If Team Ninja and Platinum Games are able to imbue the later stages with as much drama in-between the big battles as during them, N<em>inja Gaiden 4</em> could be the return to demanding hack-and-slash action fans have been waiting for, perfecting the essentials and carving away the rest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-warner-bros-streak-weapons-box-office-record-opening-weekend-minecraft-2000616900">Media giant Warner Bros.</a> is suing Midjourney, claiming in a newly filed lawsuit that the AI company offers a service that creates “infringing images and videos” without WB’s “consent or authorization” and stating that Midjourney “thinks it is above the law.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/911515490/WBD-v-Midjourney-Complaint-Ex-a-FINAL-1#from_embed">The new WB lawsuit against Midjourney was filed on September 4</a> in a U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. In it, WB lawyers argue that Midjourney did nothing to protect rights holders from users being able to create images and videos using copyright-protected characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Scooby-Doo. WB’s legal team called the choice not to stop people from creating all of this infringing slop a “calculated and profit-driven decision.” It also claims that Midjourney is fully aware of the “breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement.”</p> 

 <p>In the lengthy filing, WB lawyers provide multiple examples of Midjourney’s AI generating near-carbon-copy recreations of famous WB-owned characters like The Joker and Batman. It also includes some examples of users sharing generated images of characters like Rick and Morty and R2-D2 in Midjourney’s own Discord server.</p> <p>“Midjourney thinks it is above the law,” explained WB in its lawsuit. “It sells a commercial subscription service, powered by artificial intelligence technology, that was developed using illegal copies of Warner Bros. Discovery’s copyrighted works. The Service lets subscribers pick iconic Warner Bros. Discovery copyrighted characters and then reproduces, publicly displays and performs, and makes available for download (i.e., distributes) infringing images and videos, and unauthorized derivatives, with every imaginable scene featuring those characters. Without any consent or authorization by Warner Bros. Discovery, Midjourney brazenly dispenses Warner Bros. Discovery’s intellectual property as if it were its own.”</p>

 <p>Warner Bros. isn’t the first big entertainment company to go after Midjourney.&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340"> Earlier this year, Disney and NBCUniversal teamed up</a> to file a massive lawsuit against the AI company. Disney and NBC had similar complaints and evidence as that which WB has compiled. In response to Disney suing the company, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/midjourney-disney-ai-training-lawsuit-1236481167/">Midjourney pushed back</a> and claimed training its AI on copyrighted works was “fair use” and added that “copyright law does not confer absolute control over the use of copyrighted works.” The AI company also said that Disney and other media giants want to have it “both ways,” using AI and then suing AI companies. According to Midjourney’s lawyers, the company has many accounts tied to NBC and Disney email addresses, suggesting both media giants are using Midjourney’s services themselves.</p> <p>As AI-generated content becomes easier to produce and cheaper to create, these types of lawsuits are likely to become more common, with rights-holders and artists attempting to fight back against the <a href="https://kotaku.com/leaked-fallout-merch-ai-art-target-hot-sauce-bethesda-2000622731">growing flood of AI-generated slop</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>I've previously mentioned how The Expanse: Osiris Reborn was among the most exciting S<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ummer Game Fest 2025 announcements</a> as far as I'm concerned, being a huge fan of Mass Effect, The Expanse, and Owlcat's roleplaying games.</p>



<p>Checking out a hands-off mission presentation at Gamescom 2025 only amplified all those feelings. The Mass Effect inspiration is clear and even confirmed in my subsequent chat with Game Design Director Leonid Rastorguev and Game Design Producer Yuliya Chernenko. Furthermore, the team is also paying justice to this amazing hard sci-fi IP. They're collaborating closely with the license holders at Alcon Interactive, who are reportedly checking and approving every major story beat. </p>



<p>Of course, the game's story is fully original, but it unfolds in parallel with the story of James Holden and his crew on the Rocinante. Players will see the same major events in the solar system, impacting everyone and therefore the player character and his companions as well, but they will not participate in most of the stuff. They have their own enemies and challenges. For example, they also fight with the ProtoGen private corporation, but it's a different branch from those encountered by Holden and the others from the books and TV show.</p>



<p>That aside, it helps that The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is already looking solid. The developers said it was a recent Pre-Alpha build from no more than two weeks before the German convention, and yet I did not notice any major glitches or even frame rate slowdowns. Combat looked fairly tight, too, with a mix of third-person shooting basics (cover system included) and various abilities that can be triggered to disrupt enemies, including some environmental 'opportunities' that are only available to companions.</p>



<p>There were no announcements regarding the release window, but I'm fairly confident The Expanse: Osiris Reborn isn't coming out in 2026, given its current Pre-Alpha status. There's no rush, though. The next Mass Effect likely isn't coming before 2029 or thereabouts. Anyway, below you'll find the transcribed conversation with Leonid and Yuliya.</p>

<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> In the demo, we already have two playstyles. There will be many more in the final game than those two, and those starting playstyles do not limit how you're going to develop your character, so you can go wherever you want after that. So you can switch to shortgun, maybe, or go fully into hacking or something else. It's a pretty open system. It's not like a restrictive one.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a skill system in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Something like that, yeah. However, we cannot discuss that because it's still in some iteration.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> This demo is a mission on Pinkwater Station. You've just escaped Eros Station with your identical sibling Jay and you returned to your home base office to report to your chief regarding the incident and what has happened to you and your team on Eros.</p>



<p>Your character will be fully customizable; you will be able to go through different appearances, and also, you will be able to choose between the Martian origin, the Belter Origin, and the Earther origin. They are all humans, but they have different physical appearances. Belters are born into low gravity: they are tall, but their bones are brittle, so they are slim and tall. Earthers are the shortest due to the Earth's high gravity, and Martians are somewhere in between. They are also very bulky because they train a lot. Of course, you can choose to be a male or female, and Jay will also reflect this option because they are your biological twin. So, if you choose to play as a girl, Jay will also be female. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> They will even have similar facial features. Maybe just the hair will be a little bit different.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> There's a lot of stuff going on in the station. There are some minor scenes, like someone discussing Holden and the Canterbury. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> You can explore the area and learn more about the daily life of the officers and the mercenaries you work with. Some conversations will be started by our companions, and some conversations can be triggered by our actions. Let's talk to Larry here. This dialogue is entirely optional. You can skip it to go straight to the main objective if you want. You can see he's a Belter, he's thin and tall.  He's using unique gestures that are predominantly used by Belters because they live in space and to communicate, they use those a lot.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You've just escaped Eros Station with your identical sibling Jay and you returned to your home base office to report to your chief regarding the incident and what has happened to you and your team on Eros.

They are all humans, but they have different physical appearances.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>They also speak differently, like in the books and TV show, I assume.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Yes. Larry does not use their Creole here because he works in a space where all the races come together. He works a lot with Earthers and Martians, so he uses their standard English, but some characters on Ceres station will use a lot of Creole. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Unlike the TV series, we are trying to show cultures closer to the books.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Larry told us he wants us to deliver his paintings to his mom on Ceres. It's a side quest, nothing too big, so your choices here won't have much effect, but still, it's a quest. Depending on how you do it, there are still some differences.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> This is our ship. You will learn later in the dialogue that we appropriated it - I wouldn't say stole - while escaping from Eros. It will be an important part of our story.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> In The Expanse, there is a thing called the right of salvage. If you get the ship and kill everyone who owned it before, it's technically yours now, but you need to change the transponder. Before the start of this demo, we actually met our companion Zafar, who agreed to help us change the ship's transponder. He's currently on the ship doing the technical stuff while we explore and debrief the chief of Pinkwater Station.</p>



<p>This is also one of the side characters; she's basically the merchant on the station. You can talk with her about a lot of stuff that's happening. It's just a chit chat and nothing major, but you can learn about some guys from the station and their habits. You can actually use her as a vendor and buy some stuff. We will buy this shotgun here. Those materials are used for crafting, which is basically upgrading your weapons, armor, and gadgets. We haven't shown it yet because it's still in progress. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> This is our Pre-Alpha version, so everything you see can change.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Now, we're going to meet the chief of this Pinkwater security station, and we're getting to the real choice of this mission. We can either try to convince the chief to take one for us, defend the station, and help us fight back against ProtoGen, or we can say that we will find our way out ourselves to avoid risking the lives of the station inhabitants.</p>



<p><strong>Do you need a talent to do the convincing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Yeah, it says persuasion, and we have enough to talk him into doing that. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> If we didn't, we would fail to persuade. </p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> It's not a dice roll; it's more like a flat check. If you have it, you have it. So, he has decided to fight back with us. Now, we need to get to the ship and run away. We are the threats. If we're not there, they will not kill everyone.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> You will see that ProtoGen is fighting. Because we decided to resist, our guys from Pinkwater will help. This is basically our combat. You can see we have shooting and a range of abilities. The enemies have different patterns. Jay, as our sibling, is helping us, though it's not our usual mission because we have only Jay in the party. Usually, you will have two active companions.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Here, you can see we have a destruction system. You can actually demolish a lot of stuff, and it's not entirely cosmetic because some of the covers can also be demolished, exposing characters to damage. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> This works both ways, so your enemies can also destroy your cover.</p>

Usually, you will have two active companions. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you have friendly fire in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> We are still working on the decision about friendly fire. We are still iterating on that part. It might be related to the difficulty level.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> This is kind of a teaser of our main idea on how to use all the companions. You will have two in the party, but we also wanted the others to help. So, we are ensuring that even though companions might not be in your squad, they're still engaged in the story and the mission. In this case, our companions on the ship are guiding us and helping us escape ProtoGen.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> That's where we want to differ from the other games in the same genre, because even if you take two companions with you, the others don't just sit idly on the ship. They try to be useful. They contact you over the radio to give you some advice. They might even appear in the mission in a particular place, or they might have a particular role in the mission. You need to assign them to this role so that they will have other stuff to do during the mission.</p>



<p><strong>Kind of like in Mass Effect 2's iconic suicide mission.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> That was the inspiration, yes. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Basically, the idea is that we wanted you to feel like a team, and it's weird when the team is sitting on the ship and you're risking your life on the mission. They are helping, working together.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Here, you can see we didn't have the science skill, so we can't use this one. There's a failed skill check. Depending on how you level your character and your companions, you will have different skills, and with different depths in the skill. You might be able to use some of these skills and skill checks. You can't block yourself out of the story missions if you fail some skill checks. Still, sometimes it might be something very simple, like a chest locker, or it might be that it unlocks a whole new area of the map with some optional content. </p>



<p>Now, we can ambush the next group of enemies. We could have chosen the most straightforward approach, but we decided to ambush, and so now we have the opportunity to use this mechanic. This is what we call combat opportunities: exploiting structural weaknesses to our advantage. We can ask Jay to do it.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> It is a unique feature to companions, basically. Because you'll have different companions, the kind of opportunities they might be able to use might differ. But what's important is how we emphasize companions during combat scenarios.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> You can also see that different enemies have different mechanics. There was a guy with a shield, which can be destroyed. Now, Zafar is actually advising us to go outside, on the outer surface of the station, to avoid fighting in the corridors, which are already filled with soldiers, and we are trying to go around.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> That means we're actually going into space, which is an integral part of The Expanse. We have these zero-G space segments. We put a lot of effort into our zero-G space experience and are still putting a lot of effort into it.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> You still hear the sound because you're actually touching the station's surface, so you're getting all the vibration through your boots. You can also walk on any surface. If you are walking on a surface that is different at a different angle, the camera will adjust slightly to make it easier for you.</p>



<p>You can also see that the locomotion is slightly different because we're running in big sliding jumps. It's easier to do it this way in a low-gravity environment.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Because it's a The Expanse game, we also have magnetic boots, which are essential to staying alive in zero-G.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> The sounds are different and the visuals of the blood is different because not only is there no gravity, but it is also a vacuum. By the way, here's an ability to show the enemies behind the covers and with my other ability that adds armor-piercing bullets, I can actually shoot them through the cover, because I see where they are.</p>

And because it's a The Expanse game, we also have magnetic boots, which are an important part of staying alive in zero-G.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There's no melee combat build, though, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> No, we will have a close combat build, but mostly with the shotgun or stuff like that.</p>



<p><strong>Can you take down enemies stealthily from behind?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> No.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> In zero-G combat, you have different angles. Sometimes it might make your life easier, sometimes it might make your life a little more challenging. Now Leonid's character got downed, but he didn't die and asked Jay to revive him.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> You can also see that the grenade I used is not ballistic. It doesn't use gravity to go down. It has its own thrusters because otherwise, I wouldn't be able to use it in space.</p>



<p>What we're doing now in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is extremely dangerous because the maneuvering thrusters are quite weak. If you miscalculate and go off course, you'll be lost in space forever and die.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> We're trying to be as hard sci-fi as possible, so we have the Coriolis force. That's why physics is dragging the character to the side, because the station rotates to the right. Space is a dangerous place.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Obviously, we are skipping parts of this mission's exploration and some additional loot just because we don't have time to show everything. Now we have another choice: Zafar is saying they will help us from the ship, but Jay also spotted a hatch nearby. We can choose either to wait for Zafar to do something or just to escape now. But we will trust Zafar. He will actually appreciate it later, because if you don't trust him, he will be disappointed.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a relationship system with the other companions in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> It's not like a mechanical system, but the game has a lot of choices and consequences that affect your companions, yes. We don't have 'this guy will remember it.' It's more organic.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> And we're still in the development with companions, so we cannot talk too much into details.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> We can see the consequence of our earlier choice here. The station tried to fight back against ProtoGen soldiers, and that led to some Pinkwater soldiers dying. If choosing otherwise, there wouldn't be destruction and death here; they would survive. There is a lot of environmental storytelling and some notes to read, just to see how the station worked before, how they lived, and how they trained.</p>



<p>You can read some notes, but some are encrypted. If we had the hacking skills, we would hack the computer and get some more information, maybe even something valuable. But there are still some other things to be found in this area. For example, we can find the code for the armory and grab something useful there. However, it's kind of empty now because our colleagues were collecting weapons to defend themselves, but there is still some stuff left.</p>



<p><strong>Would it be more stocked if you made the other choice?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Now, ProtoGen is irritated that we're getting away and their leader sends their best troops. Those are highly advanced guys with lasers and a protomolecule armor which we cannot penetrate with bullets, so they are basically unkillable for us. But Larry came to our help and closed the blast doors, so they can't reach us.</p>



<p><strong>Are there many weapons in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> A couple dozen, maybe more. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Definitely enough to find something that suits you and your play style, taking into account different builds. By the way, cover works usually really well because your health regenerates after a while, but if you sit too long, it may be dangerous because enemies move through the combat arenas and try to flank you.</p>



<p><strong>Do you already have different difficulties?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Yes, we have Normal and Hard even now in this demo. We are playing on Normal. </p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> There will also be a Story mode.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Some of these decisions will have long-lasting impacts on the game. You never know which one, though.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> This is our ship; Zafar is on it. We need to get on the ship, and we're trying to undock it. We tried to release the clamps holding it, but one malfunctioned and had to be rebooted manually. We'll go down to manually reboot the clamp, and then we will be free to run into the ship and escape the station. Zafar is helping us clear the way from the spaceship with a PDC (point defense cannon). </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> This is another example of how companions not in the party might influence what's happening during the mission.</p>



<p><strong>Do you know if the book's original authors (Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham) are aware of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn and if so, are you getting some feedback from them? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> We can say that we're working closely with Alcon at this point and they are quite satisfied with what's happening for now.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>This mission is still very early in the game, so you cannot skip it. It will be right after the Eros mission, but after that, you will have a solar system to explore. You can go to Earth, to Luna, to Mars, Ceres Station, and Ganymede, and to IO; there is a lot of stuff, including companion-specific side content.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How old is this The Expanse: Osiris Reborn build you're showing at Gamescom 2025? Is it recent?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> It's recent, yeah. I think we finished it two weeks ago.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Since we moved from cRPG games to triple-A ARPG, development takes longer. If you want to make any change, you need several days, maybe weeks, so any change takes much longer now. We have to be more cautious about the decisions we're making.</p>



<p><strong>Did you work on Owlcat's previous cRPG projects?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> I did not. I came for The Expanse. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> I worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>. I started as a game designer there.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of the differences did you find in the switch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Everything, actually. It's very similar and a lot of our previous experience is helping us, but at the same time, sometimes what you think was working in a cRPG game and you think should still work in this type of game, it doesn't. It could be different reasons, just because of the budget, as everything is more expensive, or just because the way the storytelling is done is different. We've added cinematics, which have become a huge part of our storytelling. We had to learn new tricks to do that via cinematics and not this big book-style text.</p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> In terms of process, it's a totally different team and different tech because we are doing an Unreal Engine game and our previous games were in Unity. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> And it's console first for instance, now, so that's why we're showcasing it with the gamepad. Our previous games were mostly PC games, so there was also a mentality shift.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the estimated length of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Last time I checked, it was about the length of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. So you can expect 20, 30 hours of gameplay.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> It's definitely not as long as our previous games, but it will still be emotion-packed.</p>



<p><strong>There's also going to be some side content, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> Sure, The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is not a linear story-driven game. There is a lot of side content. This mission is still very early in the game, so you cannot skip it. It will be right after the Eros mission, but after that, you will have a solar system to explore. You can go to Earth, Luna, Mars, Ceres Station, Ganymede, and IO; there is a lot of stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Is any of that side content companion-specific?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> I think it's safe to say there will be some companion-specific content, yeah. </p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Companions are our main focus in general.</p>



<p><strong>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-qa-its-a-very-good-match-for-us-because-of-the-stories-we-want-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously spoke with Alexander Mishulin in a remote interview</a> and he told me that there is also romance in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> Yes, definitely. We can't say who, with whom, and how, but romance is a must-have. </p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> We can say that not every companion will be romanceable.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking of companions, can you upgrade them in some way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leonid Rastorguev:</strong> You can change some of their equipment, including weapons. They have their own abilities, and you can also level them up and give them skill points.</p>



<p><strong>Yuliya Chernenko:</strong> It will be less versatile in comparison to your main character's progression, though.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-layoffs-fifa-22-ea-sports-fc-microtransactions-profi-1848945221">Electronic Arts</a> is seemingly giving up on its plans to develop a new college basketball game and letting 2K Sports make one instead, according to a leaked email obtained by <em>Extra Points</em>.</p> <p>A little background: <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">In June, EA Sports teased online</a> that it was developing a new college basketball game, which would have been the first from EA since 2009’s<em> NCAA Basketball 10</em>. So a lot of fans were excited about the news. However, there was a problem. <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465">2K also had video game plans</a> that involved college basketball teams and players. Unlike EA’s plan to develop a whole video game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967">2K wants to create college basketball</a> DLC for <em>NBA 2K</em> and/or a new mode in the game as a way of testing the waters for a full, standalone release later. And despite the College Licensing Company asking schools to sign EA’s deal, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-ncaa-2k-hoops-ucla-2000621071">it was reported last month</a> that many Division 1 schools were taking 2K’s deal instead. As a result, EA is taking its digital ball and leaving.</p> <p><a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/ea-sports-college-basketball-may-be-in-big-big-trouble">As reported by<em> Extra Points</em> on September 4</a>, a leaked email from EA Sports VP of commercial licensing Sean O’Brien to multiple college licensing directors seems to indicate that the publisher is giving up on its plans. In the email, O’Brien wished the schools “good luck” while expressing that everyone at EA was “disappointed” that “some schools” were “choosing to accept” 2K’s deal.&nbsp; Here’s the full email:</p> <blockquote><p>Hi…I hope you had a great Labor Day weekend.</p> <p>Given there are some schools choosing to&nbsp;accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in <em>NBA 2K</em>, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded.</p> <p>Everyone at EA SPORTS is disappointed that we all couldn’t find an acceptable path forward, but we appreciate your support in trying to bring a stand-alone college basketball game with all men’s and women’s Division 1 institutions and student athletes, conferences as well as the NCAA, in a way that fans have told us they want.&nbsp; We really appreciate your support.</p> <p>Good luck with back to school and an exciting start to the football season.</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Sean O’Brien<br> VP Commercial Partnerships &amp; Licensing<br> EA SPORTS</p></blockquote> <p>Of course, it’s also possible that EA Sports purposely leaked this email to <em>Extra Points</em> in an attempt to use angry fans to pressure schools into accepting its game proposal. “See,” EA can say. “Blame 2K and the colleges for not letting us make a whole new game. Enjoy your DLC instead.” That’s pure speculation, but even if that wasn’t the plan, it’s likely that fans hoping for a new college basketball game in the future aren’t going to be happy that EA is giving up, while 2K is reportedly just doing DLC for NBA 2K.</p> <p>Is this wild saga over? Will EA actually make a college basketball game after all? Will 2K get bullied into changing its plans? Who can say? <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">But considering how well <em>EA’s College Football 25</em>&nbsp;game sold last year</a> and how much money a college basketball game could make, I imagine we haven’t seen the end of this.</p>

<p>A new Ghost of Yotei trailer shows off one of Atsu’s newest weapons, the brash odachi, in combat gameplay. </p>



<p>The highly anticipated sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, Yotei looks to live up to what came before and more. Following a vengeful mercenary on the hunt for her family’s killers, the game has been rolling out new content every week. Now, a month from the October 2nd release date, we’ve got new footage of a new weapon in Atsu’s arsenal: the odachi.</p>



<h2 id="h-atsu-slices-and-dices-with-odachi-in-new-ghost-of-yotei-trailer">Atsu Slices and Dices with Odachi in New Ghost of Yotei Trailer</h2>

<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei -  Ōdachi Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8ivos7Bnjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ivos7Bnjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the trailer above</a>, we see protagonist Atsu unleash another weapon in her collection, the odachi. A longer version of the katana, the weapon’s length can shorten the distance between your blade and an enemy. While not as fast, it can deliver devastating blows to foes and thin a crowd should you be overwhelmed. </p>



<p>Weeks prior, we’ve seen footage of the kusarigama, yari, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-firearms-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firearms in action</a> in Ghost of Yotei. With the odachi trailer out, it leaves the dual swords, katana, and bow left. It does fit quite nicely with the timeline, ending right near the upcoming release date. As one of PlayStation’s biggest titles of 2025, fans won’t have to wait long to get their hands on it, especially if they are at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tokyo-game-show-2025-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo Game Show</a>. Still, given the many accolades Ghost of Tsushima received at launch, Yotei may live up to the Ghost moniker in the Game of the Year discussion.</p>



<p>Are you going to use the odachi in Ghost of Yotei? Looking forward to its October 2nd release? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steve Jackson Games has announced another collaboration with Critical Role. Their newest project, <em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em>, combines the addictive, zany card gameplay of Munchkin with the heroes, villains, and events of the actual play series' first campaign.</p>

<h2>The <em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page, <a href="https://munchkin.game/products/games/munchkin-vox-machina/" rel="nofollow"><em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em></a> is based on the first campaign of Critical Role. The campaign that made Critical Role into the wildly successful multimedia company that it is today, producing blockbuster TTRPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> and beloved animated shows like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-2026-release-for-legends-of-vox-machina-s4-announces-fifth-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/munchkin-vox-machina-game-board.jpg?itok=y5rfuNFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/munchkin-vox-machina-game-board.jpg?itok=0curuzqX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The core gameplay is still the same Munchkin goodness. Explore, get loot, defeat monsters, and reach level 10 before anyone else does.It is the same malleable core loop that made <em>Munchkin</em> a household name since 2001, spawning countless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-munchkin-babies-game-spits-up-over-tables-in-2022" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spin-offs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">collector's editions</a>.&nbsp;The game is designed for 3-5 players ages 10+ and takes about 1-2 hours to finish.</p>

<p>Like their previous collaboration, <em>Munchkin Mighty Nein</em>, you play as a member of the iconic adventuring party. Each character has a thematically appropriate special ability. For example, Grog Strongjaw's <em>Heart of Gold</em> gives you a power boost if you help or get help in an encounter. The set will even include a d20 for some tabletop-themed shenanigans.</p>

<p><em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> contains more than just the titular party. The game is packed with support characters like Shawn Gilmore, devious foes like Delilah Briarwood and Thordak, Leader of the Chroma Conclave, and powerful items like Percy's pistols and legendary Vestiges of Divergence like the Titanstone Knuckles.</p>

<p>A copy of <em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>172 Cards</li>
	<li>7 Character Cards</li>
	<li>A Deluxe Game Board</li>
	<li>7 Standies with Plastic Stands</li>
	<li>A Six-Sided Die and a Twenty-Sided Die</li>
	<li>A Rulesheet</li>
</ul><p><em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> will be available in retail stores on March 2026. It will be sold at an MSRP of $39.95.</p>

<p>The upcoming Street Fighter film now has an official release date: October 2026.</p>



<p>Originally being distributed by Legendary, the live-action adaptation of the iconic Capcom fighting series is coming to theaters soon. In the past few months, the cast has slowly been revealed. With Warrior’s Andrew Koji and The Recruit’s Noah Centineo as leads Ryu and Ken, the ensemble is quite fitting of the franchise. From rapper 50 Cent as Balrog to wrestler Cody Rhodes as Guile, fans are excited to see it come to life. Fortunately, as filming continues, the movie now has a new distributor, as well as an official theater date.</p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter-film-now-distributed-by-paramount-synopsis-revealed">Street Fighter Film Now Distributed by Paramount, Synopsis Revealed</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Street Fighter film now releasing Oct 16, 2026 under Paramount </p><p>Logline: “Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior… <a href="https://t.co/7bK7UEnkCY">pic.twitter.com/7bK7UEnkCY</a></p></div>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963680725808390578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Paramount Pictures is now distributing Street Fighter. The studio inked a deal with its previous distributor, Legendary, for three years. With the news, the studio revealed the official release date: October 16th, 2026. The film had started filming earlier last month, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-noah-centineo-ken-tease/">teases of looks</a> from several actors.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the first synopsis of the Street Fighter film is now out. The logline, shared by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, is available below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don’t, it’s GAME OVER!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, new cast members have been announced, filling out the roster. This includes Reacher’s Olivier Richters as Zangief, Cobra Kai’s Rayna Vallandingham as Juri, SNL’s Kyle Mooney as Joe, and Mortal Kombat’s Mel Jarnson as Cammy. </p>



<p>There’s a lot riding on the new adaptation of Street Fighter, to say the least. Previous Hollywood adaptations have been decent, despite some great casting like Raul Julia as M. Bison and Ming Na Wen as Chun-Li. Still, there’s a lot of potential with the series and, with the recent Hollywood successes of Minecraft and Fallout, perhaps Street Fighter will join them.</p>

While reacting to that news, former THQ vice president of studio operations Richard Browne shared a few of the reasons why Titan Quest 2 wasn't released almost two decades ago.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7358661819734921216/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%2C7358864581047341056%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287358864581047341056%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%29" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/09/03/former-thq-vice-president-the-development-of-titan-quest-2-was-first-approved-19-years-ago-but-it-was-halted-due-to-marketing-issues-and-the-lead-game-designer-not-being-pr-friendly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game World Observer</a>), Browne noted that THQ had given the greenlight for the sequel in 2006. However, the development team at Iron Lore Entertainment couldn't get past THQ's marketing department, which rejected the proof-of-concept demo.</p><p>"[Titan Quest] was one of those games that just sold and sold; but our marketing department didn't see it," wrote Browne. "We had a great 360 demo with the camera lower and controlled--they nixed it using 'Emsense' to show that the demo (three months work) didn't resonate."</p><p>Emsense utilized sensors that monitored players' heart rate, breath rate, and other factors to measure their response to a given product. Because Titan Quest 2 didn't get a favorable response through Emsense, that was one of the justifications for shelving the project.</p><p>Browne also mentioned that the marketing team wasn't eager to work with the game's lead designer, Brian Sullivan, whom they considered as "not being PR friendly."</p><p>"Brian was great," recalled Browne. "He [was just] a khaki shorts, black socks, and loafers kinda [guy] and that made their job hard."</p><p>Titan Quest 2 eventually ended up in development under Grimlore Games for THQ Nordic. The sequel is currently only available on PC during its early access period. But the game will eventually be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>
