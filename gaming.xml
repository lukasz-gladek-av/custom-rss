<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/powerwash_simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> racked up some pretty impressive crossover DLC in its time, and its sequel looks like it'll start doing the same next year.</p>
<p>FuturLab has today lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>'s first DLC pack, featuring none other than a handful of locales from the beloved Cartoon Network series, <strong>Adventure Time</strong>. We don't have all that much information on what areas from the Land of Ooo will need a scrubbing, though the developer has confirmed that there will be <em>five</em> of them, each of which can be tackled with up to three pals.</p>
<p>Here's all of the information we have on the DLC so far from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4173830/PowerWash_Simulator_2__Adventure_Time_Pack/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clean Up Distant Lands</strong><br>
Who wants to play video games?! Clean up five new levels from the Land of Ooo. Don’t worry, everything stays right where you left it, but just a little bit cleaner.<br>
<strong>Grab Your Friends Or Adventure Solo<br></strong>Homies help homies, always. So, brave the filth solo, grab your BFF to clean through the campaign together, or grab your 4-man band to shred schmutz in free-play.<br>
<strong>What Time Is It?<br></strong>It’s not quite Adventure Time… yet! UNACCEPTABLE, we know, but we’re still putting the finishing touches (aka: dirt) on everything. Right now, you have only an approximate knowledge of what’s to come, so be sure to Wishlist, join the Discord and follow our socials to stay up to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no precise release date on this one just yet, outside of a vague 'Spring 2026' window, so we'll be keeping an eye out for more details in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has denied that it has any kind of partnership with controversial streaming service Kick, following a string of social media posts by the latter that could be construed to mean otherwise.</p><p>Yesterday, the official Kick X account <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001095322265862315/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">posted an image</a> of two people shaking hands, one of whom is holding a package that bears both the Xbox and Kick logos. The image was accompanied by text that simply read "kick (handshake emoji) xbox".</p><p>That image was preceded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2000732922005848225" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">an animation</a> that resembles the original Xbox's startup sequence (but with the Kick logo replacing the Xbox branding, of course), and was succeeded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001458279126532297" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a video</a> showing someone unboxing a Kick-themed original Xbox.

<figcaption>Kick's recent social media posts seem to strongly imply a partnership with Xbox.</figcaption>

The app is currently being "actively evaluated", and if it's found to breach Xbox's policies, it will be removed.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-66044165" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">garnered controversy</a> since its foundation in 2022, partly due to its close links to the gambling industry; while Twitch has banned gambling-related content from its platform, Kick still hosts gambling streams, and its founders, Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani, are also behind crypto casino Stake.</p><p>The platform has also become known for welcoming creators who have been banned or censured by other services, including the likes of&nbsp;Félix "xQc" Lengyel and Kaitlyn "Amouranth" Siragusa, among others.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has reportedly introduced a new fee that it's asking some of its Enterprise customers to pay, and the "minimum commitment" for which the engine is apparently asking is not small.</p><p>According to <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/unity-risks-fresh-backlash-with-new-fee-demands-this-feels-like-blackmail/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, emails have been sent out by Unity this week targeting "bigger Unity customers" and detailing a new fee that begins at $250,000 and rises to $2 million for the largest proponents.</p><p>The fee, apparently referred to as a "minimum commitment program" by Unity, supposedly "requires that [developers] pay Unity a specified minimum commitment amount at the commencement of each Subscription Year", with the fee based on gross revenue earned by the developer in question.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is just one of the many games that was made in Unity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Mobilegamer.biz's sources, developers with revenue between $25 million and $50 million will need to pay $250,000 to Unity, with the amount rising in direct proportion to revenue. Those who have made over $250 million will need to pay $2 million of that to Unity.</p><p>The engine says that the fees will go towards "your purchase of Unity subscription license and support products", and Mobilegamer.biz's sources claim that developers are threatened with termination if they fail to pay the new fee.</p><p>It probably goes without saying that Unity can ill afford another hit to its public relations right now; the company is arguably still recovering from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c2e9dbd5-693e-4701-a45d-1f172ca61b44" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the controversy</a> that was ignited after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d8418f6-6d83-477d-97b7-f18aa50e0a89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the introduction</a> of the so-called "runtime fee" in 2023.</p><p>In that particular case, Unity <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed48a89b-b13e-4d2a-b975-298530ddbc6a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reversed its decision</a> fairly swiftly, and then-CEO John Riccitello subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61146301-1035-4016-acad-04d27c632ca1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>. Whether this fee will have a similar effect remains to be seen, but it would seem to be an ill omen for Unity's future direction, at any rate.</p>
<p>Unity hasn't technically announced this new fee in a public-facing capacity, so we'll have to wait and see if it decides to do so and what the reaction will be if and when that happens. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Party Game (Just Dance 2026 Edition) Is 50% Off After 80K+ Sold, Still Arrives Before Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-party-game-just-dance-2026-edition-is-50-off-after-80k-sold-still-arrives-before-christmas-2000654283</link>
            <guid>1387321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="906">With the holiday season right around the corner, many people are preparing to spend long afternoons and evenings gathered with extended family under one roof. While that time together can be meaningful, it can also be challenging to keep everyone entertained for hours on end. After the big meals are finished and the conversations start looping, it helps to have a fun activity ready that can pull everyone together. A lively party game is often the perfect solution, and <strong><em data-start="473" data-end="498">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em></strong> fits that role beautifully. Instead of sitting around scrolling on phones or drifting into awkward debates, family members of all ages can jump up, move their bodies, and share a few laughs. Even better, there’s a timely deal that makes it easier to justify adding it to your holiday lineup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/">Amazon is currently offering the Nintendo Switch version at half off, dropping the price from $50 down to just $25.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="906">A Party Games Everyone Can Enjoy</h2>
<p data-start="908" data-end="1716">One of the biggest draws of <em data-start="936" data-end="961">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> is its impressive music lineup. The <em data-start="998" data-end="1010">Just Dance</em> franchise has been a staple of rhythm and dance gaming since its debut in 2009 during the Wii era, and its longevity speaks to how well the formula still works. Year after year, Ubisoft continues to refresh the experience with new tracks that appeal to a wide audience. This latest entry includes 40 new songs spanning modern pop hits, beloved throwbacks, and internet-fueled favorites. Players can dance along to chart-toppers like “APT.” by ROSÉ &amp; Bruno Mars and “Houdini” by Dua Lipa, as well as classics such as “Counting Stars” by OneRepublic and Madonna’s “Hung Up.” I’m personally most excited by the inclusion of “All Star” by Smash Mouth.</p>
<p>If you already own older versions of the game like <em>Just Dance 2024 Edition </em>or<em> Just Dance 2025 Edition</em>, you don’t have to worry about splitting your content across different menus. All your songs are accessible in one unified platform. Online play is also streamlined, allowing friends to dance together regardless of which yearly edition they own. On top of that, players can subscribe to Just Dance+, which unlocks hundreds of additional tracks and rotating in-game events.</p>



<p>Beyond being a crowd-pleasing party game, <em>Just Dance</em> also doubles as a surprisingly effective fitness tool. For those looking to stay active during the colder months, Workout Mode offers a fun way to build movement into daily routines. Instead of forcing yourself through a repetitive exercise plan, you can burn calories while dancing to music you enjoy. It’s a great option for players who want something more engaging than traditional workouts, whether they’re dancing solo or with others.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the physical version of<em> Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> doesn’t include a game cartridge. Instead, the box contains a download code that you redeem on your Nintendo Switch, after which the game is downloaded directly to your console.&nbsp;If you don’t want to wait and just want the code, you can order the digital version. Though it is still full price at $50, so it might be better to just wait for the empty box to ship.</p>

<p>The ver. 1.1 update, 'The Threads of Fate', will launch at some point in "<strong>Early 2026</strong>" (the studios haven't been more precise than that at the moment), and will bring a healthy dose of new content alongside the usual tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<p>First up is a batch of new 'Mystic Ordeal' challenges, which will let you add challenging quirks to your runs to put your skills to the test — you'll even be able to set your own rules and share them with others via a code. Select stages of your journey across Talamh will also become corrupted, with stronger enemies therein granting bigger rewards. Don't worry if you're finding the base game challenging enough; both of these will be completely optional.</p><div><figure data-videoid="NHONnA_kS_M" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytNHONnA_kS_M" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed64cc89qrtznp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The devs are also introducing newly evolved mounts that pack more of a punch, and a batch of fresh in-game skins and emotes, so you can get your party looking as sharp as they deserve.</p>

<p>The devs shared a full rundown of the upcoming changes in a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673">Steam</a>, concluding by thanking everyone who has played so far: "We wanted to take a moment, once again, to thank you for joining our rebellion, and lending your skills, passion and personality to our resistance movement."</p>
<p>We had a great time with Absolum on Switch earlier this year, calling it "one of the best of its kind, whatever that kind may be" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">9/10 review</a>. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long in 2026 to see its updates come our way.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/aion2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">Another five games have received support</a> for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation this week, including Yakuza Kiwami 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and ARK: Lost Colony. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-dying-light-the-beast-update-1-5-nightmare-experience/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> adds support for ray-tracing, Lost Ark added support for DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA put out a new GeForce Ready game driver to support it all.</p>



<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">the return of Splitgate 2</a>, and the first Splitgate, as developer 1047 Games has opted to try and mash together the best of both games into one offering for players. It arrived as a free-to-play game on PC and consoles everywhere as of yesterday, December 17, and has support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to ensure that you can get the most out of your hardware. It's also the exact kind of game you'd want to play at the highest frame rate possible, as a competitive first-person shooter.</p>



<p>If you are playing it, that is. Splitgate 2's launch went very poorly, and, while SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, at least on PC, the release of Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m">doesn't seem to have turned things around</a> when looking at the concurrent player numbers.</p>



<p>For Yakuza Kiwami 2, a recent update to the game added DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, and now, if you load it up alongside the NVIDIA app, you can boost your experience further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with the app's DLSS overrides.</p>



<p>MMORPG Ashes of Creation, which recently launched as a new early access title on PC, also did so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. Also, speaking of SteamDB numbers, it's one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4124950/charts/">trending games on the platform at the time of this writing</a>. </p>



<p>ARK: Lost Colony and AION2 are the final two games to round out the five that are getting support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, with AION2 getting support on December 24, 2025, as part of a new update, and ARK: Lost Colony featuring support for DLSS 4 today as part of a new update.</p>



<p>Lastly, today's new GeForce Game Ready driver will ensure that you're able to jump into all of these games without issue, as it fixes a colour issue from the previous driver and several other bug fixes.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/should-you-give-up-on-half-life-3-no-not-while-work-continues-on-hlx/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, the hopes of the Half-Life community were sparked by rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 is not only in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">active development</a></strong>, but also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">in the polishing and optimization phase</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/"><strong>close to an announcement.</strong></a> Now that we are so close to the holidays, however, it's unlikely that even a company like Valve that operates on its own set of rules will announce the project before the end of the year, as previously rumored.</p>



<p>The now-legendary game not being announced in 2025 has shattered the hopes of many, who no longer believe a new entry in the series will be released in the near future. However, the lack of an official announcement shouldn't make you lose hope, as the project rumored to be the third entry in the Valve series hasn't been abandoned. On the contrary, it has received a new update which is sure to spark new hope in fans.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV"><strong>Tyler McVicker</strong></a>, who has provided an in-depth look at the latest updates made to the HLX project found in the Source 2 engine in the past, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/commit/5688664efb6b3a0e6a52abec53f8d0d7990d1f71"><strong>Dota 2 December 16 2025 update</strong></a> introduced new strings of code directly related to the project rumored to be Half-Life 3.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Based on how the Half-Life community lately, should I even make a video detailing the dump of new information found in the latest DOTA 2 update? </p><p>I don't know...</p><p>I guess this game doesn't exist.... Oh well.... <a href="https://t.co/nFcNYv9ynt">pic.twitter.com/nFcNYv9ynt</a></p></div>— Tyler "Hype Merchant" McVicker (@Tyler_McV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/2001331835373265408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While an in-depth explanation of what these new additions mean for the HLX project has yet to be provided, the community verified that these updates are real and confirmed on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">this comprehensive community-managed Miro board</strong></a> that they are related to the Animgraph 2 system, a new animation resolve system designed to replace the previous system, which caused large bandwidth consumption in multiplayer games. For those not interested in game development, these additions are still important to know about, as it is undeniable proof that the development of HLX is proceeding.</p>



<p>What these updates don't suggest, on the other hand, is when the HLX project will be officially revealed. According to rumors, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/">Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch game targeting a Spring 2026 release</a></strong>, so if these plans haven't changed, it shouldn't be long until we will finally learn if and how the iconic series by Valve will continue following the VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-unveiled-next-month/"><strong>Half-Life: Alyx.</strong></a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione have announced that they’ve repaid all the money they borrowed to develop their Surrealist horror game Horses, despite being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">denied release on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ban-santa-ragiones-horses-just-before-release-with-a-weird-reminder-that-adult-only-nft-games-are-fine-though">the Epic Games Store</a>. It’s a better outcome than expected, given Steam’s centrality to PC gaming, and a strong demonstration of support for art that is prepared to disregard taboos and investigate something profoundly ugly. It’s also, however, not enough to keep Santa Ragione operational. </p>
<p>As warned when they broke their silence about the Steam ban last month, the developers are suspending operations and looking for other work. It’s possible they’ll get the band back together down the road, but this “will not be easy”.</p><!--more-->
<p>According to Santa Ragione, Horses has sold 18,000 copies across all platforms since launch on GOG, Humble and Itch, generating around $65,000 in net revenue. Back in November, the developers told us that they had borrowed roughly $50,000 from friends to complete development, following the Steam ban, with the overall budget running to $100,000.</p>
<p>“After paying the royalties owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of HORSES, these proceeds will be sufficient to repay the loans we took to finish development,” reads a press release, sent to RPS last night. “We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved.</p><p>“At the same time, this result is not enough to begin production on a new game,” it continues. “The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.”</p>
<p>Steam rejected a work-in-progress version of Horses in June 2023. The platform holder’s reasons for doing so remain unclear, but according to a Valve statement circulated by Santa Ragione themselves, the platform holder’s reviewers were concerned about depictions of "sexual conduct involving a minor". The developers subsequently altered the game to make all the characters visibly over 20 years old. They have also argued that while Horses does contain portrayals of sexual abuse of many kinds, it does not seek to arouse or glorify.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviewed Horses</a>, and while I haven’t played and therefore can’t speak for the WIP build from June 2023, this absolutely isn’t a work of child pornography. It’s a story of sexual oppression and brutalisation, which considers censorship as a form of sadism. The violence it depicts is portrayed as being technologically mediated via both an in-game projector and various self-referential pieces of design. It very clearly isn’t intended to be received as ‘unfiltered’ representation and endorsement. To claim otherwise is to misunderstand the game or, worse, twist it out of context.</p>
<p>In this week’s statement about sales, Santa Ragione write that the Steam ban precipiated “a prolonged scramble for funding, with debt, opportunity cost, and team members taking other work”. In other words, the studio had already begun to fragment long before Santa Ragione went public about Valve’s decision.</p><p>The developers also note that while Horses has been a relative hit at launch, the game will miss out on the long-term revenue from Steam’s many sales and bundle offers. “Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles,” they write. “These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like.” </p>
<p>I’m interested to hear more about the key distribution situation. Santa Ragoine have previously criticised Valve for declining to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" featuring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>, their previous well-regarded horror game.</p>
<p>The developers conclude by refocussing attention on Valve’s role as de facto industry regulator and censor, given the size of its share of the PC gaming market. They write that stronger-than-expected sales of Horses “should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. </p>
<p>“For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly,” the statement concludes.</p><p>To continue the theme from that closing sentence, the news that Steam had banned Horses came following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a wider crackdown on adult games</a> across both Valve’s platform and indie storefront Itch.io. This summer, Valve and Itch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">altered their</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">submission terms</a> to give international payment processing networks a say over the definition of acceptable adult material.</p>
<p>The payment networks themselves appear to have tightened their rules <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">under pressure</a> from anti-misogyny groups and anti-pornography activists with ultra-conservative leanings. There is a counter-campaign underway to force the payment networks to reverse policy, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.com/post/3m7gd2poyk22y">organised</a> by community figures such as journalist and Youtuber Ana Valens. We will likely have more reporting on the subject next year.</p>

              <p>OLED gaming monitors used to mean choosing between your rent money and screen quality, but that gap keeps shrinking: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/">LG’s 32-inch Ultragear just hit $876 on Amazon, dropping $523 from its $1,399 list price</a> to reach an all-time low right before the holidays. This isn’t some Black Friday leftover either, as <strong>Amazon guarantees delivery before Christmas if you order soon</strong>.</p>
<p>The combination of <strong>4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, 0.03ms response time and true OLED blacks</strong> makes this monitor work equally well for competitive gaming sessions and those movie nights when you want visuals that actually impress.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Flexibility Really Means Something Useful</h2>
<p>The Dual Mode feature is more important than most marketing fluff because it really changes how you use the monitor every day: When you’re playing open-world games or story-driven games where graphics quality is more important than quick reactions, <strong>switch to 4K at 240Hz</strong>. When you’re playing competitive shooters, MOBAs, or racing games where every millisecond counts and clarity isn’t as important as responsiveness,<strong> use a hotkey to switch to Full HD at 480Hz</strong>. That 480Hz mode isn’t just a number on a spec sheet: it really does make motion blur almost invisible when you pan the camera quickly or flick it quickly.</p>



<p>The<strong> 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time</strong> gets rid of ghosting and trailing that slower panels have, which is especially noticeable during dark scenes or when characters move quickly. This speed is possible because OLED technology lets each pixel turn on and off right away, instead of waiting for liquid crystals to twist like LCD panels do. You’ll be able to see enemies coming out of the shadows faster, follow moving targets more accurately, and play the game in a way that feels like it’s connected to your inputs instead of lagging behind them.</p>



<p>LG added Micro Lens Array+ technology to this Ultragear which boosts<strong> normal brightness to 275 nits and peak brightness to 1300 nits</strong> which makes it the brightest OLED gaming display in their lineup. That brightness is more important than you might think, because OLED monitors can have trouble in bright rooms but this panel does well against window glare and overhead lights. The VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification means that the monitor meets strict industry standards for both brightness peaks and the very deep blacks that OLED displays are known for. The 1.5 million to 1 contrast ratio gives images depth that LCD monitors can’t match. It shows details in dark game scenes that would be lost in murky gray on lower-quality displays.</p>
<p>The a<strong>nti-glare coating</strong> cuts down on reflections without adding that annoying grainy texture that some matte screens have which means you can focus on the game instead of having to change the lighting in your room all the time. The built-in speakers make surprisingly punchy bass-driven sound that works for casual gaming and streaming without needing external speakers.</p>
<p>The LG Switch app turns the monitor into a productivity powerhouse between gaming sessions by letting you split the screen into up to six customizable sections for doing more than one thing at a time. You can manage video calls, look through documents, and keep an eye on chat windows all at the same time. You can also switch between your PC input and the built-in webOS streaming platform for Netflix and YouTube without having to touch your computer.<strong> DisplayPort 2.1 and USB Type-C connections</strong> make sure your setup will work with next-generation graphics cards and give you enough bandwidth to push 4K at 240Hz without compression.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: In a market where similar specs usually cost $1,200 to $1,500, $876 for a 32-inch OLED gaming monitor with dual refresh modes, HDR 400 certification, and sub-millisecond response times is a great deal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After comments this week from Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealing that the </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> developer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>using generative AI in its workflow</span></a><span> prompted a massive backlash on social media, several developers have been weighing in. While Vincke said most of Larian’s workers were “okay” with how the team had integrated the technology, the public outcry </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934"><span>from fans and developers</span></a><span> told a different story. The latest games industry veterans to weigh in include </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> lead Daniel Vávra and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-co-directors-new-game-couldnt-be-more-different-2000653042"><span>ex-Naughty Dog director Bruce Straley</span></a><span>, and both of them seem to think generative AI is here to stay in game development, though one of them is at least standing firm against the trend for now.</span></p> <p><span>Vávra posted a lengthy response to Vincke’s statements </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169"><span>on X</span></a><span>, saying that while he’s “no fan of of AI generated art,” detractors need to “face [the] reality” that it’s here to stay.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>You know what I hate most about making games? The fact that it takes 7 years and 300 people and tens of millions of dollars to make. And the fact that Tom had to spend 500 hours in the studio recording completely generic heckling and generic bars.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I’m all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won’t have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they’ll have to focus on the essentials.</span></p> <p><span>I have ideas for lots of games, but I’m fifty years old and so far it’s taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I’m all for it.</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LarAtLarian</a>  said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy shitstorm. </p> <p>I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2. I don't… <a href="https://t.co/l7pNbTxeIT">https://t.co/l7pNbTxeIT</a></p> <p>— Daniel Vávra ⚔ (@DanielVavra) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Vávra goes on to raise a bunch of hypotheticals about being able to ask NPCs anything and the technology generating appropriate answers and so forth, as if human writers can’t generate something more interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Straley, meanwhile, also believes that generative AI is here to stay, but </span><a href="https://x.com/bruce_straley/status/2001390353262457071?s=20"><span>says that he’s taken a stance against it</span></a><span> at Wildflower Interactive, though he admits that he might not be able to do so forever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We don’t need AI,” Straley said in an interview with </span><i><span>Kinda Funny</span></i><span>. “I really do think it’s the demise of the human species. Our brain…we need a frontal lobe. Hundreds of thousands of years of this supercomputer that’s built, and they’re making football fields and draining water supplies, etc. to try to replicate something that a human can already do. It just doesn’t make sense to me.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is AI needed in gaming? Bruce Straley (Co-Director of TLOU) gives his thoughts. <a href="https://t.co/msJdOS9Rlm">pic.twitter.com/msJdOS9Rlm</a></p> <p>— Kinda Funny (@KindaFunnyVids) <a href="https://twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids/status/2001337156812296647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>It’s nice to hear someone like Straley taking a stance against using generative AI, though it is disheartening to hear that he also thinks it’s an inevitability that it will stay in the industry. Vávra says that “absolutely everyone else is” using generative AI in some capacity in game development, and if that’s true now, it doesn’t have to be. You can want better for your creative medium than plagiarizing slop machines that leave talented people out of work. If believing that bad things don’t have to happen is foolish, then I’d rather be a fool than an AI shill. </span></p>

            <p>Falcom, creator of the Trails in the Sky and Y's series, has revealed during a recent shareholder presentation it has begun using AI during game development, stating they are proceeding "cautiously", but that it's been used in the early stages of development nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Umisuika/status/2001526978164539420#m">As reported by Umisuika on X</a>, attending the shareholders meeting in-person, a Falcom representative stated: "We are proceeding cautiously due to legal issues. We are using AI to brainstorm scenarios and do research. What used to take 2-3 hours can now be completed in 10 minutes. AI is also used to correct typos in the scenario."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is a rough translation from Japanese to English using Google's in-built browser tools, and therefore the intricacies of this statement could be off. Even so, it is seemingly a confirmation that Falcom is integrating AI into its workflow.</p>

<p>It is no secret that Japanese video game companies have started embracing AI en masse. At Tokyo Game Show this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of polled developers acknowledged that AI has been used in game development</a>. Sega has stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">it'll start using AI "appropriately" in spite of pushback</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix wants AI to do 70 percent of its QA by 2027</a>.</p><p>It is far from a topic isolated to Eastern game development though. Only this week, the CEO of Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">met firm backlash following an interview in which he revealed that AI was being used at his studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">acting unions continue to stand firm against the technology and the dangers it poses to the people they represent</a>.</p>

As <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-first-quarter-fiscal-2026">part of its earnings report</a> released on Wednesday, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said “tight industry conditions” across DRAM and NAND flash memory are expected to “persist through and beyond” 2026 as AI drives up demand.</p><p>With the AI boom in full swing, Micron is making more money than ever as companies like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Google fill their data centers with powerful chips that come packaged with high-bandwidth memory (HBM).

Micron also expects to start production at a new manufacturing facility in Idaho in 2027, followed by a new plant in New York in 2030.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/847344/micron-ram-memory-shortage-2026-earnings]]></content:encoded>

              <p>If you like watching your favorite shows and movies wherever you go, a streaming stick is a veritable must-have. You can use it on just about any TV, and cue up all the streaming services you have in one place, all with one device. It brings popular streaming apps together in one place and turns almost any TV into a smart TV without taking up space or adding clutter. and in the case of the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD, it’s super easy to use. Plus, it gives you access to Amazon’s library as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">If that sounds like something you need to add to your travel arsenal, or just want an easy way to devour content at home, it’s just $19 at Amazon right now, down from its usual price of $35.</a> That’s a discount of $16 and 46% off. For a streaming device that covers most major platforms and includes a voice remote, an entry fee of less than $20 is pretty generous.

<p>You can even use the Alexa Voice Remote to search with your voice. And honestly, since sometimes typing things in on a small remote can be annoying, that’s one of the most useful parts of the experience. Instead of typing with on screen keyboards, you can press the microphone button and say what you want to watch instead of taking the time to search for each letter. That makes it especially useful if you’re letting kids have free rein of the streamer, because they can just say their favorite show or movie and find it instead of fumbling with the remote.</p>

<p>The memory shortage is hitting the GPU market. A new report suggest Nvidia is preparing to cut down on production of its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="http://www.boardchannels.com.cn/thread-130069-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BoBantang</a> via <a href="https://benchlife.info/nvidia-will-adjust-geforce-rtx-50-suppy-due-gddr7-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, Nvidia is looking to reduce supply of the latest series of cards by as much as 30-40% compared to the first half of 2025. The report adds that this is being done due to the memory shortage for GDDR6 and GDDR7 RAM. Across the industry, this shortage has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer prices skyrocket</a> as AI companies buy up all of the available supply.</p>







<p>In addition to the original report, Benchlife adds that various AIC partners and suppliers have told the outlet that the first cards to likely be cut back are the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060Ti 16GB.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Nvidia hasn’t confirmed or denied the report. Insider Gaming has made attempts to contact Nvidia for an official statement on the matter, but, so far, all requests have gone unanswered. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>
