			<p>Sonic’s kart racing series should have usurped that red dungaree-wearing handyman years ago. This is a character whose very reason for existing is to go fast, while Nintendo’s portly plumber would only really be rushing to deal with a nasty water leak. However, that’s not the case. While Mario Kart is a literal system seller, the Sonic Racing series tends to drift into second place, a valiant effort, but one which can’t make its speedy hero quite fast enough. Can Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds be different?</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Come Race on Our Level Commercial" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYOfP1a7xjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds feels as though someone saw Ratchet &amp; Clank’s dimension-hopping mechanic and decided to borrow it for a racing game. After the first lap of each race the leader can choose the CrossWorlds track, shifting the action to a completely different zone and introducing a random element into the mix. You might be zipping along through one of Sonic’s casino tracks when suddenly you’re transported to a watery pirate world, or flying through the air above a glorious technicolour meadow.</p>


<p>In theory, it’s an interesting idea, but in practice, it doesn’t give you the same sense of wonder that you might expect, serving instead to take away from the sense of racing on a single track, perfecting the racing line or finding shortcuts, and besting your opponent. It’s just… a bit random, and this is a racing game that already has a lot going on. That’s compounded by many of the tracks just not being all that engaging, and for all that they’re drawing on Sonic’s back catalogue, they might just show that Sonic’s levels aren’t all that interesting…</p>


<p>There’s multiple mechanics at work in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and the Gadget Plate gives you a level of customisation to tailor your kart to your particular preferences. Each Gadget alters your kart’s performance in some way, giving you additional boosts or upgrading specific weaponry to give you an edge against the cavalcade of characters that fill out the game’s roster. They introduce an element of customisation that’s clearly a bit unbalanced, with Gadgets turned off for online modes just days before the game released, but they certainly add something interesting to your offline loadout.</p>
<p>That customisation extends to your vehicle as well. Having definitely looked over the fence into Mario’s garage, you can now select different front and rear parts and alternate tyres for your kart. These also alter your kart’s performance, as well as giving you a dose of visual flair to play around with, letting you customise the colour scheme and add decals too.</p>
<p>It’s an odd mix of decals, filled with gaming partners like ROG and MSI, but then with Air Asia and Beyblade ones too. It’s nice to have the option, but it feels a bit half-baked, with decals unable to be stacked or placed on the side of your car, and if you change any of the parts, it completely resets the decals for that section. The result? You’ll probably give up on decals.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, the shift from Sonic and Sega All-Stars to Sonic Racing means that this is a character roster largely made up of the hedgehog’s pals, rather than from the wider Sega lineup, and it’s a real shame. Sure, we’ve got Hatsune Miku at launch, with Joker and Ichiban coming in a month or two, but the other external characters from Minecraft and SpongeBob – and their associated tracks – are only available as paid DLC, and it’s not out yet.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, beyond Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik this is a bunch of characters that will probably raise little more than a shrug, even for Sonic fans. OK, I’ll give you Big the Cat, but who wants to play as Charmy the Bee?</p>
<p>That contributes to an overall lack of charm. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is certainly bright and colourful, and there’s the odd cheesy Sonic song, backtalking between rivals, and the occasional track that really stands out, but it feels relatively lifeless next to Mario’s last two karting outings. Sonic Racing Transformed was a real celebration of Sonic and the Sega brand, but this just lacks the same soul.</p>

<p>It does at least provide a fairly decent dose of karting. Drifting for speed boosts, performing rapid tricks and flips in the air, and battling it out with rivals can easily have you on the edge of your seat, and as you’d hope, playing with others in multiplayer only makes that stronger. It is chaotic though, and there’s a sense of unfairness that lurks in each corner. The overall lack of identity extends to the weaponry too, and there’s nothing here that’s as iconic as you’ll find in Mario’s series, or even earlier Sonic racing games.</p>
<p>Besides the regular Grand Prix modes, and the selection of speed classes, there’s also the option of Time Trials and the Race Park, a collection of different racing challenges that’s ideally set up for multiplayer, but can be played solo with an AI team if you want. They mostly mess with the formula a bit, so you can race in a team where hitting your teammates gives you both a burst of speed, or a multiplayer battle race where your team have to get the most item hits in. They’re an OK diversion, but they only really serve to emphasise the chaos of the races. I soon headed back to the regular Grand Prix.</p>

<p>There’s elements here that do work really well, from the customisation of the Gadget Plate and your kart to the Jukebox that lets you mix and match your racing soundtrack. Fundamentally though, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds biggest problem is that it doesn’t feel like it rewards you for racing well. Rivals shoot off into the distance, never to be seen again, while rubber banding keeps everyone bunched up behind you. That’s not fun, it’s frustrating, and no amount of dimension hopping and DLC characters can cover that up.</p>
<p>While it gets plenty of the fundamentals of right, the dimension hopping, character roster and some of the extra modes don’t quite stick the landing. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds isn’t the best karting game out there, and thirteen years on from Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed, it’s not even the best karting game with a blue hedgehog in it.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-preview-%E2%80%93-torpor-less-in-seattle.1301397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a number of grand mysteries laid out before you in the opening hours of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">which I previewed last month</a>. Who, exactly, are you? Why have you been trapped in torpor for the last century? Who is this voice that’s in your head? And is there any saving Seattle’s vampire community as the Prince is murdered and everyone suddenly struggles for power?</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of these mysteries are quickly unpeeled –&nbsp;Phyre, your player character, is a legendary Elder Vampire known to many as the Nomad, while Fabien, the voice in your head, was until very recently a PI, who’s been indelibly bonded into Phyre’s mind at the time of his death –&nbsp;while others are deepened as the politics, backstabbing and coterie of characters starts to come to the fore.</p>


<p>Our second hands on with Vampire: The Masquerade –&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 picks up right after where we left off with our first, but it’s still a sudden change of pace. You see, instead of playing as Phyre, I suddenly find myself as Fabian, who’s been called in by the club’s owner to meet with Pandora. Pandora, though, has been murdered in a particularly grizzly fashion in the club’s backroom, staked on lengths of rebar and with her head ripped off.</p>
<p>Exploring the scene highlights plenty that’s odd or wrong about this, but there’s something nagging at the back of Fabian’s mind. As he engages his Malkavian abilities to gain more insight, he’s bounced back even further to when he was a baby of a vampire in the 1920s, and an eerily similar murder of a cigarette girl, scouring this site now for clues to take back to his sire and the sheriff of the time.</p>


<p>I love this layered narrative approach, and while the opening hours of Bloodlines 2 are clearly rather guided to get you into the story, I’m really keen to see how the ties between different time periods and the mystery wrapped around Phyre and Fabian continues to unfold.</p>
<p>Brought back to the present as Phyre wakes up –&nbsp;this was just a dream of Fabian’s memories, it turns out –&nbsp;and there’s more pressing matters at hand. The new Prince has one especially troublesome thorn in their side that you might be able to help with, as Sheriff Benny has gone completely rogue and gone on a bloody rampage across Seattle to kill anyone he deems to be too inferior –&nbsp;Thinbloods and Ghouls, in other words. Would you mind helping out, and maybe the Prince will let you stick around in the city?</p>
<p>There’s a clear lead we can take here, trying to trace Benny to his usual hangout, a garage in a corner of town, which is being staked out by the Anarch Ghouls that he’s been waging his single vampire war against. It’s here that we find Benny’s own Sire, a surprisingly young-looking vampire who brought the tempestuous Benny into the fold, way back when. We’re able to use dialogue and persuasion to get him to open up, convince him that Benny needs to be caught and brought back to the Prince to face justice, while learning a bit about Benny’s personality along the way. Can we catch up to Benny and bring him in without a fight?</p>
<div id="attachment_462937"><p id="caption-attachment-462937">Not Anarchs, but these are enemies.</p></div>
<p>The trail takes us to a building site, once again surrounded by Anarchs, and with a clear bloody trail that Benny’s left behind him as he’s been both hunter and hunted, and plenty inconveniences in my way to catch up to him. On this occasion I specced up Phyre as a Tremere, able to use blood sorcery for long-range attacks, and rapid hit and run strikes and it was immediately a lot of fun trying to figure out and plan how I was using my abilities, saving up and spending blood charges earned from draining enemies while taking them out – easier when being sneaky, but vital when in the thick of combat to also restore health.</p>
<p>I leant on three key abilities during this, with Recall letting me place a warp point somewhere safe that I could teleport back to after striking at an enemy, perhaps gliding across or dropping from above before fading away. At the same time, I could cast a Blood Curse on an enemy so that they explode the next time that they take damage, which is hugely useful for taking out tougher enemies, but comes with a time cost to cast at longer distances and when they have higher health. Still, cursing someone from a distance and then hitting them with a brick was eminently satisfying. Finally, Cauldron of Blood could paralyse and fix an enemy in place, screaming from the torment, which is great for temporarily thinning out a group of enemies or letting you close a gap.</p>
<div id="attachment_462938"><p id="caption-attachment-462938">The Blood Curse ability in action.</p></div>
<p>Working through a string of combat encounters, I really enjoyed stringing these together, scrapping through moments that didn’t go quite to plan, and happening across some fun surprises. You know, things like being able to pick up guns – using telekinesis, of course, because who’d want to touch a gun? – and blast away at enemies. It makes a nice change from yeeting bricks.</p>
<p>It built up to a big battle with Benny, having failed to talk him down, and here using a mix of Cauldron of Blood to freeze him in place to I could Blood Curse him was massively effective. Alas, I never quite had the chance to grab guns of any Anarchs that dropped in to interfere with our fight.</p>

<p>With Benny brought low once more, the narrative side of the game could kick in once more. Katsumi, the leader of the Anarchs stepped out of the shadows demanding that Benny be left to face their own justice, and after wriggling my way through that, the Prince saw fit to offer me a job.</p>
<p>It’s at this point that the game will really open up and, while I could have explored Seattle before this point, the narrative will look to take advantage of the open world setting. While it might not play into the specific fantasies that the original Bloodlines did, of creating your own character and navigating this world as a Thinblood, I can’t deny that I’ve enjoyed exploring this character of Phyre, their inherent power and some contrasting abilities and combat styles, and the narrative possibilities that Fabian offers. There’s just around a month to go before the full game’s release on 21st October, but I’m looking forward to venturing into the snow-blanketed nights of Seattle.</p>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch; Nintendo Switch 2 later in 2025</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Sonic may not need a car to get around, but a hedgehog has to rest his feet from time to time, and Sega's mascot has amassed a fairly hearty collection of racing games over the years. While most of these racers have struggled to escape the shadow of a certain mustachioed rival's racing efforts, a few have managed to stand on their own and carve out respectable fanbases. Now, only a few months after the big release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the blue guy is also hitting the asphalt again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>



<p>Is this one of Sonic's more successful turns behind the wheel? Or is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds an easy one to cross off your list? Read on to get up to speed...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds mostly sticks to the modern mascot-racer formula, with vehicles that seamlessly transform whether they're on land, water, or in the air, a large collection of different items to frustrate your opponents with, and a focus on earning boosts by drifting around corners and doing tricks.</p>



<p>Past Sonic kart racers differentiated themselves a bit by offering somewhat more realistic driving physics, but that largely goes out the window with CrossWorlds. This game’s vehicles don’t feel like they have much weight or momentum as you take corners, with even Mario Kart's vehicles feeling like they have more inertia. To be clear, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's controls are perfectly responsive; they're just very arcade-y and can take some time to get used to. Thankfully, the game still delivers a proper Sonic-like sense of speed, with even races played on standard middle-of-the-road speed settings feeling pretty peppy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players also have some new freedom to customize their rides and abilities (yes, characters and vehicles are now chosen separately). Prior to races, players can mix and match vehicle parts and a variety of "gadgets" that offer an array of buffs. The latter goes deeper than the former, as there are a fairly limited number of vehicle parts, but around 70 gadgets that can alter your racing experience in sometimes rather novel ways.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's array of items are very derivative of recent Mario Karts -- the red and green boxing gloves are just Red and Green Shells, the Blue Wisp is a Mushroom, the drill-like Yellow Wisp is a Bullet Bill, and so on. But hey, Mario Kart's items are generally pretty fun and well-balanced, so, by extension, this game's items are also pretty fun and well-balanced. While you will get those occasional moments when a sure victory is snatched away mere feet from the finish line, I didn't find CrossWorld’s weapons too overbearing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Much like Mario Kart World before it, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is somewhat fixated on changing the way individual races and Grand Prix cups are constructed. After completing the first lap of a race, whoever is in first chooses between two Travel Ring portals, upon which all racers jump to a CrossWorld track with a totally different theme for the second lap. Sometimes, these CrossWorlds will even have a Frenzy modifier attached, which may make the lap more difficult, or simply more intense, by doing things like flooding the course with warp rings. For the third lap, you return to your original course, although you’ll find it's now been modified with new hazards, shortcuts, and other changes. Each Grand Prix offers three unique courses, with the fourth race consisting of a single lap from the previous three races smashed together.</p>



<p>The CrossWorld gimmick is a neat-enough trick (albeit one that’s pretty much directly lifted from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) and it does introduce some unpredictability to races. That said, while there are 24 regular tracks in the game, there are only 15 CrossWorlds, and in my experience, certain ones came up more often than others to the point they become a bit over-familiar.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of over-familiar, there’s no getting around the fact that Sonic Team was doing some heavy cribbing from Nintendo, particularly Mario Kart 8, when designing this game’s courses. While Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's tracks are perhaps a bit narrower, their loopy, gravity-defying designs are <em>very</em> Mario Kart 8, and many of the themes feel almost directly copy-pasted — here's the treetop track, here's the spooky track, here's the dinosaur track, and so on. It's honestly a bit shameless and makes Sega's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">revive their old "Genesis does what Nintendon't" era marketing tactics</a> for CrossWorlds a bit questionable. More like Sega does what Nintendid a decade ago, amirite?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>‎That said, all snark aside, while they're a bit obvious in their inspiration, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's courses aren't <em>bad</em>. Quite the opposite, really. Mario Kart 8 is a great game, so it's a good source to take notes from. CrossWorld's tracks are intense, sometimes trippy, and fairly visually impressive (a move to Unreal Engine 5 mostly pays off, with only occasional stutters when approaching Travel Rings on PS5). In fact, I’d wager some of the folks disappointed by the more open and breezy approach of Mario Kart World may appreciate these Mario-Kart-8-flavored courses, particularly when combined with CrossWorld’s amped-up sense of speed. Ironically, Sega is offering an alternative to Nintendo by cribbing from Nintendo's own past.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, while Sonic keeps pace with Mario pretty well when it comes to on-road action, CrossWorlds lags behind pretty badly when it comes to content and ways to play. Unlike many earlier Sonic racers, there's no story mode here, with Grand Prix being pretty much your only single-player option. With only 8 cups available at launch, you'll be able to see most of what Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has to offer within 3 or 4 hours. Of course, there are different speed classes, difficulty levels, time trials, mirror tracks, and a roster of rivals to best, but it all comes down to replaying CrossWorld’s somewhat modest collection of tracks and Grand Prix cups over and over. The Race Park multiplayer mode allows teams of players to tackle races with various extra objectives attached (collect the most coins, etc.) but this is just more somewhat transparent remixing of the same limited content.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>More Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds racers, vehicles, and courses are coming, but almost all of it, particularly the crossover content featuring the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants and others, is locked behind a $20 season pass. Of course, racing game season passes are nothing new, but it's hard not to be a bit put off given how quickly the core game races to the finish line.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/loving-hollow-knight-silksong-play-these-six-metroidvania-games-next</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/loving-hollow-knight-silksong-play-these-six-metroidvania-games-next.1301391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> finally released this month after years of teasing and development (can you believe a build was playable at E3 2019?). This is a game so anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">it broke the Nintendo eShop the morning it launched</a>, with countless players praising <em>Silksong's</em> gameplay, challenge, and boss battles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But once the credits roll, you might find yourself craving even more Metroidvania exploration, and we have some recommendations to help fill that hole. Here are six Metroidvanias we recommend checking out if you loved <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong!&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><em>Metroid Dread</em></h2>

<p>Though it's silly to call a <em>Metroid</em> or a <em>Castlevania</em> game a Metroidvania when the genre is named after these titles,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-dread" rel="nofollow">Metroid Dread</a></em> is one of the strongest games that the series has seen in recent memory. The best-selling <em>Metroid </em>game of all time, <em>Metroid Dread</em> brings players into the action immediately and does an incredible job of allowing you to explore organically without overly guiding you.</p>

<p>Where other Metroidvanias can feel a little overwhelming, <em>Metroid Dread</em> is manageable and gives you a steady drop of powerups and upgrades to keep the gameplay interesting and the story moving. If you haven't checked out this Nintendo Switch <em>Metroid</em> game yet, especially ahead of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Beyond</em>, we recommend picking it up.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metroid-dread-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Dread</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>An excellent title that came out just last year,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown" rel="nofollow">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a></em>&nbsp;is a refreshing take on the franchise. This sprawling Metroidvania not only boasts colorful and beautiful art direction, but it also gives players crisp controls that make the many platforming sections and boss battles feel very intuitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> also offers some much-appreciated accessibility options, like a Guided Mode that can highlight where your next objective is. If you prefer the classic Metroidvania feel, though, Exploration Mode is the right choice for you. For a super fun, accessible experience that gives you plenty of upgrades and accessories to equip along the way, be sure to check out <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space" rel="nofollow"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Animal Well</em></h2>

<p>Many of the Metroidvania games we recommend you play after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>fall into the 2.5D HD category, but <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-well" rel="nofollow">Animal Well</a></em>&nbsp;is a deviation that fits securely into the 2D space. Beautiful pixel art and inspiring level design come together to form this experience that quickly became a fan favorite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Animal Well</em> is designed with layers of puzzles and secrets, though how deep the player descends into these secrets is mostly up to the individual. Many of the items collected have multiple uses, and the explored rooms can offer multiple connections to keep you guessing and working through puzzles during the entire experience.<em> Animal Well</em> exists with minimal exposition, giving the player the opportunity to fully explore and enjoy this world on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Well</em> review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>The sequel to 2015's <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ori-and-will-of-wisps" rel="nofollow">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a> </em>came along in 2020 and expanded on the original's Metroidvania concepts.

<h2><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>A true <em>Castlevania</em> spiritual successor (developed by Koji Igarashi, who previously worked on every Metroidvania installment in the franchise), <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night </em>stands out in a crowded segment. If you enjoyed <em>Symphony of the Night</em>, many of the elements carry over to this title, with countless secrets to uncover and a litany of items to collect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players will find a sprawling, meticulously designed castle and engaging combat awaiting them if they choose to check out <em>Ritual of the Night</em>. Fluid gameplay and engaging boss battles come together to make an experience that you won't soon forget. If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has you craving more excellent game design,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>is an excellent choice.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Axiom Verge 2&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Sequel to 2015's <em>Axiom Verge</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/axiom-verge-2" rel="nofollow">Axiom Verge 2</a> </em>builds on its predecessor by offering impressively detailed biomes to explore and a variety of upgrades to pick up along the way. The pixelation of the world doesn't take away from any of its beauty—in fact it adds to it—and the fluid gameplay allows you to effortlessly explore and uncover the secrets awaiting you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many Metroidvania games focus on the strengths of a single character, <em>Axiom Verge 2 </em>offers players both a human form and a drone form that they can transform into, unlocking additional traversing capabilities. If you found&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s&nbsp;combat a little too punishing, you'll be pleased to know that much of the combat in <em>Axiom Verge 2</em> is optional. This experience does an exceptional job of providing you with a detailed and expansive world to explore, making it a great option for those looking for a Metroidvania after <em>Silksong</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What Should I Play After <em>Silksong?&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>These are just six titles that we recommend you check out after playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, but Metroidvania titles are some of the most robust across the gaming landscape, ensuring there's something for everyone. Likewise, if you haven't played <em>Silksong</em> yet and are looking for an appetizer, these titles can be a great way to ease you into the world of Metroidvanias.&nbsp;</p>

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Corsair wasn’t joking around when it named the new $99.99 Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless gaming mouse. At 36 grams, it weighs just a bit more than seven US nickels. Is that <em>too </em>light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s new Inzone mouse</a> is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games.</p><p>Even so, it doesn’t seem like Corsair cut too many corners to reduce the weight. The company claims its tiny 210mAh battery can last up to 70 hours per charge over a 2.4GHz wireless connection with its default 1,000Hz polling rate. The Sabre V2 Pro also supports 8,000Hz polling, letting your PC register a movement or input at 0.125ms, but battery life will dive to just 16 hours per charge in that mode. Peripheral makers love to brag about 8,000Hz polling, but most people’s reaction speeds aren’t anywhere close to sub-millisecond sensitivity, so you can probably save your battery.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro has a symmetrical shape, but is built for right-handed for PC gamers, with two thumb buttons on its left side. Corsair includes grip tape that can be applied to the main buttons and to the sides to customize how it feels to hold.</p><p>Tweaking this mouse’s DPI, macros, and other settings won’t require a software installation. Corsair is launching a browser-based configurator for the Sabre V2 Pro. This is slowly becoming the norm with PC gaming accessories geared toward pros. Allowing access to settings via a browser makes it easy to quickly make adjustments from any internet-connected PC, which makes them more useful during tournament play.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro is available now in black or white.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items.1301385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic is continuing its attempts to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a platform that’s bigger than just battle royale — this time by giving creators the ability to make and sell in-game items. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">Starting in December</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to sell items directly from the islands they’ve built, using new tools that will be launching later on.</p><p>The benefit, of course, is that creators on the platform will have a new revenue stream (currently, they earn revenue primarily based on engagement numbers). And Epic says that they’ll normally earn “50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands,” though through 2026 that number will temporarily be at 100 percent presumably to encourage developers to take part. As for what “V-Bucks value” entails, well, it’s a complicated calculation.</p><p>Here’s Epic’s explanation:</p><div><blockquote><p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite’s average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.</p></blockquote></div><p>In terms of actually creating these items, Epic says that creators will be able to utilize “a Verse-based API and new UEFN tools to create and offer purchasable durable items and consumable items in their games,” and that details are coming “soon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in November Epic will be adding a “sponsored” row to <em>Fortnite</em>’s discover feed, which will let creators spend money for increased visibility for their islands. Also coming is a community tool that will let creators speak more directly to players for sharing updates and soliciting feedback.</p><p>Notably, Epic says that it will be taking a cut of both the sponsored row and user-created item sales because it has been “operating the business at a loss.” The developer explains that “This model will enable Epic to cover the costs of servicing the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem. The funds that don’t go back to creators contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses.”</p><div><p>Today’s announcement is just the latest in a string of updates meant to expand <em>Fortnite</em> from a single, massively popular shooter to a platform for games, much like Roblox. Things really kicked off at the end of 2023 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">the launch of Epic-made games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em> and <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>, and since then the developer has added new creators tools like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">the ability to make first-person shooters</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader">the introduction of AI characters</a>.</p></div><p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">Epic said that it had paid out $352 million to creators in 2024</a>, with user-made games accounting for more than 36 percent of time spent in <em>Fortnite</em>. Today the company said that it had paid out a total of $722 million to date.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-still-manages-to-be-a-great-kart-racer-in-the-face-of-crossover-slop.1301379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mario-kart-preview-shadow-2000620065"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, the latest entry in the blue blur’s kart racing spin-off series, has a core conceit that Sonic, his friends, and his enemies are racing through portals to other tracks, and they might not always be in their own universe when they reach the other side. I’ve been enjoying my time with </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>a whole lot, but I’ve only been playing as my favorite boy, Shadow the Hedgehog, and even after I unlock crossover characters like Hatsune Miku, SpongeBob SquarePants, and </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s Joker, I still won’t stray far from the hedgehog I showed up for. Though I haven’t gotten to put much time into online play during the review period, I played a fair bit of it during the beta and had a blast with its fast-paced but strategic racing. I just wish </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> wasn’t also the latest example of corporate IP consolidation, when </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>’s signature, stylish flair more than carries it past the finish line.</span></p> <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has certainly exacerbated my crossover fatigue, but even though it has become the quintessential example of a video game dumping every IP its owners can afford into one big pot of sludge, my distaste for the act of tossing a bunch of unrelated characters and references into one game definitely predates Epic’s battle royale. I was annoyed when the fighting game </span><i><span>Injustice 2 </span></i><span>incorporated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles while concept art for the warlock Constantine was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/INJUSTICE/comments/kyevbw/official_injustice_2_concept_art_for_constantine/"><span>gathering dust on a NetherRealm Studios server</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale </span></i><span>was packed with playable ads for upcoming games in its line-up, while major players in PlayStation history were nowhere to be seen. That’s really all the influx of crossovers is these days: ads; cynical reminders that the things we like aren’t so divided as they once were. Where once we might occasionally see Freddy and Jason fight or Timmy Turner and Jimmy Neutron trade lives, now we get a lot of cosmetics that are low-effort references to other worlds, all thrown together without rhyme or reason and almost always featuring nods to other IPs that you can also go spend money on.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000626585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626585"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626585">© Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i><span> is stuffed with guest characters and crossover tracks, and it doesn’t escape my notice that almost every crossover here involves either a Sega or Paramount property. Unlike the core </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, these racers don’t have voice actors to spout any pre-race rival banter or make any sorts of exclamations when they do sick tricks or get pummeled by a competing racer’s rocket-powered boxing glove. In other words, these crossover characters are mostly just props placed in karts or on hoverboards to remind you that there are games or television shows you could be consuming other than the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>game you’re currently playing.</span></p>

 <p><span>The shame of all these efforts to remind people that other games exist is that when you cut through all the distraction, you find that </span><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </span></i><span>is an absolutely delightful and deep kart racer that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-trailer-mario-kart-world-nintendo-sega-rivarlry-2000626017"><span>outpaces some of its contemporaries</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>is at its best when it’s leaning into its own legacy, rather than gesturing at others. Its pre-race rival exchanges when you’re playing single-player modes and are pitted against a skilled, intelligent PC racer have some of the best one-on-one interactions much of its large roster has ever had in the series’ long history. Meanwhile, its race tracks pull from decades of </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>games past, and feel like a grand tour through different eras of the franchise with some banger tunes to accompany them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part of me got a bit sentimental racing around as Shadow and seeing several homages to him specifically, such as tracks based on Radical Highway, his iconic first level from </span><i><span>Sonic Adventure 2</span></i><span>, and one based on his version of the White Space from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><i><span>Shadow Generations</span></i></a><span>. It’s like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851"><span>Year of Shadow</span></a><span> never ended. Riding my sick, decked-out hoverboard on these stages was an absolute joy, until I saw motherfucking Hatsune Miku or Joker pull up next to me. Thus far, none of </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ announced DLC characters are from </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>games, TV, or movies, and as I see characters like Pac-Man and Steve coming down the pipeline, I’m left wondering where some more niche </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters are, like Infinite from </span><i><span>Sonic Forces </span></i><span>or, to really swing for the fences, someone like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-human-characters-tom-maddy-agent-stone-1851745037"><span>Agent Stone from the live-action movies</span></a><span>. Do you know how cool it would be to have one of the best characters to come out of those movies show up in a multiverse game? There’s already so much fan art of him in the games’ style, Sega. Skip the Ninja Turtles and get Lee Majdoub in the booth.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000626586" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626586"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626586">© Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to spend this entire write-up dunking on the crossover nonsense because when I get past that, </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> is a truly exhilarating, challenging, and complex racer that deserves a lot of credit for its systems. Though it is a bit faster than, and not as weighty as, something like </span><i><span>Mario Kart</span></i><span>, its Gadget mechanic, which lets you customize your vehicles with different perks, is a real game-changer. My go-to kit is one that gives me a Monster Truck item at the start of the race, so I can crush half the racers under a giant wheel, then another perk that gives me a boost every time I collide with an enemy, meaning that no one can knock me off the track and into the abyss; instead, if they try, they just end up slingshotting me forward as I leave them in the dust. Choice is at the heart of </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ racing systems, whether you’re choosing between a kart and a hoverboard or tweaking your gadgets to personalize your playstyle.</span></p> <p><span>Those ideas are what elevate </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>to one of </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>’s best spin-offs in recent memory. The game is best when it’s focusing on being an extremely fun </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racer, rather than a billboard for other games and TV shows. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Gloomy Eyes (Switch) - If Captain Toad Were A Cosy Horror Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/gloomy-eyes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-gloomy-eyes-switch-if-captain-toad-were-a-cosy-horror-game.1301331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Growing up, I absolutely loved <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/medievil">MediEvil</a> on the PS1. The spooky yet lighthearted aesthetic really spoke to me as a child and would ultimately help foster a lifelong passion for the horror genre. So when I saw trailers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gloomy_eyes">Gloomy Eyes</a> from developer Fishing Cactus, I was instantly enamoured with the Tim Burton-esque vibes.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Inside</a>, Gloomy Eyes is a puzzle-adventure that stars two characters, Nena and Gloomy, who begin an unlikely friendship. Described as "self co-op", the game is strictly single-player, but you’ll be swapping between the two protagonists on the fly in an effort to complete each level, while voiced narration provides context and backstory.</p>
<p>The levels themselves are presented as spooky dioramas, and a quick press of ‘-’ will bring the camera all the way out so you can scope out the entire environment. It reminds me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, in a way, albeit with much larger levels and puzzles that often require a bit of backtracking. That’s a scary word for many, but each level here takes mere minutes to complete, even if you have to spend time traipsing around in confusion before figuring out what to do. It’s a breezy experience, one that can easily be polished off in just a few short hours.</p>
<p>Puzzles are pretty tactile in the sense that you're always interacting directly with the environment with objects found on the fly, and you’re often required to complete objectives with one character to open access for the other. Gloomy, for example, can’t stand the light, so you might need to shut off the power as Nena. Alternatively, Gloomy is adept at chucking rocks, so hurling one at certain lights knocks them in the other direction, freeing the way to proceed while blinding an enemy stalking Nena.</p>
<p>Exploring the environment, picking up items, and discovering how they interact with obstacles is satisfying, but it can often be quite tricky to make out certain details within the world. This is usually due to two key reasons: the fixed camera angle makes depth perception difficult, so you’re never quite sure whether certain pathways are actually accessible until you start venturing down them; and the game just looks a bit messy on the Switch.</p>
<p>The art design is wonderful, but the slightly blurry visuals and washed-out colours can look unpleasant at times. It’s a shame, because it looks a real treat on other platforms, so this is yet another instance of Switch players getting an objectively lesser experience. It doesn’t look much better on Switch 2 either, but it’s at least fully functional if you want to try it on Nintendo’s newer system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, disappointing visuals aside, there’s a lot to like here. It definitely falls into the ‘cosy horror’ sub-genre, with spooky yet charming aesthetics, haunting music, and engaging puzzle-solving throughout. With Halloween on the horizon, it could be the perfect little primer for younger gamers.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/gloomy-eyes]]></content:encoded>

Valve will continue to support 64-bit versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 with Steam, but <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00">on January 1st 2026</a> it’s game over for 32-bit versions of Windows.</p><p>Windows 10 is the only 32-bit version of Windows that’s still currently supported by Steam. Microsoft is about to end of support for Windows 10 next month, but Valve will continue to support 64-bit versions of the OS. You’ll also still be able to play 32-bit games through Steam, just not install the Steam app on a 32-bit version of Windows.</p><p>The irony here is that the current version of Steam is a 32-bit app on all versions of Windows right now, but that appears to be changing soon. “Future versions of Steam will run on 64-bit versions of Windows only,” warns Valve in a support note. “This change is required as core features in Steam rely on system drivers and other libraries that are not supported on 32-bit versions of Windows.”</p><p>The move away from 32-bit versions of Windows won’t affect too many Steam users, though. Valve says the 32-bit version of Windows 10 is only used by 0.01 percent of all systems reported through its Steam Hardware Survey.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780806/valve-steam-32-bit-windows-support-end#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/780806/valve-steam-32-bit-windows-support-end]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">These are going to sell out fast.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the build-up to the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-october-2025-dates-announced">big Amazon Prime exclusive sale</a> (Prime Big Deal Days, or October Prime Day, as it's better known) well underway, we're already starting to see some notable early discounts that you should <em>absolutely</em> consider snapping up ASAP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That now includes a handful of new Nintendo Switch 2 games down to record low prices at Amazon, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/911rNx?object_uuid=824ca160-3573-4745-a58d-92076ec50881&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza, down to $53.54</a> (previously $69.99). Other discounted games include Cyberpunk 2077, Mario Kart World, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Breath of the Wild, with the additional discount automatically applied during checkout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's the catch? These are technically sold under <strong>Amazon Resale</strong>. Now hold your eye rolls, as we've seen deals like this before, and these discounts are some of the IGN Deals team's most anticipated offers going into the biggest sale period of the year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of what I'm recommending in the sale is classified as "Used - Like New," essentially what Amazon deems almost brand new, never used, with small damage to the packaging, but not to the contents themselves. So you're not losing anything, or buying a game that looks like it's been recently run over repeatedly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also already noted some PlayStation deals at Amazon Resale, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-deal-amazon-resale">PS Portal dropping to around $140</a> (but now sold out), and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-dualsense-edge-controller-deal-amazon-resale">DualSense Edge controller</a>, also down to around $140 right now (also likely to sell out soon). In case you hadn't already realised, the main with kind of deals is stock tends to be extremely limited, so be fast to the trigger if you don't want the disappointment of missing out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the best ways to buy into some of the most expensive new games available, and find rare discounts where you normally wouldn't (I'm looking at you, Nintendo). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, you still get the 30-day Amazon return policy, so it's still a much safer option than just buying a used game off some random on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, if you're looking for more Switch 2 game deals, we also recently covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-on-sale-at-amazon-including-discounts-on-sonic-and-more">discounts on other games sold by Amazon this week</a> (not resale either), including Split Fiction, Sonic x Shadow Generations, Madden NFL 26, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

It was "startling," Tencent said, that Sony was now attempting to claim Horizon's concept was original, rather than an idea based on "ubiquitous genre ingredients."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon — like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Far Cry: Primal, Far Cry: New Dawn, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more — Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions," Tencent wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's claim that Horizon was an original PlayStation concept was also "flatly contradicted" by remarks made in a behind-the-scenes documentary by Van Beek, Tencent stated, claiming that Guerrilla had briefly shelved work on Horizon Zero Dawn due to internal concerns it shared too many similarities with Enslaved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Light of Motiram Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game," Tencent argued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mr. Van Beek warned, 'I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points,' referring to prominent elements of Enslaved. Sony shelved the project — only to revive it later with full awareness that the idea was far from novel. When Horizon Zero Dawn finally launched in 2017, the gaming community noted its striking resemblance to Enslaved and other genre staples."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent's rebuttal attempts to dismiss other elements of Sony's lawsuit, too, by stating that its work on Light of Motiram was unconnected to a failed pitch meeting with Sony for a Horizon spin-off. Tencent has also claimed that Sony's entire lawsuit is invalid because the company had named the wrong parts of Tencent in its initial complaint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while attempting to defend itself from Sony's legal action, it is notable that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tencent-quietly-changes-light-of-motirams-steam-page-assets-following-horizon-sony-lawsuit">Tencent has also seemingly made adjustments to the work-in-progress Light of Motiram itself</a>. A glance at the game's Steam page shows it has been scrubbed of screenshots and logos that depicted its redheaded star and those robot dinosaurs. The suggestion here is that Tencent plans to ultimately release Light of Motiram without the elements Sony has deemed most similar to Horizon. It'll be interesting to see how Sony responds to these apparent alterations when it issues its rebuttal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Team Cherry's long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> has spawned lengthy discourse around difficulty in games, and now the developers have addressed the topic too.</p>
<p>The game is part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Game%20Worlds%20exhibition%20at%20Australia's%20national%20museum%20of%20screen%20culture%20(ACMI)">Game Worlds exhibition</a> at Australia's national museum of screen culture (ACMI), which was attended by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>. The exhibition's co-curator Jini Maxwell spoke with Ari Gibson and William Pellen from Team Cherry at the event.</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson explained. "So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes."</p>

<p>While Gibson admitted Silksong "has some moments of steep difficulty", he added "part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you're going and what you're doing."</p>
<p>So instead of players repeatedly attempting a particular boss fight, they "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>Gibson further noted that as Hornet is "inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight" of the first game, even base level enemies had to be "more complicated, more intelligent".</p>
<p>Added Pellen: "The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss. The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight's enemies, Hornet's enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away."</p>
<p>Team Cherry's approach was therefore to "bring everyone else up to match [Hornet's] level".</p>
<p>One other area of contention are the boss runbacks, which often task players with repeating difficult platform sections before re-attempting a boss. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day">have boss runbacks had their day?</a></p>
<p>"Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Silksong review</a>.</p>

			<p>The Complete RT shader and a selection of other visual improvements make Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater look stunning, making its visual more realistic and its lighting closer to path tracing quality.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, known modder <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer">MassiHancer</a> showcased the remake of the third entry in the series by KONAMI released last month on PC and consoles running with the Complete RT shader and ReSTIR G.I., which deliver path tracing quality with enhanced global illumination, ambient occlusion, tessellation, color grading and depth of field. The video also includes a few comparisons that highlight the significant improvements introduced to the game by the shader over the game's native Lumen.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although the game suffers from performance and stability issues that are being addressed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">post-launch updates</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a solid remake of one of the best entries in the series created by Hideo Kojima. The faithful recreation of what is, still today, one of the finest stealth games ever released, and the addition of Legacy Style for purists and New Style for newcomers makes this remake a solid purchase for all sorts of players, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/"> review.</a></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/774447/upgrade-downtime-indie-games-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seven-indie-games-that-will-upgrade-your-downtime-this-fall.1301289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We all know there’s a lot of tech to potentially upgrade in your life, but for those who want to upgrade their downtime with inexpensive, relatively short video games, I have good news. 2025 has already featured a wealth of excellent titles to spend your time with, including ones from smaller and independent developers that you can complete in a few sessions. If you’re looking for a good new game to play (and aren’t already deep into <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769489/hollow-knight-silksong-news-updates">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></em>), here are some great options from this year.</p><p>This new take on the classic side-scrolling versions of <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> from Dotemu and The Game Kitchen has gorgeous pixel art, tight platforming, thrilling combat, and a soundtrack that feels ripped straight from a cheesy action movie. The game can be pretty tough, which is fitting given its lineage, but there are Assist Mode features for those who want to make things a bit easier. It hits all the right notes for a great retro action game, yet it still feels very modern.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Poti Poti Studio / Wholesome Games Presents</cite></p></div><p>If a chill puzzle game is more of what you’re hankering for, <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> should fit the bill. In the game, you’re tasked with finding the right seats for adorable little shape people while taking into account their various needs. Some may request to sit near a window, or to be far away from a stinky person. It’s all very relaxing and charming, and there’s no time limit or major penalty for not seating everyone exactly as they want. When you do find the right seats for everyone, it’s extremely satisfying.</p><p><em>The Drifter</em> has all the hallmarks of an old-school point-and-click adventure game, like beautiful pixel art, many interesting people to talk to, and lots of items to experiment with. But unlike goofier stalwarts, such as the <em>Monkey Island</em> series, <em>The Drifter</em> uses the genre to tell a gripping thriller story. It’s a refreshing take on a classic genre, and like a great novel, I couldn’t put it down.</p><p><em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em> is a <em>Guitar Hero</em>-like music game that’s <em>packed</em> with excellent original music, including some catchy remixes of tunes from the hit roguelike <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>. I was a huge fan of <em>Rift</em>’s story mode, which uses a lightweight narrative to introduce you to the more than 30 songs in the game. There are also silly rhythm-based minigames and epic bosses. It’s foot-tapping fun, and if you’re like me, you’ll be humming the songs long after you put the game down.</p><p>Toby Fox’s parallel story to the indie classic <em>Undertale</em> has been in development for years and still isn’t finished. But even with four of seven planned chapters available to play right now, it feels like a complete experience. <em>Deltarune</em> is packed with just as much humor and oddities as <em>Undertale</em>, and the battles that blend RPG and bullet hell mechanics are just as entertaining to figure out in the in-development game. <em>Deltarune</em> is the longest game on this list — it took me about 15 hours to get through all four chapters that are out now — but every minute is worth your time.</p><p><em>Despelote</em>, set in Ecuador in 2001, puts you in the shoes of a soccer-obsessed kid who’s swept up in the excitement of Ecuador competing to qualify for the World Cup. It features a stunning art style that puts black-and-white characters in an oversaturated world, and according to my colleague Andrew Webster, you can finish the game in about two hours. He called it a “picture-perfect portrait of childhood obsession,” so if you’re looking for a game that might make you feel a bit nostalgic — even if you didn’t grow up being into soccer — this might be one to check out.</p><p>Sometimes, you just want a game that encourages you to turn off part of your brain, and <em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em> can do just that. The game gives you basic tools that you can level up to dig, dig, dig your way down. There isn’t some late-game twist that breaks the fourth wall. You dig a hole, monitor your remaining health and power levels, mine valuable treasures, and reemerge to upgrade your gear so you can go even deeper. It’s mesmerizingly simple, and a good game to check out if you’re exhausted by games with upgrade trees and endless quests.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/774447/upgrade-downtime-indie-games-2025#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/774447/upgrade-downtime-indie-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta Connect 2025 to show off the corporation’s latest non-AI. The tool, designed to spy on the objects in your home and send that data back to Facebook for advertising reasons…wait, sorry, I mean to answer questions while responding to your current environment, was asked to help Mark’s pretend-friend Jack Mancuso create a new sauce for his sandwich. Even in the heavily rehearsed and pre-scripted demonstration, the AI immediately shit the bed, leaving Mancuso and Zuckerberg to spuriously blame the wifi for the obvious technological fail.</p> <p>The AI being hyped right now is not AI at all. It’s really important that we all acknowledge this, that the world is selling itself a multi-billion dollar lemon, predictive text engines that have nothing intelligent about them. They’re giant sorting machines, which is why they’re so good at identifying patterns in scientific research, and could genuinely advance medicine in wonderful ways. But what they cannot do is&nbsp;<em>think</em>, and as such, it’s a collective mass-delusion that these systems have any use in our day-to-day lives beyond plagiarism.</p> <p>Here’s the set-up. Jack “Chef Cuso” Mancuso (the not-chef YouTuber and seller of knives and seasonings) is stood on camera in a kitchen set, before a table of ingredients capable of being put together for pretty much one purpose. Zuckerberg fake-ass pretends to think up an idea on the spot for what could be cooked up, “Maybe a steak sauce, maybe a Korean-inspired thing?”</p>

 <p>“Yeah, let’s try it. It’s not something I’ve made before,” says Mancuso, remembering his script, “so I could definitely use the help.”</p> <p>In the best case scenario for this Meta Connect demo, the Meta “AI” would scan the table of ingredients in front of Mancuso, and suggest a sauce he could make from the items it recognizes. The hilariously clearly-labeled bottles of “Sesame Oil” and “Soy Sauce,” with the words squarely facing the camera, sit next to—oh my goodness, would you look at that—a jar of Cuso-branded seasoning! There’s also some spring onions, a couple of lemons, two garlic cloves, salt and pepper and maybe a potato and a bottle of honey? It’s all next to a very sad-looking steak sandwich. So, Meta AI, what can we&nbsp;<em>possibly</em> do?</p>

 <p>“Hey Meta, start Live AI,” says Mancuso, just like in rehearsal, before a very long and awkward pause. “Starting Live AI” the robot voice eventually intones, before adding the unimprovable words, “I love this set-up you have here, with soy sauce and other ingredients.” Thanks! It loves it! That’s so thoughtful and demonstrative that it was able to scan the words in the image. “How can I help?”</p> <p>“Hey, could you help me make a Korean-inspired steak sauce for my steak sandwich here?” asks Mancuso, stood in front of the exact ingredients used to make Korean steak sauce <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-korean-bbq-marinade-recipes-from-the-kitchn-172750">according to this online recipe</a>. Oh, except for a pear. That recipe I just found wants a pear. He doesn’t have a pear. Interesting.</p>

 <p>“You can make a Korean-inspired steak sauce using soy sauce, sesame oil…” beings Meta AI, before Mancuso interrupts to stop the voice listing everything that happens to be there. “What do I do first?” he demands. Meta AI, clearly unimpressed by being cut off, falls silent. “What do I do first?” Mancuso asks again, fear entering his voice. And then the magic happens.</p>   <p>“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce.”</p>

 <p>Mancuso looks like a rabbit looking into the lights of an oncoming juggernaut. He now only has panic. There’s nothing else for it, there’s only one option left. He repeats his line from the script for the third time.</p> <p>“What do I do first?”</p> <p>There’s then audience laughter.</p> <p>“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce.”</p>

 <p>Mancuso seems to snap out of his stupor and makes the hilariously silly claim, “Alright, I think the wifi might be messed up. Sorry, back to you Mark.”</p> <p>There’s louder audience laughter.</p> <p>“It’s all good!” says Zuck, as he hears billions of dollars flushing down a toilet. “It’s a…the irony of the whole thing is you spend years making technology and then the wifi at the, er, day kinda…catches you.”</p>

 <p>Yeah, the wifi. You know how a bad wifi connection causes an AI to skip steps in a recipe. We’ve all been there. Same reason I lost that game of pool—the damn wifi in the bar.</p> <p>Rather than because of wifi, the reason this happened is because these so-called AIs are just regurgitating information that has been parsed from scanning the internet. It will have been trained on recipes written by professional chefs, home cooks and cookery sites, then combined this information to create something that sounds a lot like a recipe for a Korean sauce. But it, not being an intelligence, doesn’t know what Korean sauce is, nor what recipes are, because it doesn’t&nbsp;<em>know</em> anything. So it is that it can only make noises that sound like the way real humans have described things. Hence it having no way of knowing that ingredients haven’t already been mixed—just the ability to mimic recipe-like noises. The recipes it will have been trained on will say “after you’ve combined the ingredients…” so it does too.</p>

 <p>What’s so joyous about this particular incident isn’t just that it happened live on stage with one of the world’s richest men made to look a complete fool in front of the mocking laughter of the most non-hostile audience imaginable… Oh wait, it largely is that. That’s very joyous. But it’s also that it was so ludicrously over-prepared, faked to such a degree to try to eliminate all possibilities for error, and even so it&nbsp;<em>still</em> went so spectacularly badly.</p> <p>From Zuckers pretending to make up, “Oh, I dunno, picking from every possible foodstuff in the entire universe, what about a…ooh! Korean-inspired steak sauce!” for a man stood in front of the base ingredients of a Korean-inspired steak sauce, to the hilarious fake labels with their bold Arial font facing the camera, it was all clearly intended to force things to go as smoothly as possible. We were all supposed to be wowed that this AI could recognize the ingredients (it imagined a pear) and combine them into the exact sauce they wanted! But it couldn’t. And if it had, it wouldn’t have known the correct proportions, because it would have scanned dozens and dozens of recipes designed to make different volumes of sauce, with contradictory ingredients (the lack of both gochujang&nbsp;<em>and</em> rice wine vinegar, presumably to try to make it even simpler, seems likely to not have helped), and just approximated based on averages. Plagiarism on this scale leads to a soupy slop.</p> <p>You know what <del>Chef</del> Cuso could have done? He could have Googled a recipe, and visited a trusted site. Or, and sorry to be quite so old-fashioned, looked in a recipe book! Hell, he could have looked up instructions on Facebook.</p> <p>Oh, and here’s Jack Mancuso making a Korean-inspired steak sauce in 2023.</p>

            <p>Epic will soon allow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developers to sell in-game items from their Fortnite islands, allowing creators to make more money.</p>
<p>This will begin in December 2025, and for the first year developers will earn 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales - usually this is at 50 percent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-getting-a-major-new-sandbox-mode-separate-from-battle-royale">Fortnite's Creative Mode first launched back in 2018</a>, and allows players to create their own maps and modes. Epic then offers a payout based on engagement - <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">last year</a> it paid out $325m to creators, with seven receiving over $10m.</p>
<p>Since Creative Mode's release, Epic has revealed, players have spent over 11.2bn hours across 260,000 creator-made islands, resulting in $722,000,000 paid to creators.</p>
<p>The amount of money creators will make in Fortnite is only going to increase when they're able to sell in-game items directly from their islands, in addition to receiving an engagement payout from Fortnite's item shop sales.</p>
<p>Epic has a formula for calculating the V-Bucks value in US dollars each month, which takes all real-money spending towards V-Bucks (in dollars), subtracting platform and store fees, and dividing by total V-Bucks spent. With creators usually earning 50 percent of V-Bucks value from sales, this equates to 37 percent of retail spending. Roblox offers 25 percent, by way of comparison.</p>
<p>In addition, Epic will add a Sponsored Row to Fortnite's Discover, meaning creators can pay for increased visibility by bidding for placement in the row. That's a further investment in generating more in-game sales.</p>
<p>Epic has also announced Fortnite Creator Communities, to allow creators to share updates directly with players on the web and within Fortnite. Creator posts will be text and image-based and allow for sharing information and gathering feedback - much like on Steam.</p>

</figure>
<p>But despite the huge success of creator islands, is this really what Fortnite players want?</p>
<p>Take Steal A Brainrot. It's proven to be a phenomenal success - as <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/steal-a-brainrot-smashes-records-with-nearly-24-million-players-across-roblox-and-fortnite-3250973/">Dexerto</a> reported, it had 24 million players in a single day across both Roblox and Fortnite versions. While the Roblox version peaked at 23.4 million players in a day, Fortnite's version contributed 542,000. That vastly outweighs Fortnite's primary Battle Royale modes that generate around 100,000 players during peak weekend play.</p><p>"They are promoting AI slop, copy and paste creative maps more than their own BR season," wrote one player on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1n4fbrt/this_is_very_much_so_alarming_and_needs_to_be/">reddit</a>. "This is going to prove to be extremely unhealthy for the game in general I believe, and with the already low player counts this season Epic needs to do something to steer back to the basics, this metaverse stuff has RUINED Fortnite. This game has become a corporate shell of what it once was and I believe the remainder of this year will very much so make or break Fortnite as a whole."</p>
<p>"Stuff like this cluttering the overview makes me disinterested in random creative maps. Those who put genuine effort into their maps often get hardly any attention," wrote a user on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/">separate reddit post</a>. Others point to the casual nature of user-made maps, as well as the high XP offered, as reasons for players to flock over.</p>
<p>Still, this new update for Fortnite creators is further shifting the game away from its Battle Royale roots into a Roblox-rivalling metaverse.</p>

<figure><a title="baroque YA collection announcement" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85f54e2137f79/baroque-ya-collection-announcement.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sting</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japanese dev outfit Sting has just announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/baroque_ya">Baroque YA</a>, a collection of four games from the genre-spanning series, will release on Switch (in Japan only, for now) on <strong>18th December</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally released for the Sega Saturn all the way back in the Spice Girls-heady days of 1998, the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/baroque">Baroque</a> is a post-apocalyptic RPG in the roguelike vein that was eventually ported to Wii in 2008.</p>
<p>The game was then followed by a smattering of further entries, all of which are included in this new release, jumping genres from visual novel to platformer and shoot 'em up.</p>
<p>Here's the complete list of what's made the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BAROQUE: Original Version</strong></li>
<li><strong>BAROQUE Syndrome</strong></li>
<li><strong>BAROQUE Shooting: Reversed</strong></li>
<li><strong>BAROQUE ~Become a Meta-Being~ Revive</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, at some point we'll see this collection make it over to the West. But for now the old tried and tested means of grabbing this from the Japan eShop (or importing from your purveyor of choice) will have to suffice for big fans who just can't hold out. We'll keep you posted with any further news.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is reportedly the next Xbox exclusive to launch on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/383315/wiemy-jaki-kolejny-ex-microsoftu-trafi-na-ps5-co-z-pudelkami-oblivion-remastered.html">PPE</a> revealed that the latest entry in the Microsoft series will make its debut on PlayStation 5 sometime this November. No other information about this new edition of the game has been revealed besides the fact that it will receive a retail release alongside the digital release on the PlayStation Network.</p>



<p>Although its PlayStation 5 release has yet to be confirmed, there's a good chance that PPE's report is correct, as Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been repeatedly mentioned by <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">reliable leakers</a> as one of the Xbox exclusives that will launch on other platforms before the end of the year, alongside other titles such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Starfield, whose PS5 debut is rumored to have<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/"> moved to 2026</a>. With the Tokyo Game Show right around the corner, there's a very good chance we won't have to wait too long to learn if the game is indeed launching on PlayStation 5 before the end of the year.</p>



<p>If Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on PlayStation 5 this year, it will be only the latest among many other former Xbox exclusives that have made the jump to the Sony current-generation system. Among them are Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Forza Horizon 5. The multiplatform strategy seems to be working out, as some of these former Xbox exclusives are doing great on Sony's consoles, so much so that<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"> Forza Horizon 5 is currently the best-selling 2025 PS5 game to </a>, an impressive feat to accomplish for a game already available on other platforms.</p>

            <p>Dark Math Games, one of the multiple studios staffed by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developers to pop up and announce a very Disco Elysiumy RPG last year, have given their game a revamp. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a> is now called Tangerine Antarctic, with the switch also bringing a shift from isometric perspective to third-person.</p>
<p>If you missed the recent flourishing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-playable-disco-elysium-2-prototype-in-the-wilds-according-to-a-report-on-clashes-between-the-spiritual-successors">Disco spiritual successors</a> created by ex-ZA/UMers, the others include Longdue's RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">Hopetown</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">Summer Eternal</a>'s mystery project. Meanwhile, Disco writer Robert Kurvitz and artist Aleksander Rostov are making something for a studio called Red Info, and ZA/UM themselves are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zero-parades-looks-to-be-the-new-name-of-zaums-post-disco-elysium-spy-crpg-not-that-its-reveal-paraded-that-aroundre">working on a new CRPG called Zero Parades</a>. It's all very easy to keep track of.</p>

<p>According to Dark Math Games founder Timo Albert, the pitch for Tangerine Antarctic is as follows: "Set at the World’s End ski village at Mount Hope, British Antartica, Tangerine Antarctic is the name of the in-game hotel, designed by renown Estonian architect Kaur Stőőr, where most of the games’ action takes place. This is where you are stuck because of the blizzard and must solve the mysterious murders. And Tangerine Antarctic is one of the important characters of this true detective's RPG."</p><p>The switch from isometric to third person could be construed as an effort to distance the game from the 'Disco Elysium successor' label that's been applied with various degrees of cynicism to all of the projects I mentioned earlier. However, as you can see from the freshly posted peek at a bit of Tangerine Antarctic's dialogue above, it still very much looks like someone's reinterpreted Disco's homework.</p>
<p>Dark Math's revamped Steam page for the game promises "deep single-player role-playing with seismic choices" and a "unique companion dynamic" that helps you solve those murders. The devs write that your "choices, substances, and experiences" will all "affect how you hear and feel the world". It also boasts a "Dopamine Buffet", which is described thusly: "Rehearse your moves. Dance through crime scenes. Drift through parties. Or find pleasure in completing the simplest chores. Get better with every action you take."</p>
<p>So, you're like Hercule Poirot with the ability to do the macarena whenever someone snuffs it, and also the power to do some "Marafet calculations to alter your time and space". Sounds like it could be fun, but who knows with any of these games at this point.</p>
<p>Tangerine Antarctic doesn't have a release date, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/Tangerine_Antarctic/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has responded to Sony's Horizon lawsuit, claiming its action adventure game Light of Motiram uses "time-honoured" genre tropes.</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> claiming its newly-revealed game was a "slavish clone" of the Horizon games, owing to its red-headed heroine, post-apocalyptic world, and robotic enemies.</p>
<p>Tencent has now filed its response in a motion to dismiss, stating Sony "seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions" (thanks <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">The GamePost</a>). It reads as something of an attack against Guerrilla's games, stating Sony's claims of Horizon's originality are "startling".</p>

<p>"Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies - and ten unnamed defendants - about the unreleased video game Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony's game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and its spinoffs," said Tencent.</p>
<p>"At bottom, Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain."</p>
<p>Sony previously claimed Horizon Zero Dawn was "like no fictional world created before [or] since". In response, Tencent claimed this is "flatly contradicted" by Guerrilla itself, pointing to a behind-the-scenes documentary where art director Jan-Bart Van Beek admitted the game's central premise has been done before - specifically in 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.</p>
<p>"That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolise through this lawsuit," said Tencent.</p>
<p>"Sony's Complaint tellingly ignores these facts. Instead, it tries to transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets."</p>
<p>It continued: "By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honoured tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon - like Enslaved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, Far Cry: Primal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-new-dawn">Far Cry: New Dawn</a>, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more - Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</p>

<p>Tencent's response also addressed a meeting at GDC in March 2024 where Tencent representatives pitched a licensed Horizon mobile game that Sony ultimately turned down. The Chinese company stated no executives or employees were at the meeting, so nothing at the meeting "is alleged to be an act of copyright or trademark infringement".</p>
<p>What's more, Tencent has claimed Sony is attempting to sue the wrong company, so wants the case thrown out on legal grounds.</p>
<p>While Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, Light of Motiram - according to Tencent's response - is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, a developer operating under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent-games">Tencent Games</a>' and/or 'Level Infinite'".</p><p>"None of the served defendants develop and market the Light of Motiram video game that Sony alleges infringes its intellectual property in the Horizon franchise," said Tencent. It stated Tencent Holdings Ltd. is simply a parent company and has no involvement in Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>"Sony's threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue. Sony's vague allegations against 'Tencent' or 'Defendants' generally cannot substantiate the claims it brings against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., or Tencent Holdings specifically."</p>
<p>Lastly, Light of Motiram won't release until the end of 2027, meaning Sony's lawsuit is built on what the game "might" look like before it's even out, said Tencent.</p>
<p>Still, shortly after Sony began suing Tencent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">Light of Motiram's Steam page was quietly altered</a> to remove, edit, and/or replace key art, as well as rewrite the description.</p>
