			<p>The Steam publishing guidelines have been recently updated with a new clause that  prevents the release of certain types of content on the platform if they violet payment processors and banks rules.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/">Automaton</a>, the Rules and Guidelines section of the Steamworks Documentation has been recently updated with a new clause that prohibits the publication of "content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers." The clause clarifies that this refers to certain kinds of adult-only content, of which there's a lot on the Valve platform. A few hours ago, SteamDB confirmed that several games that are definitely in violation of this new rule have been removed from the store, although it's still unconfirmed if their removal has anything to do with the new publishing guidelines clause.</p>



<p>As payment processors and card networks have very strict rules regarding adult content, it was only a matter of time before adult content on Steam would be impacted. Hopefully, the clause will only impact content that's in clear violation of the rule and won't be used to further limit what can be published on Steam, regardless of the presence of what is deemed adult content by a third party.</p>



<p>Besides the addition of the new clause, the rest of the Steam publishing Rules and Guidelines haven't been changed. You can check them out by going <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">here.</a></p>

            <p>I liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and having read through the notes for its summer update, patch 1.5, I reckon I'll like it even more whenever I next decide to don <a href="https://www.vg247.com/becoming-avoweds-most-toxic-360-no-scoper">the persona of a trickshotting Envoy</a>.</p>
<p>This patch is the <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945182871930511524">second of three seasonal updates</a> Obsidian outlined that the game'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">over the course of this year</a>. It's brought a substantial rework of fighter and ranger skills, some extra unique weapons for you to get your mitts on, Steam Deck verification, plus a bunch of other tweaks and fixes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The changes to abilities on offer to non-magical scrappers form the meat of <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/">the patch's notes</a>, and Obsidian say they've been made "to round out the classes compared to the Wizard tree". Those damn wizards, always getting the fancy tricks.
</p>
<p>The new abilities added in include the likes of a Shadow Step skill for sneaky stealthers that'll let you casually "step into the Beyond, reappearing behind your enemy", with upgrades offering the chance to do stuff like ensure these killer backstabs reset the ability's cooldown.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update 1.5 is now live for Avowed! Please update your game when you see that this update is available to receive the following features, fixes, and changes: <a href="https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r">https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r</a></p><p>• Explore new weapons, abilities, and armor<br>• Korean and Japanese language support<br>• ✔️ Steam… <a href="https://t.co/6VEIccb1Ir">pic.twitter.com/6VEIccb1Ir</a></p></div>— Avowed (@AvowedtheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945181691800076625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Melee Maurices, on the other hand, get skills like reviving allies "from a great distance", a Barbaric Smash that lets you absorb an enemy's built up stun reserves if your "massive blow" kills them, and the ability to take a deep breath that immediately recovers all of their stamina. That last one's something I need in real life.</p>
<p>Alongside that, Obsidian have aimed to address folks "not able to play specific builds that they wanted to early on in the game" by littering a bunch of extra unique weapons throughout Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, Shatterscarp, and Galawain’s Tusks. The former two have gotten the most, with six and five items respectively, mirroring the goal to frontload some more fun.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, enemies have been given some player abilities "such as Returning Storm, Ring of Tire, Taunt, Clear Out, Blizzard, and Tanglefoot" as well as new physical and magical barriers to block attack. So they should be equipped to try and hold off your newfound skillage.</p>
<p>Add in the Steam Deck verification, some changes to the cooking and crafting interface, and a bunch of bug fixes. The result's a patch that looks to me like a decent excuse to dust off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-beginners-guide">your facial shrooms</a> if you fancy a fresh playthrough, even if it's unlikely to turn your view on Avowed around if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">the release version</a> wasn't up your alley.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the series, Frosthaven and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a> (which has been treated to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">excellent digital adaption</a>) are some of the most elephantine and absurdly lavish of the big box 'legacy' board games. The idea behind a legacy game is, instead of whipping it out for the odd isolated session, you play a full campaign. There's character progression with little bags to store your stuff in, stickers to put on the map to mark new locations you've discovered, and mystery boxes to be opened when the game tells you to. It feels like pure magic when pulled off by a board game, but you naturally lose some of that when everything's being done digitally. What's impressive with cards, tokens and stickers just becomes rote when performed by a computer.</p>
<p>Luckily, Gloomhaven and Frosthaven have clever and deep tactical combat that's worth engaging with for its own sake, alongside story events with choice and consequence. I haven't played the physical version of Frosthaven, but Gloomhaven was a biblical bollockcrusade to set up and tear down. I cannot promise you the PC version of Frosthaven will be good but, as with the Gloomhaven adaption, I can confidently say it will never require you to glue together an MDF token tray.</p>
<p>Where Frosthaven most differs from its prequel is in the town itself, where you'll construct and upgrade buildings to unlock more equipment and events. Some features from Steam, a digital storefront and therefore immune to the psychic damage caused by the following irresponsible abundance of capital letters:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>UNIQUE CHARACTERS</strong> - Choose from six starting character classes—including the Banner Spear, Boneshaper, Drifter, Geminate, Blinkblade, and Deathwalker</li>
<li>Additional classes will be unlocked as you progress your campaign</li>
<li>Each class features its own unique abilities and playstyle to master</li>
<li><strong>DEEP, TACTICAL COMBAT</strong> - Engage in deep, tactical turn-based combat, testing your skills against an array of new enemies and formidable bosses</li>
<li>Utilize an ability card system that requires careful planning to unleash devastating attacks, execute powerful combos, and try keeping your party members alive</li>
<li><strong>BUILD YOUR OUTPOST -</strong> Manage the Outpost, constructing and upgrading various buildings, unlocking new game features and mechanics</li>
<li><strong>A STUNNING WORLD TO EXPLORE</strong> – A stunning art style, highly detailed models and textures, and expressive animations all bring the world of Frosthaven to life.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>There's 130 quests in the full thing, and I'm assuming quests here means a full location with enemies, an objective, and likely a story event or two. There'll be "35+ quests across Acts 1 and 2" in the early access build at launch. You can also play with up to three mates. Another reason you might be interested in Frosthaven is if you're weary of 'brutish' fantasy races - Cephalofair hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-easy-being-green-a-brief-history-of-orcs-in-video-games">good orc opinion haver</a> James Mendez Hodes to help build on Frosthaven's world, and what I've seen seems much richer for it. His writings have been over-simplified over the years in some well-meaning but ultimately clumsy "orcs are black people" cultural criticisms, but it's <a href="https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror">great work</a> from a great writer who, like me, just bloody loves a good orc.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-fantasy-frosthaven-is-a-dm-free-dungeons-and-dragons-campaign-in-a-box-and-its-coming-to-steam-this-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We are straining Rock Paper Shotgun's innovative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-the-demo-for-this-magical-scandinavian-skiing-game-is-so-serene-then-why-do-i-die-constantly">"News To Me, Anyway"</a> subcategory to breaking point with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxic-depths-caves-of-the-yendori">Anoxic Depths: Caves Of The Yendori</a>, a turn-based spelunking roguelite from Studio Tectorum. The scurvy bean-counters among you might protest that it came out 10 years ago, possibly before some of you were old enough to read, operate video games, or count beans. To you scurvy bean-counters I would say: if you're going to be so picky about details, how about you help me remember which way is up, because I am stuck in an underwater cave.</p>
<p>I have maybe 12 breaths left in my oxygen cylinder, and all I can see is rock texture. The ladder to the surface could be a foot away or 20. Soon, my body shall join those of the divers who came before. Ye gods, I love being this confused in video games.</p><!--more-->
<p>Anoxic Depths offers "3D gameplay in a 2D world", to which the only appropriate response is surely "you magnificent bastards, get the hell in here and also, get the hell out, I never want to see your face again". It casts you as a diver fetching bones, pottery and amulets from procedurally generated underground lakes, at the request of a mysterious researcher.</p>
<p>The researcher "is not a cave diving instructor", <a href="https://www.studiotectorum.com/anoxic-depths/">the developer's official website cautions</a>, which is presumably why there is no tutorial in the demo, just sparse hints from NPCs in the shops and dwellings around the cavemouth. I would appreciate a tutorial, in that Anoxic Depths simulates "decompression sickness" and "pulmonary barotrauma", and I don't quite know what either of these are. But before I can get pulmonary barotrauma, I need to master the art of descending through a world that appears flat.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>, Anoxic Depths deals out its geography in cross-sections. Unlike in Dwarf Fortress, you can roll the view by 90 degree increments, turning a horizontal cross-section into a vertical one. There is no HUD indication of your orientation by default, so you have to really build up a mental map of the volume you're exploring, and count the number of times you've rolled. There are gear items such as diving lines to help you retrace your path to the surface. While we're talking gear, don't forget to switch on your breathing apparatus before you plunge in.</p>
<p>As and when you've got your head round these things, you can try playing the game with a kanji tileset or ASCII, if you want to really layer up the Dwarf Fortress comparisons. Are there any Dwarf Fortress-style procedural demons below? I've yet to encounter one and I sincerely hope not. Imagine trying to elude a Forgotten Beast when you can't remember which way is up.</p>
<p>Thanks to Resetera user Toma for <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/anoxic-depths-roguelike-kanji-scuba-diving-simulator-free-demo.1243713/">passing this on</a>. You can try the demo for yourself on <a href="https://studiotectorum.itch.io/anoxic-depths">Itch.io</a>. It limits how deep you can dive, but saves do carry over to the full game, which will set you back by around the price of a posh supermarket sandwich.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will amend the way trading works at the end of this month, following previous criticism of the feature.</p>
<p>Trading was added to the digital card game back in January, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">players quickly criticised the need for an extra currency</a>, calling the system "a joke". Then, back in March, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">acknowledged the backlash and announced an overhaul</a>.</p>
<p>Today, an in-game notification states an update will take place on 29th July. This will discontinue trade tokens and instead the existing shinedust will be used for trading. In addition, players will no longer need to consume cards in order to trade.</p>

<p>To compensate, the amount of shinedust acquired for duplicate cards will be doubled. Trade tokens will also be exchangeable in the shop for pack hourglasses and shinedust.</p>
<p>The exchange rate will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x pack hourglass = 1 x trade token (maximum 60 exchanges)</li>
<li>10 x shinedust = 1 x trade token (unlimited exchanges)</li>
<li>100 x shinedust = 10 x trade tokens (unlimited exchanges)</li>
<li>1000 x shinedust = 100 x trade tokens (unlimited exchanges)</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to this update, the trading function will be unavailable from 25th July 7am until 30th July 06:59 am.</p>
<p>Another addition will be a Wishlist feature, where players can indicate to others which cards they'd like to trade for. This will make trading for the right cards considerably easier.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The Pokémon Company previously stated these changes would arrive by the end of autumn 2025, so this update is arriving a lot sooner than expected.</p>
<p>The annual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Presents livestream will take place on 22nd July</a>, which was teased yesterday with a Pikachu at a set of DJ decks. Perhaps we'll receive an update to Pokémon TCG Pocket too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-finally-receives-much-needed-trading-overhaul]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate studio Super Evil Mega Corp, this spinoff of the sci-fi universe that Snyder kicked off in 2023 allows players to drop into the Rebel Moon universe with isometric, twin-stick shooter gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take on intense combat missions in this multiplayer action game,” an official description for Blood Line says. “Build a rebellion against the Motherworld and fight for your planet’s freedom.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With friends or alone, Blood Line tells a standalone story completely separate from the tale spun in Rebel Moon parts 1 and 2. What’s more is that Netflix Games and Super Evil Mega Corp <a href="https://www.rebelmoongame.com/features/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>promise</u></a> their video game spinoff will “expand and evolve across regular post-launch updates.” With more challenges and rewards yet to be revealed, Blood Line’s future seems much more secure than the film series it originates from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Moon: Part 1 – A Child of Fire set the stage for a new world from Snyder when it premiered in late 2023. After propping it up as a big-budget sci-fi epic with lots of moving parts, Rebel Moon Part 1 failed to impress, scoring a 22% from critics and 56% from fans on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_1_a_child_of_fire" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rotten Tomatoes</u></a> (we gave it a 4/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>our review</u></a>). Rebel Moon: Part 2 – The Scargiver attempted to get the new universe back on track upon its release in April 2024 but faced a similar landing with a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_two_the_scargiver" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>16% from critics and 47% from fans</u></a> (we also gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>a 4/10</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snyder Cut versions of both Rebel Moon films eventually made their way to Netflix in August 2024 and received <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_one_directors_cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>more positive reviews from audiences</u></a>, but Netflix has been quiet about how the story may continue. Snyder spoke about his work with Netflix during a recent interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/rebel-moon-video-game-zack-snyder-film-franchise-superman-1236453663/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a>. While Rebel Moon and its characters remain on the Man of Steel director’s mind, it sounds like he’s got other projects he’ll be tackling first.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got sidetracked into this — not sidetracked, it’s all uptown problems, as they say — for Netflix, I’m working on an LAPD SWAT movie,” Snyder said. “So I was like, OK, well, I’m gonna just sort of let that Rebel Moon world boil for a minute, and I’m gonna go do this. And frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it. I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break. So yeah, we’ll see after I finish this, when I come back, where we are with everything.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snyder adds that there are “tons of stories” to tell from the Rebel Moon, but he still needs to determine how the universe could expand, “if at all.” While we wait to see how Blood Line might continue to build on Snyder's world, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-star-says-negative-reviews-zack-snyder-movie-really-affected-her">how the negative reviews affected Rebel Moon star Sofia Boutella</a>.

<p>Arc System Works most recently revealed <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a></strong> - a new 4v4 fighting game which is backed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and will be releasing on the PlayStation 5 and PC next year. So, most of the focus is likely going to be on this game in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This rumour follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> on the Nintendo Switch at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, this particular platform is still waiting on DLC.

<p>As part of this, the official Pokémon social channels in Japan <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1945045929620349069">have also shared a new image (above)</a>. It shows Pikachu, who is apparently preparing something, and in front of the same Pokémon is what looks to be a DJ setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The "Pokémon Presents" to be streamed on Tuesday, July 22, will have its viewing page open from 9 PM on the same day. It seems like Pikachu is preparing something...? Stay tuned for more updates!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftswjnv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">From the creators of Rick &amp; Morty, with added talking guns </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your sense of humor I'd wager a giant pickle that you can't make it through an hour of playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> without at least a childish snigger. The Squanch Games shooter is back on Xbox Game Pass today, so there's really no excuse not to test out that theory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conceived in the brain of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/rick-morty">Rick &amp; Morty</a> creator Justin Roiland, it's a time honored tale of an alien invasion, bounty hunting missions, sentient weaponry, and a wannabe drummer called Globo who has a butt for a face. Roiland lends his vocal chords to your main gun, Kenny, who chats to you as you explore different planets and take on different enemies. It's essentially "what if Morty spat bullets and had something to say about every little move I made?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave High On Life game an 8 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-review">our review</a>, and called it "an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. " When it was first on Xbox Game Pass originally in 2022, it became the biggest Xbox Game Pass release of that year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">High on Life: Meet the Talking Guns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are what Kenny describes as "classic, text book, puzzle situations," or "simple platforming… like in Mario Land" parts, but the true joy comes from the inane dialogue and jokes that are hitting you from everywhere. The storyline takes weird tangents, henchmen hanging around in the background and chat, and your selection of talking weapons never shut up. One of them - my favorite, whose ammunition is the bodies of his newborn children - is even voiced by comedian Tim Robinson from I Think You Should Leave and A24's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/friendship">Friendship</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He'll say  typical line from Knifey might be "I'm in heaven right now, I'm ripping through his tendons like they're butter," or a dying Carebear type creature with its intestines hanging out will beg you to stay until it dies, then fake you out until Kenny begs you to shoot him. NPCs chat about killing their wives and kids so they won't miss them, or who  on the team might be into sexual torture. There's a section in an Applebees, a gun called Lezduit who talks like Sylvester Stallone, a kid who taunts you to kill him - "I look so shootable" while Kenny begs you not to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, just try it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> was just announced this summer and is supposed to be out by this winter, so you'll want to catch up with the story before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/maniacally-unhinged-shooter-high-on-life-hits-xbox-game-pass-again-today]]></content:encoded>

Under Sagat’s rule, a new stage called Proud Spire will be released as well, featuring a calming temple and a peaceful Buddha statue in the background.</p><p>Sagat’s regalia includes two Outfits—Outfit 1 is a newer look featuring a darker Muay Thai-inspired theme, while Outfit 2 is an ode to his <em>Street Fighter II</em> appearance where he dons Muay Thai shorts, plus hand and foot wraps which is common for many Muay Thai practitioners. Outfit 2 can be earned in World Tour by maxing out your bond with Sagat or purchased via Fighter Coins.</p><p>Year 3 Ultimate Pass and Year 3 Character Pass—both of which will unlock Sagat, the three remaining Year 3 characters, including C.

On Arrakis, that’s true. Between the sandworms and the other deadly players, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone or anything friendly. Even worse, your only haven—the base you build—isn’t free or safe. You owe money to the local government for plopping down a few foundations and creating a habitat. If you don’t pay, oh, they’ll take it from you by force, by god. Here’s everything to know about paying your taxes in <em>Dune Awakening</em> to avoid the Imperial government’s wrath! We can’t help you with paying your actual taxes though—but be sure to do that, too!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h547454"><a id=""></a>How to pay the tax man</h2><p>Initially, you’ll likely have to pay the Ornithopter Pilot at a local trade post for a ride to either Arrakeen or Harko Village.

This unfamiliar language is the Aeonian people's mother tongue, and during the early stages of being on their planet, you won't have any idea what they're saying.

The port will launch on July 17, but this early footage may be running the 2.3 update already, because fans have taken note of what might be an autopilot icon when V gets behind the wheel. <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>had a similar function when you rode your horse, allowing you to trot along to your destination without having to move your character yourself. If <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> got a similar feature, it would actually be a genuine improvement to the game because its cars handle like they’re hydroplaning. Motorcycles run well enough, though. However, sometimes the plot requires you to drive a car for races and high-speed chases, and that shit <em>sucked</em>. So if I can click in the left thumb stick and have the car drive itself, that would rock, actually.</p><p>While that’s all speculation, some details about the 2.3 update seem to have leaked. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span><em> </em>confirmed the patch will launch alongside the Mac version on Thursday, but also stated that it will include “additional cars and new photo mode features.” The cars I can take or leave, but I’m down for another set of photoshoots around <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">Night City</a></span>.
