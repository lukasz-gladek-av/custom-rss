            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-review" rel="nofollow"><em>High on Life</em></a> seemingly had one guiding question that fueled every design decision: What's the funniest thing we can do here? It's the kind of over-the-top, wildly left-field humor that's in line with <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, as you'd expect, and <em>High on Life 2</em> takes those ideas to new heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played it a few weeks ago at a Microsoft event during PAX West weekend, where we also chatted with Squanch Games COO Matty Studivan about this sequel that takes things to more radical places (in more ways than one).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>High on Life 2</em>, you must use your intergalactic hitman abilities to take down a sci-fi-comedy metaphor for big pharma. The talking weapons from the first game return, though some new ones have joined the fray. Most interestingly, however, is that you can't sprint in this game. Instead, you skate.</p>



<h2>High on Laughs</h2>

<p>If you played the first game or have watched <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, you'll know exactly what to expect with <em>High on Life 2 </em>in terms of its narrative and character moments. A prime example from the demo I played is when I was infiltrating an area to assassinate my target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the front door was guarded, so I had to sneak in through some other means. In most other games, you'd find that vent or elevator shaft and simply use it. Congratulations, you reached the next checkpoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>High on Life 2</em>, I just went slightly to the right and found an elevator being worked on by maintenance. I approached the worker, heard a little of his spiel, and then walked past him to get in the elevator, which immediately broke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From there, he asked if I could help him fix the elevator by hitting some buttons inside. At some point, he asks me to hold one button for 20 seconds, then while holding it, hit another button. Astute gamers might realize that there's only, in fact, one interact button.</p>

<p>So even if you follow the charade of counting to 20, you can't do it. And the worker says something that points out that you don't really have the capacity to hit two interact buttons.</p>



<p>In other words, it's meta comedy all the way down. That meta humor comes into play during a boss fight in the demo. I won't spoil it too much, but let's just say that it surpassed my expectations in terms of just how much Squanch Games is dedicated to obliterating the fourth wall. If this wouldn't risk legal trouble, I'm sure they would joke about deleting system32 to solve a puzzle.</p>

<p>Even the premise of <em>High on Life 2</em> lives on the line between absurd and ridiculous. My mission was to hunt down a fictional senator named Muppy Doo, who was giving a speech at a convention. So I had to go to the Convention Planet and go through Parking Con and Con Con (again, meta) to get to his convention. Of course, it was impossible to find parking at Parking Con.</p>



<h2>Love It or Skate It</h2>

<p>This kind of humor can be pretty polarizing; often it's either incredibly your thing or absolutely not your thing. Regardless, what's hard to deny is that the core gameplay itself is fun, amid all the jokes and jabs.</p>

<p>This first-person shooter feels more energetic and frantic than its prequel, and what really contributes to the frenetic pace is the new sprint mechanic. Instead of running, your character whips out a skateboard, immediately changing the trajectory of how you move.</p>

<p>It takes a bit to get used to just because it really does feel like riding a skateboard instead of sprinting in something like <em>Call of Duty</em>. Once you get the hang of it though, you can also leap onto walls and ride them for a bit. Rails can be grinded on, adding another option for cruising around an arena.</p>

<p>The talking weapons make a return here, as expected. They're arguably the heart and core of <em>High on Life</em>, providing both comedic relief and narrative advancement. Each has an alternate fire mode as well, which can doubly be used to solve certain puzzles in the environment.</p>

<p>The new weapon I found in the demo was a three-shot burst rifle named Sheath, and he's voiced by the buttery-brutal tones of Ralph Ineson. His alternate fire shoots out a giant spike, and you can chain it to multiple enemies to make them all collide into each other. It adds a nice amount of crowd control that comes in handy, especially when you get a little overwhelmed.</p>



<h2><em>High on Life 2</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, I think a lot of people interested in <em>High on Life 2 </em>already know exactly what they're signing up for. This is a comedy game first and foremost, which is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness. If you like quirky meta humor, you'll like this, but the equal and opposite is also true. At the very least, the tone seems consistent in the demo, and it will always stand out from the pack regarding all the first-person shooters out there.</p>

<p>Over the long term, I'm curious how well the narrative will land. Joking the entire time can potentially get old, and I personally ran out of steam partway through the first game. But with more exciting gameplay, maybe <em>High on Life 2</em> will have enough juice to keep things radical all the way to the end.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6’s</em> open beta</a> on PC and consoles quickly became one of the most-played games of 2025. But like any modern game hitting Xbox in 2025, <em>BF6</em> is launching on both the Series X and the weaker Series S. And according to the devs behind the game, getting <em>BF6</em> to run on the less powerful console was a “challenge.”</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ttk-shotgun-jumping-sliding-nerf-changes-open-beta-ea-patch-notes-2000619184"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I asked if the team struggled while trying to get such a big and complicated game to run well on Xbox Series S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006">We’ve heard stories</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-devs-xbox-series-s-x-performance-60fps-mode-1851674405">that the Series S</a> <a href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/">can cause devs headaches</a>. And despite Frostbite, <em>BF6</em>‘s engine, being very “scalable,” the Series S was still proven a tricky beast to conquer.</p> <p><span>“I will say that the biggest thing we did that was a challenge for us was [dealing with the console’s limited] memory,” explained Christian Buhl, technical director on <em>Battlefield 6.</em> “Xbox Series S does have less memory than even our mid-spec PC. And so there was a point…Oh, I want to say, like, 6 to 12 months ago where we kind of realized that a lot of our levels were crashing on Xbox Series S.”</span></p>

 <p>As a result, the team focused on “optimizing” memory usage in<em> Battlefield 6</em>. And these improvements weren’t just felt on Series S. According to Buhl, this process made the “whole game better and more stable.” However, the devs also worked on “specific optimizations” for Xbox Series S, too.</p> <p><span>“We were doing so much testing…we were collecting all this data,” explained Buhl. “Once we kind of started running all our levels through it, and were able to see where the problems were, after a month or two, we had kind of resolved all of our memory issues on Series S.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Buhl says <em>Battlefield 6</em> is now “super solid” and “performant” on Xbox Series S and will run at a “smooth 60 frames per second.” And <a href="https://youtu.be/m3nUC1dUFy8">footage of the game’s open beta running on Series S</a> seems to back that up.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>EA Won’t Talk About <em>Battlefield 6</em> On Switch 2</h2> <p>Of course, with Frostbite being so scalable and the studio working hard to make <em>BF6</em> super optimized, I wanted to ask if, theoretically, the game could run on a Switch 2. The studio is even i<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">mplementing gyro controls on PS5 and PS5 Pro</a> to let players flick around quickly or reload with the simple waggle of the gamepad.</p>

 <p>However, when I asked if it would be possible for <em>Battlefield 6</em> and Frostbite to run on a Switch 2 based on the specs, an EA rep stepped in and cut off Buhl right as he began to say something.</p> <p><span>“Sorry, I have to step in here,” said the EA rep. “We can’t talk anything beyond, sort of, like, the consoles that <em>Battlefield’s</em> coming to, which is Xbox Series X/S and PS5, and PS5 Pro.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Later on, when the team was talking about gyro controls, I brought up how the Switch 2 has excellent gyro sensors in its Joy-Con.</p>

 <p><span>“Exactly, yeah,” was the response. So, at least I can confirm the devs working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> think the Switch 2 has great <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaming-controllers-gyro-trackpad-scuf-mouse-keyboard-2000624503">gyro controls. </a>Beyond that, nothing.</span></p> <p>I’m very excited to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> once it launches on October 10 on my PS5 Pro and high-end gaming PC. But not everyone has access to those devices, and some players are gaming on the aging and weaker Xbox Series S. So I’m happy to hear that the devs behind the game worked so hard on optimizing it and making sure all platforms get a great version of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> And hey, maybe Switch 2 owners will get their own solid version of <em>BF6</em> in the future?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valor Mortis Preview – Bloodborne But Make It French]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/valor-mortis-preview-bloodborne-but-make-it-french</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valor-mortis-preview-%E2%80%93-bloodborne-but-make-it-french.1297170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Polish studio One More Level made a good name for itself with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghostrunner-2-review-run-ghost-run" rel="nofollow">the <em>Ghostrunner </em>franchise</a>, and now it's taking a stab at the ever-popular soulslike formula with its own twist. Enter <em>Valor Mortis</em>, which was revealed just weeks ago at Gamescom.</p>

<p>This upcoming game keeps the first-person perspective that One More Level is known for, but it swaps out the cyberpunk-ninja aesthetic for something a little more 19th century. You play as an English soldier in the French military (for story reasons), but there's some supernatural, bloodcurdling spooky stuff going on.</p>

<p>The combat feels intense and enjoyable, and the world presents this intriguing mystery that I want to learn more about when <em>Valor Mortis</em> releases in 2026.</p>



<h2>Shoot, Slice, Spark</h2>

<p>A majority of soulslikes, as you probably know, are in a third-person perspective, to account for the rapid movements of certain enemies and the endless dodge rolls you'll be doing. They can be frantic at times, so I was a little worried about how it'd feel in first person.</p>

<p><em>Valor Mortis</em>, however, threads the needle perfectly. Motions are clear, and I found a lot of clarity in the hitboxes between me and the enemies. Swinging the sword feels great, and the visual and audio feedback when you land a hit or parry is satisfying.</p>

<p>This game goes for the dual-wielding approach to combat, where your right hand is your sword while your left hand deals ranged attacks. I got a flintlock pistol early in the demo, but later, I found a power up that let me shoot magical fire. In some screenshots, I saw a full-on rifle too that requires two hands to wield.</p>



<p>If you keep up the pressure, you can break an enemy's stance, though parries do more damage to their stance meter. Once they're broken, you can do a critical hit that does massive damage, similar to other soulslikes.</p>

<p>I found that the dodge feels great, as well. It reminded me of the quick dash in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>, and it was easy to position myself to wherever I needed around the enemies.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you've got all the usual soulslikes trappings here, too. There are totally-not-flasks to heal you, and they get replenished at totally-not-bonfires that also respawn all the enemies.</p>



<p>At the lamps, which are <em>Valor Mortis</em>'s bonfires, I could also upgrade my stats using a currency that enemies dropped. Most of them seemed a little boring at first, with basic upgrades like +6% endurance. I imagine in the long run, it'll add up nicely, but for a short 20-minute demo, there wasn't much to play with there.</p>

<p>The most exciting thing about the skill tree was that after you unlock a certain tier of it, you can equip something called an Amber into your tree. These can be found around the world, and they provide more powerful passive upgrades. I get the sense that in the full game, these will play a core part in crafting a build.</p>



<h2>Alt-History Europe That Isn't World War 2</h2>

<p>Aesthetically, <em>Valor Mortis</em> combines the grotesque body horror of <em>Bloodborne </em>with 19th-century French military garb. In fact, this game takes a stab an alternate history, but instead of tackling the trodden paths of World War 2, it looks at the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p>In this universe, Napoleon clinched the victory at Waterloo, continuing his conquest across Europe. Of course, there's more going on here—your character seems to have some sort of telepathic link to Napoleon, implying all sorts of supernatural spooky vibes. It's an intriguing story setup that makes me curious about the ramifications of a magical super Napoleon.</p>



<p>Where it really came together for me was when I ran into the first boss in the demo. It was a giant, fleshy mass of a formerly human soldier—or really, more like a group of soldiers mushed together.</p>

<p>It had three arms on its one shoulder, like a twisted pauldron. Each hand had a flintlock pistol, giving it a ranged attack, while its main arms twirled and thrusted a giant spear. In the second phase, it swapped the spear for a giant claw. In terms of design, it felt like the perfect mix of a From Software boss with the world that One More Level has crafted.</p>



<h2><em>Valor Mortis</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Valor Mortis</em> brings a unique premise to the well-worn soulslike formula, both in terms of gameplay and narrative. The moment-to-moment combat feels good, with just enough challenge to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>The addition of magical powers and supernatural vibes adds a level of intrigue here, as well. It's not a straightforward alt-history romp. Instead, there's something more insidious at play here, and we'll learn more when <em>Valor Mortis</em> releases some time next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game celebrated its 15-year anniversary on August 10, 2025. Below, we speak with the developers of the original game about how it came to be and its enduring legacy.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Trust an elder millennial on this one: The longer you live, the more you start to see the media of your youth reflected in a weird, recursive funhouse mirror. The old Grandpa Simpson "It'll happen to you!" meme is not just a perfect reaction to have here, but a perfect example. It's a famous meme, born from a show that is now mostly known by younger generations as an infinite meme factory, from a scene that was directed at Gen-Xers with nostalgia for the 1970s, by a character lamenting how he was cool in the '50s, and nostalgia for the '40s being the actual intended joke.</p><p dir="ltr">Scott Pilgrim now occupies a similarly strange place in pop culture. Back in the mid-2000s, the original graphic novels were to old-school video games, anime, and Canadian indie bands what Kevin Smith's worship of Star Wars and Marvel comics were to Gen X. Plenty of readers could latch onto the story of a nerdy slacker--the titular Scott--dating Ramona Flowers, a much cooler person with a checkered past, and Scott having to reckon with said checkered past by fighting her seven evil exes. The emotional honesty injected into the story by its creator, Bryan Lee O'Malley made it appeal to the folks who may never have picked up a controller, the folks who simply saw an extremely well-drawn, well-written fantastical slice-of-life indie book. Scott still had to deal with getting a job, paying his rent, and generally having to become an adult. He just happened to do so while speaking to nerds in a whole other secret language of nostalgic metaphors.</p><p dir="ltr">This is ultimately the thing that made Edgar Wright probably the only reasonable pick to handle a film adaptation. Wright had been speaking the same language through his work since the early 2000s with Spaced, Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. This is a man who staged a climactic argument between roommates on Spaced as a round of Tekken 3, had Queen's Don't Stop Me Now as the backdrop for a zombie getting beaten with pool cues, and used the classic tropes of both zombie films and big Hollywood action movies to examine the whole idea of how men evolve within the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566948"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's an art to using pop culture as shorthand. In Ready Player One author Ernest Cline's hands, it's cheap and meaningless, because it's the validation of obsession, rather than saying anything about the people obsessed. In Wright's hands, it's charming and effective, because it's using pop culture to accentuate the emotions that are already there.</p><p dir="ltr">And thus we got Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in theaters in 2010, a still-incredible piece of work, not just as a faithful adaptation of the novels, but a still-staggering achievement in audiovisual storytelling altogether. Its closest visual analogue is the Wachowski Sisters' Speed Racer. You can probably count everything else in that particular echelon on one hand, and two of those slots are Spider-Verse movies. Unfortunately, that's for good reason. Despite the incredible filmmaking, the zeitgeisty non-stop comedy, a fantastic indie rock soundtrack, the heartfelt story, a rock-solid critical reception, and a cast that would go on to become some of the most acclaimed and recognized actors of a generation, the film was actually a major flop. It opened to a $10 million opening weekend and ended at $30 million, only barely making back half its $60 million budget. It was dead on arrival. Turns out, the film has more in common with the Wachowskis' Speed Racer than the visual language. It was hard sell to an unsavvy casual audience unaccustomed to hyperkinetic maximalist storytelling. Universal's marketing department clearly felt the same; the film was sold as a musical with fights instead of songs. It's not a wrong representation of the film, but it's still difficult to sell.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time Scott Pilgrim: The Movie was floundering in theaters, in real-life Canada, Scott Pilgrim was fighting a different fight in a different medium.</p><p dir="ltr">Jean-Francois Major is one of the co-founders of Tribute Games, the folks behind a slew of old-school pixel art throwback titles such as Mercenary Kings, Panzer Paladin, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. But back in 2010, he was part of a development team at Ubisoft that decided to make the company take a big risk.</p><p dir="ltr">"We mostly focused on Game Boy Advance titles: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Open Season, Star Wars, mostly licensed games," Major said, in a brief interview with Gamespot over Zoom. "At some point we found out there was gonna be a movie made on Scott Pilgrim. And we thought, why doesn't Ubisoft make a game based on the [intellectual property]. So we decided to make a pitch and get it cleared through Universal. That was actually the last pixel art game Ubisoft tackled. We kept it retro-looking, kind of a follow up to our Game Boy Advance games."</p><p dir="ltr">For reference, the bigger games that Ubisoft would release around that time included Splinter Cell: Conviction, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, and Ubisoft's first go-around with a game based on James Cameron's Avatar. The closest thing to a retro game in Ubisoft's portfolio at that time is an entirely forgettable TMNT: Turtles In Time remake. So how did Major and his team manage to slip a pixel art 2D game into the company's slate at the time?</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know how to answer this politely," Major said with a laugh. "I think it wasn't really a project that was fully understood at Ubisoft. Luckily, they kind of let us do what we wanted, and didn't ask too many questions. They were more focused on their bigger titles. Ubisoft was shifting away from [pixel art games], and that was kind of our last go. Our whole team was sent to work on more AAA games, and that wasn't really our passion. It was why we ended up founding Tribute." Bryan Lee O'Malley had similar mixed feelings, saying in our brief interview that "they didn't really give us the budget to do everything we wanted to do," and noted that the finishing touches for the game were ultimately farmed out to Ubisoft's Chinese studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, as the film was in production, Majors and his team got to work on what would become Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game, which was, indeed, a rare sight in 2010: a side-scrolling 2D beat-'em-up that felt more like River City Ransom on NES or the original Turtles In Time than the character-action titles of that moment in time. The art style--which had Bryan Lee O'Malley dividing his time between working on the film and providing original artwork embellished by famed pixel artist Paul Robertson--would take most of its cues from the original graphic novels, while still recreating specific beats from the film, including a very cute pixel art version of Edgar Wright directing Lucas Lee's movie at Casa Loma. In return, pixel art Scott would get a cameo on the big-screen. The game character appeared as the icon for Scott's 1-Up after defeating the Katayanagi Twins, as well as in a post-credit bit with Pixel Scott getting to throw a few brick-busting punches, a shout-out that was a complete surprise to Majors and his team.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566949"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game also had an extra ace in the hole with its amazing, eclectic soundtrack from chiptune band Anamanaguchi.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our style was a natural fit for the general vibe," said lead songwriter Peter Berkman in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/13/anamanaguchi-talks-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-10-years-later/" rel="nofollow ">interview with PlayStation Blog</a> back in 2021, "but it was a lot of fun to flex and adapt for certain moments that a 'band playing shows' doesn't normally get to do. Like a bossa nova shop theme, or boss songs."</p><p dir="ltr">His co-writer, Ary Warnaar, agreed. "There were a handful of prompts that took us out of our comfort zones," Warnaar said. "Some of those styles were definitely just for the game, but others started to shape sounds that became a bit more normal to us. Dance-tempo four to the floor tracks were a pretty new thing to us back then!"</p><p dir="ltr">The game was at least more of a success story than the film, selling nearly 150,000 copies within its first year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/02/09/psn-sales-figures-announced/" rel="nofollow ">according to research firm FADE</a>. The problem there was that the success would be, unfortunately, short-lived. Licensing problems aren't new for video games--even as much as the industry loves its remakes and remasters, there are licensed games across the expanse of the medium that may never see the light of day ever again because of either the cost or logistics of nailing down the IP. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was no different, and in 2014, the game was delisted from the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade because of a complete mess of licensing problems between Ubisoft, Universal Pictures, and ABKCO Music, who owned the rights to Anamanaguchi's soundtrack.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't have Limited Run back then, or smaller physical publishers to make sure we have a physical copy that can be resold and kept alive," said Majors. "There was also no release on Steam, that was also an issue."</p><p dir="ltr">That could have been game over in terms of Scott Pilgrim's full-court press into culture at large. But there was a continue attached to that failure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/edgar-wright-scott-pilgrim-box-office-bomb-lesson-1234771212/" rel="nofollow ">a famous story</a> Edgar Wright tells about finding out the film flopped on opening weekend: "Monday morning, [Universal's chief of marketing] Michael Moses sent an email with three words. It was one of the sweetest emails I've ever gotten from anybody in the industry. It said, 'Years, not days.'"</p><p dir="ltr">That email should be nailed to the door, Martin Luther-style, of anyone daring to make art in the 21st Century. Yes, smash hit, immediate success is good, especially as far as the people who bankroll art these days are concerned. But immediate success is a flower. Lasting impact, legacy, and culture are trees.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the film's initial failure in theaters, it soon became a cult classic in the making through word of mouth, with numerous high profile creators singing its praises. The film quickly became a midnight-movie mainstay at Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly theater in Los Angeles. The home release in 2011 was also a minor hit, managing to be the first film to knock Christopher Nolan's Inception off the top of the <a href="http://www.theofficialcharts.com/video-archive-chart/_/26/2011-01-08/" rel="nofollow ">sales charts</a>. More than that, the film’s visual language–incorporating elements from video games, comics, and manga– starts becoming commonplace in media not long after. That particularly shows in Edgar Wright's own work moving forward, with the effects-heavy production playing a big influence in how he'd handle effects in The World's End and editing around music in Baby Driver. Ultimately, the film cracked open a door that Marvel in particular would kick down entirely in the years that followed, leaning heavier on embracing the wilder and weirder aspects of comic book storytelling, compromising less towards Hollywood conventions of four-quadrant blockbusters. The kinetic wall-of-visual-stimulation style of storytelling that nerds had been immersed in for years is now very much mainstream.</p><p dir="ltr">For the game's part, Scott Pilgrim was already riding a wave of nostalgia for 8- and 16-bit style aesthetics, and the game's eventual disappearance from storefronts only drove its popularity further. But also, while there had been occasional blips on the radar as far as old-school beat-'em-ups, Scott Pilgrim showed there was still plenty of life in the genre. Not long after, titles like Double Dragon Neon, Dragon's Crown, and Charlie Murder joined the side-scrolling beat-'em-up roster, paving the way for the true renaissance of the genre when the likes of River City Girls and Streets of Rage 4 hit the scene.</p><p dir="ltr">The story is, indeed, "years, not days." In 2020, the film's popularity warranted an outright media blitz celebrating its modern classic status. The original cast reunited during the COVID pandemic to do a read-through of the entire script, only emphasizing the now-accumulated star power of its cast. The popularity of the stream--currently sitting at over 3 million views <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKqKLnsmoK4&amp;t=3876s&amp;pp=ygUac2NvdHQgcGlsZ3JpbSByZWFkIHRocm91Z2g%3D">on Youtube</a>. The film got a high-profile theatrical re-release in 2021 just before a 4K Blu-Ray dropped. That same year, a miracle happened: Whatever licensing problems had been keeping the game off shelves had been resolved, and it was re-released that January, with a physical release from Limited Run selling 25,000 copies in the first three hours after its announcement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566950"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd be easy to chalk all that up to nostalgia becoming a cottage industry on a scale even previous generations could never imagine. But something very different was happening with Scott Pilgrim in those early days of the pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd moved on to other things, but Scott Pilgrim keeps calling me back," said O'Malley. "The fanbase just keeps growing. They're getting younger. I feel like I owe them more and more each year."</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of responsibility led to what eventually became Netflix's Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Except the nostalgia is a little different here. In 2010, Universal promoted the Scott Pilgrim film with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqmimK80duA"> a 4-minute short on Adult Swim</a>, with Michael Cera, Mae Whitman, and Jason Schwartzman voicing a fully animated scene from the graphic novel. It was a perfect fit on the same network that quietly introduced a generation to Naruto and Cowboy Bebop. It would also only air once, the night before the film was released.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2023, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off became a 10-episode anime splashed across the front page of the world's biggest streaming platform, sharing promo space with the absurdly popular Delicious In Dungeon, and an anime adaptation of Castlevania. In 2025, it's one of the first things Netflix recommends after K-Pop Demon Hunters rolls credits. Scott Pilgrim is no longer a nostalgia trip; it's part of the zeitgeist.</p><p dir="ltr">"You'd expect the audience for Scott Pilgrim would be all 45-year-olds at this point," O'Malley said, "but I have an influx of 15-year-olds coming to conventions these days, and they don't see the references the same way... They're more interested in the characters themselves, and they're the flashpoint, the thing they connect to most."</p><p dir="ltr">It's with that angle in mind that Scott Pilgrim Takes Off forges its own path. The first episode is the animated adaptation of the graphic novel everyone expected, right up until the fight with Ramona Flowers' first Evil Ex, Matthew Patel. Scott fights him...and loses.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the series then becomes Ramona Flowers' story. Her guilt about "dabbling in being a bitch" costing a new partner his life guides the series into a very different direction from the original, a direction that can only come from 15 years of hindsight and maturity. As opposed to most plays for nostalgia, Scott Pilgrim hasn't just grown up with its audience, but adapted to a changing world, while ensuring that even the people who have no attachment to the graphic novels or film have an entry point.</p><p dir="ltr">That entry point turns out to be one far more interested in Ramona being fascinatingly messy, Scott being frozen in time, and how pathetic that stagnation can be if left unchecked. Scott Pilgrim is no longer a reflection of the past, but a living examination of it. As the show ends up proving, nostalgia can be good, but a version of a person that's still open to change and growth is absolutely the most healthy version of that person.</p><p dir="ltr">That same need for growth and change wound up leading Jean Majors and the folks at Tribute Games to the next step in Scott and Ramona's journey: Tribute Games' Scott Pilgrim EX.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Bryan and I] have been friends ever since the original game, and when we started Tribute we always kept in contact," Majors said. "Over the years, after Mercenary Kings, we would reach out and ask if we could have a second stab. Things didn't pan out, but over the years, we kept harassing him. When the anime was announced, we gave it another go...and that's when the discussions became more serious."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="440161799" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"We [initially] targeted older [audiences], because retro games have an easier reach for people who lived through it, but that's no longer true. We noticed with [TMNT: Shredder's Revenge] that it reached this massive audience that was younger, because the people who grew up playing Turtles In Time wound up playing it with their kids. We were missing out on the younger audience who grew up with the series and movie getting its second wind, and we saw it with the direction the animated series went. "</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, Majors said, much like Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, EX will grow up a little more. That especially pertains to where the challenge for the new game will be coming from this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">"The production [on the original Scott Pilgrim game] was so short we didn't second-guess [the difficulty]," he said. "We did some minor playtesting, but we probably should've done a better job making sure it wasn't too hardcore. One thing we're improving is listening to the feedback from the original game, because one of the things they thought dragged the game down was the grinding."</p><p dir="ltr">"[Another thing] that will surprise people is it's not a sequel, or even a simple beat-'em-up either," Majors continued. "We're kind of starting from scratch, thinking about how to structure the game the way we wanted the original to be. It's not as linear, it's more open-ended, Link to the Past-style. You have to [explore the world] a bit more to complete quests. We've adopted more of a River City Ransom structure."</p><p dir="ltr">For his part, Bryan Lee O'Malley is still heavily involved with EX.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just wanna make a video game," he said, laughing. "Just, something new that reminds me of all the games I played growing up."</p><p dir="ltr">Not that there's anything wrong with that at all. But O'Malley is more than aware of the ride Scott Pilgrim has gone on, from a little black-and-white indie comic born of nostalgia and a love of the games, movies, and bands of his youth, to a longtime favorite for multiple generations of nerds and weirdos who have grown up and out over time--a fond memory born of fond memories.</p><p dir="ltr">"If they're 20 now, they were born around the time all this was starting, when I was obsessed with the late '70s, early '80s," he said. "I feel like every generation has that '20 years behind you' nostalgia, 'What was the world like before the one I was born into?' To them, Scott Pilgrim's become this sort of rosetta stone. It's a map to an older version of pop culture."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford says it’s impossible to break the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> servers this weekend through sheer weight of player numbers alone — and he’s so confident he’s publicly promised that Borderlands 4 won’t join the long list of big AAA games whose online systems fail at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched earlier this week and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">immediately saw a concurrent player count on Steam bigger than all the other prior Borderlands games</a>. At the time of this article’s publication, Borderlands 4 had seen an impressive peak of 252,530 players on Valve’s platform, with the peak weekend playing time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, Borderlands 2 set a Steam peak concurrent player count of 124,678 13 years ago, with Borderlands 3 hitting a peak of 93,820 five-and-a-half years ago, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel reaching 68,238 10 years ago. Borderlands Game of the Year Edition has a peak of 23,655.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966621625115107531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford took to X / Twitter</a> to address concern about Borderlands 4’s ability to hold up over this weekend, making a promise gamers aren’t used to hearing from developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here's the thing with this... We are VERY confident in our backend on-line infrastructure and systems. And we're off to an insane start — record breaking,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we know from past experience that peak numbers will start really hitting over this weekend. You're going to be hammering our on-line infrastructure and some people are nervous if our on-line systems can handle the numbers you will be throwing at us.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But here's the thing: our on-line team rules.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford is taking the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to play Borderlands 4 this weekend, and so Gearbox is offering the Break Free Pack to all who play the game from September 12-14. This includes 1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe, and 1 Legendary Ripper Shield, which scales to your Vault Hunter level when redeemed (with a minimum of Lvl 25).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/bkl-1757758196285.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford said he “wanted to see if we could motivate everyone to log in this weekend to see how far we can stress the system,” which is why the free pack was created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued in typically confident fashion:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Listen — I'm telling you that it's going to be VERY unlikely you guys can be enough people to break the backend and take our game down. I know there have been some high profile backend on-line systems failing around big AAA game launches, but not this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am THAT confident.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That said, IF concurrency *does* break our systems, I'll find a way somehow to reward everyone and to make it up to everyone for showing me that it can break. And, you'll have helped expose something that we will need to make stronger, so... win-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here it is... I'm throwing down the gauntlet: you cannot break our on-line infrastructure through too many players. You can't. Hacking doesn't count, btw. Just concurrent players in the game is what we're looking for. Play cooperatively; jump into random people's games; log in and out a bunch of times at peak hours... Whatever you can fairly and reasonably do within the game to add pressure to the system, do it!”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/gettyimages-2165616595-1757758321299.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford sounds very confident in Borderlands 4's servers.

The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up">to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4 don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes">SHiFT codes list</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-im-celebrating-super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-by-finally-finishing-it.1297143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e7e20537869/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Please, angry mob, wait! It's true, I had never finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before this week, but that's not to say that I hadn't played it before. If you'll put your pitchforks and burning torches down for a moment, I promise, I can explain.</p>
<p>It was 2004 when I first came into contact with Super Mario Bros. I remember that because I had just received a Game Boy Advance for my birthday, and in a vague attempt to put me onto a "proper" game and dissuade me from my copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/spongebob_squarepants_movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a> tie-in platformer, my dad bought me the SMB GBA re-release.</p>
<p>Now yes, the handheld's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/classic_nes_series_super_mario_bros">Classic NES Series</a> version might not have been the <em>ideal</em> way to experience it for the first time — the squashed image, poorly lit screen, dinky little speakers, etc. — but six-year-old Jim knew no better, so I showed willing and cracked on with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4f94d0ac5ee8/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That first play <em>has</em> stayed in my head. My friend had the zoomed-in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/super_mario_bros_deluxe">Deluxe</a> version on her Game Boy Color, and I distinctly remember comparing notes about how far we had made it through each level. My first time sneaking under Bowser in World 1-4 and sending him into the lava below was a particular point of conversation at the school lunch table, and while I never made it all that far before hitting a 'Game Over', I still managed to get a good few Worlds under my belt. I must have been better at games back then than I am today.</p>
<p>But then, for whatever reason, I stopped. Perhaps it was my inability to make it through the later stages. Perhaps the 32-bit GBA's larger colour palette and sexy sprite potential made me turn my nose up at anything that felt distinctly 'old'. Perhaps my eye was swayed by another attractive tie-in banger, because who would choose a little-known, blocky curio when the solid-gold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/crazy_frog_racer">Crazy Frog Racer</a> is right there (this is a joke, please don't hurt me).</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, I moved on and never went back. It's not like Nintendo hasn't given me <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/whats-the-best-way-to-play-super-mario-bros-in-2024">ample opportunity to play it</a> on every single console released since, but, at the time, I was far more interested in what was <em>new</em> instead of what I had missed.</p>
<p>So, I never picked it up on a Virtual Console, I didn't have the money for one of those sexy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-a-gorgeous-object-that-leaves-you-wanting-more">Game &amp; Watches</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_nes_classic_mini_review">NES Classic Minis</a>, and you know I wasn't heading up to Argos to buy any of the 'remixed' versions on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nes_remix_pack">Wii U</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/ultimate_nes_remix">3DS</a>. As for Nintendo Switch Online... <em>yeahh</em>, I don't really have an excuse for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/284b7e2426461/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All this is to say that the best part of 22 years have passed since I first played SMB on my Game Boy Advance, and I still hadn't seen the fabled 8-4. Until this week.</p>
<p>Knowing that the 40th anniversary was right around the corner, I decided to buck up my ideas and finally fill in my biggest blind spot in gaming. I fired up NSO, started from the very beginning, and in just a couple of hours — made all the shorter by the blessing of Rewind — I finally made it to the very end.</p>
<p>I don't know where exactly I stopped playing all those years ago, but if I had to guess, I'd say that everything from World 6 onwards felt new. This meant that I had never seen the monochrome 6-3, I had never dodged the flying Cheep Cheep bridge in 7-3 (although that feels like 2-3+, to be fair), and I had to actually work out the maze solutions in the final two castles.</p>
<p>It's got to be said — news flash! — it's a good game. There's a lot here that feels a bit outdated by today's standards (from a 40-year-old game? Never!), but on the whole, I was impressed by how <em>not</em>-outdated it felt.</p>
<p>Mario's jump always has been, and always will be, super satisfying. Lakitu is <em>still</em> an arsehole if you don't bop him on the head at early doors. And I wasn't anticipating quite so much of a difficulty spike at the end. I'm not going to say it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, but I'm once again grateful to the NSO gods for blessing us with the Rewind feature.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7707fe258163c/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After more retries than I care to admit, I ducked under Bowser's legs one last time and finally, <em>finally</em>, found Princess <del>Peach</del> Toadstool in the right castle. It was a good feeling, made all the sweeter by the sound of my previously revoked membership card to the Nintendo Fan Club dropping through my postbox.</p>
<p>And to think, it only took four decades of the game being on the market for me to finish it. Come back in 2036 to see me finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> (this is another joke, I promise).</p>

		<p>It’s heckin’ windy and rainy out and about, so it’s a good weekend to have a cosy time inside playing nice and lovely video games. Definitely nothing spooky and horror-filled – it’s not October yet.

<p>Nintendo is really mixing it up nowadays with merchandise, and the next surprise product on the way is a talking flower. It's not just any talking flower though, it's the same one based on the character from the 2023 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros.

<p>If you were a fan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/you-can-apparently-mute-the-talking-flowers-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">and admittedly not everyone was</a>, as of next spring (alongside the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Switch 2 Edition</a>, you'll apparently be able to own your very own physical version of this flower.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Squadron 42, Star Citizen's single-player campaign, <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been in polishing mode since late 2023</a>, and Cloud Imperium Games has repeatedly stated that <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will finally launch next year</a>. However, a fresh comment made by Content Director Jared Huckaby has worried fans that there might be another delay after all. During the <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/12/squadron-42-wont-be-at-this-years-citizencon-presentation-so-cig-can-focus-on-the-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Star Citizen Live videocast</a>, he said:</p>



<p><em>There will be no Squadron 42 presence at CitizenCon Direct this year. That team is heads down. We drew a line in the sand when we said 2026. I don’t know that we’re gonna make it; I just know that we’re going to do every single thing possible to make it, and part of that is not taking time for the distraction of CitizenCon. It's why we're not doing a larger event this year. It's why we're doing a smaller, more focused thing. Even when we did digital CitizenCon, those were still these big 6, 8, 10-hour things. This is not CitizenCon, it's CitizenCon Direct. It's a much smaller, more focused thing, specifically on the work of the Star Citizen team and what they plan for the next year of development.</em></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the statement quickly started a bit of a panic among the fanbase, whom Huckaby tried to reassure <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/sq42-i-dont-know-if-we-are-gonna-make-it-jared-202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a forum post</a> explaining that he was talking in general terms about the unpredictability of game development, which can always lead to a relatively last-minute delay, and not of specific issues for Squadron 42, which currently remains on track.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games founder and director Chris Roberts recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> of Squadron 42 as a mix of Star Wars and Top Gun. He also shared the team's hope that its launch might be a GTA VI-like event in terms of hype, touting it as the biggest AAA release scheduled for 2026 after Rockstar's behemoth. When it comes to game budgets, he may very well be right; we don't know exactly how much Squadron 42 is going to cost, but we do know that Star Citizen has received $865 million in crowdfunding, and the campaign's star-studded cast (Gary Oldman, Henry Cavill, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, Ben Mendelsohn, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Mark Strong, and Liam Cunningham, just to name a few) certainly cost the developer a pretty penny.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Helsmiths of Hashut, the Chaos Duardin, have brooded for centuries on the wrongs done to them, but with the Hour of Ruin, they have emerged to claim back what's rightfully theirs, and they consider everything rightfully theirs.&nbsp; In this article, we check out the first <em>Age of Sigmar</em> release for the spiritual cousins of <em>Warhammer's</em> Chaos Dwarfs, the Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Age of Sigmar </i>for a while on the site, and you can check out our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition launch box <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and as the Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set also functions as their Spearhead force, you can check out our getting started with the Spearhead style of gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>




<h2>What's In the Box</h2>

<p>The Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set acts as the perfect introductory set for the new faction, and contains all the rules for the full planned release of miniatures, along with containing a complete Spearhead force that can be used straight away while you flesh out your full&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> army.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li>Helsmiths of Hashut Battletome</li>
	<li>32 Helsmiths of Hashut Warscroll Cards</li>
	<li>Helsmiths of Hashut Transfer Sheet</li>
	<li>14 miniatures (War Despot, Dominator Engine, Tormentor Bombard, and 11 Infernal Cohort)</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-2.jpg?itok=W2KgM3gL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-2.jpg?itok=1tnXRb-A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set includes a full Battletome, Warscrolls and Spearhead Force.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Tip Of The Glaive</h2>

<p>The Helsmiths of Hashut Spearhead force is a complete force for the Spearhead <em>Age of Sigmar</em> game type. This force can be used against any other <em>AoS</em> Spearhead box using the unique warscrolls for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Helsmiths' Spearhead force is led by a War Despot who boosts nearby units' ability to capture objectives. They're armed with a Daemonflame Glaive, with 5 attacks that hit and wound on a 3+. They're backed up by 2x 5 warrior units of sturdy Infernal Cohorts, one of which also has a Gong Carrier who can be removed to return D3 slain units to the battlefield, further adding to their resilience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-3.jpg?itok=rtbcYkSE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-3.jpg?itok=PHCbP7dp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The<em> Age of Sigmar</em> Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set is led by a War Despot, backup by 2, 5 warrior Infernal Cohort units.</figcaption></figure><p>The real power of the force is the towering Dominator Engine and the Tormentor Bombard artillery piece. The Dominator is the fastest unit in this force, and its movement and attacks can also be boosted with demonic power points, which your force gains a growing number of each turn. It's immolation cannons start off with 5 attacks, each dealing D3 wounds. The Bombard has a range of 30 inches, but its attacks are also boosted for larger enemy units more than 12 inches away. It can also be used to reduce the control score of enemy units by allocating demonic power points to the Bombard, to stop them from scoring objectives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-4.jpg?itok=4CV0G8VA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-4.jpg?itok=ZLhk7kte 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set Tormentor Bombard and Dominator engine give your force a huge punch.</figcaption></figure><h2>Thick Beards, Horns And Tusks</h2>

<p>On top of those in the Spearhead force, their Battletime details a number of durable and devastating units with which to grind their enemies down. Our favorites are the Infernal Razers, armed with Flamehurlers or Blunderbusses. The flamehurlers have a shorter range, but more attacks, and the blunderbusses have a slightly longer range, but are easier to wound and deal 2 damage each.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths also have Bull Centaurs, who, along with looking awesome, really capture the Helsmiths' cavalry aesthetic. They add 1 to their charge rolls for each demonic power point they have, and can also inflict extra mortal wounds by rolling a 6+ for each model in the charged unit, with the roll also boosted by the number of their demonic power points.</p>

<p>There's also an option for a different flavor of Dominator Engine, armed with Bane Maces for an entirely close combat experience of smashing your enemies into the ground, and for those who prefer range, the Deathshrikeker Rocket Battery adds another artillery option with 3 attacks dealing D3+2 wounds, with their Watch Them Burn reaction able to deal maximum damage to monsters or war machines.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set is a great start for the Chaos Duardin, and the Spearhead force it contains offers a great insight into their larger game. The Infernal Cohorts stand firm on objectives while the War Despot supports them, and then the Dominator Engine wreaks havoc, as the Tormentor Bombard rains down fire on units that look like they might score other objectives.&nbsp;The miniatures across the range really capture the feel of the Chaos Dwarves of old. Thick black beards and tusks standing proud, and the demonic weapons they carry add an eerie feel to them.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Tying in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-is-set-to-release-in-april-2026/">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Nintendo is remastering Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, launching on 2nd October. It will cost you a pretty penny to get their collection of Nintendo Wii titles, though, with the two game bundle costing $70 / £59, or being available individually for $40 / £34 apiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 blasts off October 2nd! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21HVvGkVV_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remasters promise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals for both games.</li>
<li>Assist Mode to help with your adventure, which can be turned on and off whenever you like. It lets you play with more health, heal just by standing still and return to solid ground if you fall into space.</li>
<li>An additional chapter of Rosalina’s picture book in Super Mario Galaxy, and an entirely new picture book in Super Mario Galaxy 2.</li>
<li>Listen to the soundtrack of each game from the main menu with 154 tracks in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>Switch 2 support is being included for free, letting both games be played at 4K output in TV mode and 1080p on the built-in screen.</p>
<p>While it’s great to have these two games on Switch – they’re still regarded as two of the best platformers of all time – and the upgrades are nice, the price tag stings. Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel launched in 2007 and 2010 respectively, with the first getting much more love and attention with re-releases since then. In 2015 both games were released on the Wii U eShop in unenhanced form and with a discount $20 price point. A few years later, the first game was then included in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/16/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-switch/">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection for Mario’s 35th anniversary alongside Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. This time-limited collection wrapped the three games up in emulation layers to enhance visuals and UI, before being pulled from sale just six months later.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/01/21/super-mario-galaxy-2-a-modern-masterpiece/">Further Reading: Super Mario Galaxy 2 – A Modern Masterpiece</a></h2>
<p>This duology remaster does go further than 3D All-Stars with Switch 2 support and some gameplay additions, and it does allow you to avoid double-dipping by just buying Galaxy 2, but it’s still an immediate point of controversy to have this sticker price.</p>

<p>It's that time of the week once again, and now that the Super Mario 40th anniversary plans have been fully unveiled via the latest Direct...well...we're maybe not gonna be diving into quite as much Mario as we had sorta hoped this weekend, as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario Galaxy 1 and 2's</a> re-release and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> are a little ways off yet. But hey, we got more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> deets (and that's all this guy cares about right now)!</p>
<p>Yes, there was a big ol' Nintendo Direct yesterday and we got a ton of new info — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> has a release date! The new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> has a release date! We're getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon life sim</a>!</p>
<p>Besides the Direct, somebody out there is playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> (look, we've all got our crosses to bear), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> is the newest member of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">the Difficulty Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-every-exciting-new-game-from-the-acclaim-showcase">Acclaim held its own showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever it is you happen to be picking up to play this weekend, or if you're taking some time off from games to do there things (like dream about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>) make sure to let us know in the comments; for now, let's pass you over now to some of the Nintendo Life team as we detail what we're up to this weekend.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was all geared up and hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 1 and 2</a> announcement that we got, although I now have to wait (and they're really quite expensive), so cold water has been applied to those plans.</p>
<p>Now, instead, I'll defo be diving into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a>, I'm excited for that, and I'll also take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, which I've been keen on since it first got announced a while back. I'm really hoping the talent at ProbablyMonsters delivers something special here! Oh, and my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> playthrough must low-key continue!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I recently got to Deepnest in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Lovely place. Looking forward to exploring more there, definitely. Beyond that, I still haven't fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> continues to surprise/delight/astound.</p>
<p>And beyond <em>that</em>, Episode 9 of Robert Ashley's <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://alifewellwasted.com/" href="https://alifewellwasted.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Life Well Wasted</a> is sitting downloaded on my phone. It's been nearly three years since the last and, while I feel it deserves my undivided attention, listening in the kitchen while prepping something tasty sounds like a pretty perfect evening. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Y'know what, I might just play that newly-announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Bananza</a> DLC! It looks <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm on a bit of a <strong>Contra</strong> binge at the moment, so I'm playing a lot of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Anniversary Collection</a> on Switch. Those early entries really are peerless.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, same as last weekend, and every evening this week: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar.</a> What a game! Marvelous XSEED finally found the recipe for success!</p>
<p>It's packed with tiny, beautiful, entirely unnecessary details, like snow falling off trees when you run into them, lanterns and window shutters swaying in the wind, and animals that lie down to rest. I am so happy that this game exists, with this level of love and care put into it, and I hope that it's a sign of equally good Story of Seasons games to come!But also I will be on a plane next week, so I might need to pick a good Plane Game (again — I promise I don't usually travel this much. It's a family reunion! Blame them, not me.)</p>
<p>My personal game development projects right now are centering around MICROGAMES — fishing minigames, specifically, but more generally speaking, any tiny games-within-games that have compelling and moreish mechanics. I know that sounds like I should just play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/warioware_move_it">WarioWare</a>, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for. I'm thinking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley's</a> fishing minigame, or (if anyone remembers it) the carpentry minigame in <strong>Puzzle Pirates</strong>. Recommendations absolutely encouraged! It's Research™!</p>

<p>Yes, I'm still playing Silksong. That's it. That's the tea.</p>
<p>My review is coming next week, but it's safe to say I <em>love</em> it. Have a good weekend, everyone!</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company this week announced connectivity between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> is scheduled for 2026.</p>
<p>Like other games, once linked, it will allow trainers to transfer Pokémon from the new game to the cloud service (and vice-versa). You'll be able to "bring select Pokémon from past games to Lumiose City. There's also some fine print attached to this announcement that outlines the transfer restrictions in place (this includes a reminder about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</a> connectivity with HOME):</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2zowjng&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> got some of the spotlight in the latest broadcast, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-kirby-amiibo-will-apparently-be-nintendos-most-expensive-amiibo-ever">and apart from those new amiibo</a>, it's also been revealed there will be <em>another</em> 'Direct' taking place in the future.</p>
<p>This "2nd presentation" will once again be hosted by the game's director Masahiro Sakurai. We don't know what specifically will be revealed in this next show just yet or when exactly it will be aired but it's "on the way". During this week's Nintendo Direct, it was mentioned how "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" would be shared in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai also acknowledged this announcement via social media (here's a rough translation via DeepL):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was introduced to [a] Direct within [a] Direct... I'll do it! It's not something I can make right away, but please be patient"</p>

<p>When we find out more about this upcoming Direct, we'll be sure to let you know. In the meantime, you can check out the previous Kirby Air Riders broadcast, which revealed the playable roster of racers, courses, items and power ups, multiplayer aspects and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo also announced in the same Direct how its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app would be getting regular updates about Kirby Air Riders leading up to the title's release.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there'll be a few (paid) gates you'll need to pass through before you can even access this particular library. Not only will you need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription (aka the premium-priced tier), but you'll also be "required" to fork out for an accessory.</p>
<p>Apart from this information during the broadcast, Nintendo has also made note of the requirement on its official website:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lihzkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch and Virtual Boy (Cardboard Model) for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch are required to play the Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership required to access Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two headset options to choose from. If you don't want to pay <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) for the replica, there is the cheaper cardboard model, which will set you back <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>. Nintendo's website also notes how users will need to have a paid Switch Online membership to purchase these accessories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a mixed reaction online to this, with some Nintendo diehards welcoming the Virtual Boy's return with open arms, while others are venting frustration about the price, the requirements to access it, and how there's still no option or proper workaround to officially experience these games <em>without</em> a headset.</p>
<p>Once again, this library will launch on 17th February 2026, with both accessories due out on the same date. You can see the games on the way to this particular digital library in our previous story:</p>

<p>Apart from the cost of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> pack, one other talking point following the latest Direct is the pricing of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> amiibo.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/kirby-air-riders-amiibo-price/">highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, these new figures will reportedly be Nintendo's "most expensive amiibo ever". To reiterate, it means fans will apparently have to fork out more than they've ever previously had to for first-party amiibo. One difference compared to your regular amiibo is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">swappable base</a>.</p>
<p>A single Kirby Air Riders figure will set you back $50 USD, or if you want to pick up both the Kirby and Waddle Dee figures, you'll be looking at a total cost of $100! Retailer listings with these same prices attached have already gone live in the US, and we'll be on the lookout for prices in other regions as they pop up.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Fortunately, the amiibo for these games are slightly <em>less</em> expensive. Samus and her new bike is priced at $40, while standalone versions of Samus and Slyux are $30 each. As for the Galaxy amiibo (Mario &amp; Rosalina), they'll be $40 each.</p>

<p>In case you missed it during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> announcement, Rosalina's Storybook will be getting a physical release.</p>
<p>This product is based on the same storybook featured in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and will be available via the My Nintendo Store website. The US store has now confirmed it will be priced at $24.99 (or your regional equivalent) and arrives later this year on 25th November 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo has teamed up with Dark Horse Books to release this "beautiful hardcover volume". It's worth noting that the new pages featured in the upcoming releases <em>won't</em> be included in the physical print. Here's the official fine print about this from the latest Direct broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rosalina's Storybook does not include newly added pages from the Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's the official description, along with another look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our story begins a very, very long time ago with a young girl who spotted a rusted spaceship holding a small star child, Luma.</p>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.</p>
<p>Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present Rosalina’s Storybook —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>

<p>A new paid DLC update is now available</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest Direct broadcast was filled with all sorts of surprises, but one thing you might not have expected was DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, just months after the game's initial release on the Switch 2, DK's latest outing has now been bolstered with some smashing new content, and it's available right now. As part of the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a>, Nintendo has also bumped the base game up to Version 2.0.0.</p>
<p>We've got the full patch notes here, which go into a little more detail about the changes. This is the second update for the title, which also makes "several other changes" to improve the overall gameplay experience. Here's the rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 2.0.0 (Released September 12, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the paid DLC DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush.
<ul>
<li>If you have not cleared the main game yet, you can go to DK Island by talking to Squawks at the Racing Layer.</li>
<li>If you have cleared the main game, you can go to DK Island by striking the Warp Gong after hearing about the “Bananza Rehearsal” from the Elder.</li>
<li>After reaching DK Island, you can play Emerald Rush by talking to Void Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of Banandium Chips that can be stored has been increased from 9,999 to 99,999.</li>
<li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned, even if you haven't cleared the "main game" just yet, you can still go to this island by interacting with Squawks on the Racing Layer. Of course, it's paid content, so you'll need to fork out $19.99 / £16.99 (or your regional equivalent) before you can access it.</p>
<p>And if you are still unsure about this game, there's now a Switch 2 demo you can download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>

                <p>By the end of this weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is probably going to be one of the biggest launches of 2025. It hasn't gone off without a hitch, however.

Now, Borderlands 4 has been accused of including spyware by some vocal fans online. Those rumors have been so pervasive that Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two Interactive has already shared a statement denying them.</p><p>The issue at hand involves the kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which some have accused of being modified to collect data about players. Borderlands 4's updated terms of service was also presented as evidence that the game was being used to spy on players, hence the response from Take-Two.</p><p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," wrote a company spokesperson on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected, but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service."</p><p>The company acknowledges that it does collect information about users "to deliver its services to players," including personalization and compatibility options. Take-Two's position is that it discloses this info in the terms of service to be transparent with fans.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/gearbox-responds-to-worries-about-borderlands-4s-terms-of-service-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> PC Gamer</a> noted that the latest furor over spyware stemmed from "a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything."</p><p>Similar concerns about older games from the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-says-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games-as-borderlands-review-bombing-continues?_gl=1*1gflm7s*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTc5NjUxMTE1OC4xNzU3NzI0ODE5*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTc3MjQ4MTgkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTc3MjQ4MTgkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*czE3NTc3MjQ4MzQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTc3MjQ4MzQkajYwJGwwJGgw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">surfaced earlier this summer</a>, which essentially received the same response from Take-Two as the latest allegations. The company also asserted that its updated terms allow it to go after "abusive mods" that don't respect the intellectual property of the company, while allowing single-player non-commercial mods to be distributed freely among fans.</p><p>Gearbox has shared <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/nvidia-optimization/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">links for optimizing NVIDIA card graphics settings</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/2/596285654384682506/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PC troubleshooting guide</a> for anyone having trouble running the game.

            <title><![CDATA[NHL 26 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-26-review.1297008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not have the audience of football, baseball, or soccer, but to its proud fans there’s something truly special about hockey. It’s the cold air of the arena, the weight of the puck against your stick, and the feel as your skate glides across the surface of the ice. To their credit, the developers at EA Vancouver seem to get all of that, and it’s led them to create an enjoyable NHL simulation that has earned a dedicated audience. That dedication, however, has increasingly been tested in recent years as the series has failed to truly move forward in any meaningful way. EA Sports NHL 26 continues this dynamic with a game that nails most of the elements that make hockey special, but it never feels like the kind of significant jump over what’s come before that might make buying yet another version exciting rather than obligatory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played a hockey game from EA at any point over the last few years, you have a good idea of what to expect from NHL 26. The lynchpin of the series is Franchise mode, which allows you to take the team of your choosing on a season-long quest to hoist the Stanley Cup. It’s basically the default mode, showcasing what the series is best known for and it still does that all pretty well. Individual games are fast, the controls are intuitive, and EA Vancouver has spent years refining a formula that mostly works. Granted, there are very few other hockey games available right now, and those that do exist don’t have the official NHL players or teams; that lack of competition might be what leads the developers to play things so safe and leave so much unchanged year to year. To be fair, it’s hard to fault them too much for not fixing what isn’t broken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this situation has created an unfortunate trend for the series that’s made each year’s version feel like baby steps, and NHL 26 continues to focus more on smaller tweaks than on substantial changes. As a result, it’s easy to miss adjustments made beyond mirroring the big roster changes we’ve seen over the offseason, such as Mitch Marner being on the Golden Knights after leaving the Leafs, and Matt Dumba appearing on the Penguins following his Dallas departure. As of this writing, EA Vancouver seems to have done a pretty good job making sure everything is up to date, including representing the Utah Mammoth with their new name, uniforms, and arena (following a season under the temporary “Utah Hockey Club” label). Lastly, PWHL has been updated to add the women’s league’s two new teams from the 2025-2026 season, though that mode feels completely unchanged beyond that. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s easy to miss adjustments made beyond mirroring the big roster changes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Franchise mode seems to be the most popular single-player mode in EA’s yearly NHL games, I really enjoy the customization options and the general approach to the sport found in the narrowed focus of Be a Pro. As someone that grew up playing hockey, there’s something that feels really authentic about focusing on controlling an individual player. There’s a greater need to consider line changes, playing in position, and setting up CPU-controlled characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I was pleased to find that some of the bigger changes this year can be found here, but I’ve found that they aren’t all positive. Some of the biggest improvements come from cutting out what hasn’t worked: NHL 26 has finally dropped the often-mocked and frequently repeated “pricey pond hockey” opening scene that appeared across multiple games. You’ll no longer see the same repeated cinematic sequence with an agent talking about how you’re so passionate about hockey that you’re playing pond pick-up with a bunch of kids. Instead, you’re dropped right into the player maker. And mercifully, EA has also scaled back on the frequent coach meetings from past Be a Pro modes, but the catch is that the replacement might be even more monotonous: press conferences. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>NHL 26 has finally dropped the often-mocked and frequently repeated “pricey pond hockey” opening.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of taking part in press conferences is actually kind of neat, and the initial questions help to shape your on-ice personality. The hockey press will ask questions like your approach to free agency, and choosing one option will improve your likeability with teammates, while the other helps your brand. However, the execution gets dull fast once you’ve taken part in several in a row. That might be a little too real: I’ve attended real-life NHL press conferences, and the questions from sports journalists really can be as groan-inducing as they are here sometimes. How do I feel  about not winning the division? How do you think?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">NHL 26 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, the impact from press conference responses on player stats often feels unfair. At one press conference, I was asked about modeling my career around a specific player, with multiple options to choose from. I apparently picked the wrong one, and it immediately led to a decrease in my brand stat. Even worse, NHL 26 doesn’t always make it clear what answers will have a negative impact on your brand or the feelings of management, so a seemingly innocuous response can have an unforeseeable consequence. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A smart change, though, has made NHL’s most intimidating mode more approachable for me. Putting together a team built out of NHL greats in Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) takes a lot of time and effort. It can also take some real currency, though you are awarded with daily freebies that can help shape a decent team without paying extra. I still don’t necessarily want to take my team up against the passionate players who dominate online with a combination of skill and large wallets, though; sometimes you want to play without the pressure of competing with real people. So it’s a welcome change that for NHL 26, EA has replaced last year’s HUT Squad Battles with a new offline Cup Chase mode that offers a chance to build up a team and try them out in a full single-player campaign with multiple difficulty levels. I was grateful to have the chance to jump into games using my custom team without having to worry about getting schooled by people fiercely protecting their online rankings. And anybody that wants to do so can take that team online just as they normally would in HUT. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was grateful to have the chance to jump into games using my custom team without having to worry about getting schooled by people fiercely protecting their online rankings.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Online or off, though, NHL is feeling increasingly behind the annual sports game pack graphically. That’s despite the fact that last year, NHL 25 marked the first game in the series to abandon PS4 and Xbox One and shift focus to current platforms. But NHL 26 still doesn’t feel like it’s really pushing PS5 and Xbox Series X|S to the fullest. The ice itself pops on the screen nicely, and there are lots of impressive details, including wear to the surface as a game progresses, but just about everywhere else is a letdown. The character models are rough, with players, coaches, and fans often looking pretty ugly relative to what we’ve seen in other recent sports games. There are also some weird choices and oversights that are holdovers from past games, like team logos getting cut off on specific screens. Crowd reactions also feel stuck in the past, with awkward celebrations that would be right at home on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, I found the audio much more enjoyable. The menus have some great new songs this year, including tracks from groups like Wet Leg and The Hives. I never would have thought of “Catch These Fists” as a hockey song, but it fits undeniably well. In the games themselves, EA Vancouver continues to replicate the authentic sounds of each rink, with team-specific cheers and organ sounds. The commentary is also pretty faithful to the current NHL viewing experience; it feels like watching a nationally televised game, offering the same chatty play-by-play that you’d expect to hear on TNT. That said, I was grateful for the option to toggle it off when it got repetitive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Possibly the worst audio in NHL 26 belongs to Macklin Celebrini, though. The San Jose Sharks forward can be heard offering career advice in Be a Pro mode, and it’s clear not all hockey players are cut out for acting.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">NHL 26 is a competent entry in the series from EA Vancouver, even if it doesn’t do enough to stand out either from past years or other sports games. It still plays well enough, and after all these years there’s still something exciting about banking a goal in, or setting up the perfect pass. I rarely found myself unhappy with the actual gameplay, no matter how familiar it felt. On top of these things that worked well before, there are some small improvements that are welcome, like enjoying our collections of Ultimate Team players offline. At the same time, this series has stagnated visually, with relatively ugly players and crowds contrasted against beautiful hockey rinks. NHL 26 has left me feeling like I’ve just watched a 6-5 overtime win in April when my team has already been eliminated from playoff contention: there’s enjoyment to be had, but I can’t help but hope they get off to a better start next year.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-26-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The overwhelming success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was one of the biggest stories of 2024 and a life-changing event for solo dev LocalThunk. However, LocalThunk is still only one man and he's revealed that his previously promised Balatro 1.1 update will not be arriving this year.</p><p>LocalThunk explained the reasons for the delay in <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy message on his official site</a>, but it ultimately boils down to the name of his post: "I'm Slow." He apologized to players for the delay before expressing his desire to avoid repeating the crunch mode of 12-hour days he put in when Balatro was approaching launch and stated that he prefers to treat the work as a hobby rather than a job.</p><p>"I still love drawing my silly jokers," wrote LocalThunk. "I carry around a notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game, and thankfully I still consider this my hobby, but the prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible. I am working slowly, but I like it that way. I love getting sucked into rabbit holes and I don't like trying to force things creatively."</p><p>LocalThunk noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-creator-only-just-recently-100-completed-his-own-game/1100-6532649/" data-ref-id="1100-6532649">he only recently reached 100% of the achievements</a> in his own game, which made him excited about the prospect of doing it again after the 1.1 update is complete. He also assured fans that it will happen, but the 1.1 update won't be released until it's ready.</p><p>Balatro was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it also lined up awards at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a> before winning Game of the Year at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/" data-ref-id="2900-6173">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>.</p>

It's available in PS5, Switch 2, Switch, and Xbox Series X versions.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is a ground-up remake of the original PS1 version of Dragon Quest VII that launched in 2000. This is actually the second remake of the sprawling console JRPG; it was also remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. However, Reimagined looks to be an even bigger overhaul of the game, featuring a gorgeous new artstyle reminiscent of sculpted figurines that resembles the FMV cutscenes of the PS1 version. It also maintains the top-down viewpoint of the PS1 version. Based on what we've seen so far, the new visual style looks to be a great fit for the late Akira Toryiama's classic character and monster designs.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the announcement trailer and the game's official website, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will also make notable changes to the story and gameplay. While the exact changes to the story have not been detailed, Square Enix says the narrative has been "reworked to be pacier and more accessible to players," which isn't surprising, considering the PS1 and 3DS versions are notoriously large games that can easily take over 100 hours just to complete the main storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side, Reimagined maintains the turn-based battles of the original game, with the option to increase battle speed or turn on auto-battling. Like the 3DS version, Reimagined will let players see monster encounters on the field, and you'll automatically defeat low-level enemies without having to enter combat. The game will also feature a reworked class system that lets party members select two classes at once, as well as tweaks and updates to each of the various vocations.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined isn't the only upcoming Dragon Quest remake. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</a> also launches on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on October 30. Preorders are available for $60 on al platforms. The game will feature enhanced versions of the first two Dragon Quest games from the 1980s with all-new graphics, gameplay updates, and even new content. The new HD-2D version follows up a similar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HD-2D remake for Dragon Quest 3</a> that launched last year on all consoles, and recently got a Switch 2 Edition upgrade that increases performance on Nintendo's new handheld. Eventually, we'll hopefully hear more about the long-awaited Dragon Quest 12, but these remakes of classic entries in the series will keep fans busy until then.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Dragon Quest remake deals</h2><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-amiibo-accessory-preorders-new-releases-2025-at-amazon/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Direct Switch 2 Preorders At Amazon - All New Games And Amiibo</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorder/1100-6533331/">Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Console Bundle Is Finally Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 And Samus Amiibo Preorders Available Now</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-joyful-dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controller-2025-preorder-guide/1100-6534678/">Astro Bot Joyful DualSense Limited Edition Controller Preorders Are Live</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-special-edition-arcade-machines-cheapest-standing-cabinet-2025/1100-6534472/">Check Out Arcade1Up's Budget-Friendly Mortal Kombat And Pac-Man Arcade Cabinets At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-6-film-steelbook-library-4k-blu-ray-collection-in-stock-at-walmart-september-9/1100-6530389/">James Bond 6-Film Steelbook Library 4K Blu-Ray Collection In Stock At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-bricktember-exclusive-lego-bundle-deals-september-2025/1100-6534392/">Walmart Has Exclusive Lego Bundles This Month: Spider-Man, Star Wars, Disney, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-tactical-edition-free-dlc-collectors-edition-restock-buying-guide/1100-6524133/">Metal Gear Solid Delta Collector's Edition Restocked At Amazon (September 2)</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-charlie-kirk-shooting-reddit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/following-%E2%80%98recent-events-%E2%80%99-mods-lock-helldivers-subreddit-while-helldivers-2-stays-open.1296987/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Due to what they call “recent events,” the moderators of the r/Helldivers subreddit have temporarily closed the community. Meanwhile, the moderators of r/Helldivers2 have decided to keep theirs open.</p><p>At around 11:30 eastern, the moderators of r/Helldivers, which has 1.2 million members, locked the community, meaning that moderator approval is required for all new posts and all new comments on posts. They pinned a message to the subreddit explaining the decision.</p><p>“Due to recent events and the high amount of posts about the topic, we will be locking the subreddit temporarily. We're aware of what happened, our modteam doesn't condone it,”<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nf6g7e/rhelldivers_is_locked_temporarily_requests_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the post reads.</a> “In any case, posts and discussions about it are against this sub's rules regarding real-world political discussions.”</p><p>Although they don’t specifically reference the killing of Charlie Kirk, that is the only recent event that would require condemnation from the moderation team of r/Helldivers. The alleged killer engraved one of his shell casings with the phrase “Hey fascist! Catch!” and then arrows pointing up, right, and three arrows pointing down. Those arrows are the inputs needed to<a href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-robinson-journalism-wsj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> call in the 500kg Eagle bomb in the game <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>.</p><p>There haven’t been any new posts in the r/Helldivers subreddit since 11:15 am ET. Aftermath has reached out to the moderators of r/Helldivers for comment, but they did not reply in time for publication.</p><p>By contrast, the comparatively smaller r/Helldivers2 community—boasting only 318,000 members—have not only kept the community open, but the mods have used <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1nf5sxh/damn_not_for_nothing_but_its_gonna_be_weird_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a community member’s post</a> about the potential weirdness of having a <em>Helldivers 2</em> tattoo as a “megathread” for discussion on the killing of Charlie Kirk. Megathreads are used by Reddit moderators to keep conversations contained to one post, rather than let their communities be overrun with dozens of posts on the topic. People are allowed to discuss the shooting of Charlie Kirk and its connection to <em>Helldivers</em> <em>2</em>, but in the designated megathread only.</p><p>“Locking it down isn't managed democracy. People can have THIS outlet. It's contained here.&nbsp; You have a place to go and discuss that fine. 5000 places with 2 comments, nope,” wrote one moderator. “Being able to have the conversation is important. It happened for a reason. Unprecedented times etc.”</p><p>Responding to another user asking if today was a weird day to be a r/Helldivers2 moderator, they said it wasn’t anything they couldn’t handle.</p><p>“Community is necessary because of events like this. If we as people spent more time learning about each other and overcoming our differences instead of bickering we might actually achieve equity and not just equality,” the moderator wrote. “As Helldivers it's our responsibility to keep those we love and are sworn to protect safe from outside evils.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/12/ign-first-nioh3-3-exclusivehandson-banner-1757639293167.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With just two games, the Nioh series has already cemented its place among the best of the soulslike genre, thanks to its uniquely fast-paced action, deeply customizable builds and playstyles, thrilling boss battles, and a certain fluidity to its combat that feels like Team Ninja’s own signature touch. Based on my five hours of hands-on time with a new preview build, the upcoming third installment is shaping up to continue that trend of excellence, staying true to the core of what has always made the series so successful, but shaking up just enough to challenge veteran players to rethink how they approach its many difficult combat encounters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Nioh 2, Nioh 3 is shaping up to be an iterative sequel that doesn’t change much about the core systems that were established in Nioh 1; instead adding brand new layers on top of that core to reinvigorate the combat system and force players to engage with it differently. Nioh 2 did this by adding in burst counters and yokai shifts, and Nioh 3 does this primarily by giving the player two styles that they can shift between on the fly: Samurai and Ninja style. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first played Nioh 3, back when it was offered up as a limited time demo, I was a little unsure of how I felt about this split. Samurai style, after all, is basically just the way you’d normally play Nioh, minus the ability to use Onmyo Magic; while Ninja Style just felt like a much faster and DPS oriented stance that comes with the substantial drawbacks of no longer being able to use Ki Pulses to regain your stamina, and no longer having the three sword stances to switch between, which are both two staples of Nioh’s gameplay. Not to mention that having two different styles means nearly twice as much inventory management, since they both have their own completely separate sets of gear, and if there’s one game series that already has more than enough inventory and loot management, it’s Nioh. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>During my playtime, something clicked with me with regards to Samurai and Ninja style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While loot remains an issue, during my playtime, something clicked with me with regards to Samurai and Ninja style. Not only did I gain an understanding of what each style was good for and when I should swap to one versus continuing with the other, but more importantly, I got a grasp of the sheer amount of options that having two hot swappable styles each with their own equipment loadouts and skill trees brings to the table. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While in Samurai style, you of course have access to the three stances – high, medium, and low – and all of the skills that come from each of those stances. You also are able to to use Ki Pulses to restore spent stamina without having to wait for it to recharge, making it great for sustained offense where you’re able to kind of just plant your feet down and stand and fight against a tough enemy. There’s also a new Arts Proficiency Gauge that fills up as you deal damage and successfully guard, but decreases whenever you get hit. Once it’s full, you’re able to use a powered-up version of your heavy attack, which adds a nice little reward for playing well with a careful balance of offense and defense. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja style on the other hand lets you go absolutely wild. Your dashes go crazy far and are super fast compared to the dodges in Samurai style; instead of stances, you’re able to equip up to three ninja tools; you’re able to very quickly dash to an enemy’s backside to deal extra damage; and most of the weapons take advantage of the fact that Nioh 3 adds a jump button, allowing you to even punctuate your ground combos with a jump cancel, letting you tag on even more damage with air combos. On top of all of this, for both styles, you also have your guardian spirit transformations, guardian spirit skills, Soul Core skills, it’s just a lot of tools to take with you into every battle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, all of these added options in Ninja Style come at the aforementioned cost of not being able to use Ki Pulses to restore stamina, so I did find myself having to rein in my lust for aggression – it is still a stamina-driven soulslike after all – but I felt a level of creative freedom in combat expression that I typically feel in a good character action game, and I eagerly anticipate getting my hands on the full game and seeing what a high-level character can do once the skill trees start getting maxed out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soul Cores also return in Nioh 3, but they’re a bit different this time around. They still appear as random drops from enemies and will let you use that enemy’s signature attack, just to give you yet another option when it comes to how you choose to dispatch your foes. However you have two choices of how to equip them. When you rest at a shrine, you can put them in your Onmyo Box in either the Yin or the Yang position. The Yin position is what I just talked about, you’ll gain some stat increases and the ability of the monster to use in combat. But if you place a core in the Yang position, you’ll instead be able to get spells and items added to your inventory that will refresh every time you rest at a shrine. One of the Soul Cores had a fairly underwhelming skill, but when I equipped it in a Yang slot, it gave me invisibility scrolls that I could use to sneak past tough enemies. It’s a wonderful change to an already excellent system, and I can’t wait to mess around more with it in the full version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big new tentpole feature for Nioh 3 is the addition of non-linear open field-type levels, complete with sidequests, a variety of points of interest with unique challenges and rewards, and wide open environments rife with opportunities for exploration. This is in contrast to Nioh’s typical linear levels with the occasional optional branches off the beaten path that ultimately loop back around. I got to experience one of these in my hands-on time – the frozen region of Kamigamo – and while Nioh 3 doesn’t seem to do anything surprising with its more open level design that hasn’t been done before, the shift was a refreshing change of pace. Right away, the first thing I did was a combat challenge called a Crucible Spike. This was a sealed-off combat arena with multiple waves of enemies that I had to defeat in order to proceed. Clearing the Crucible Spike improved my Spirit Force, which is a new resource that governs your usage of Spirit Skills, and also gained a new spirit skill for one of my guardian spirits. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every time you complete one of these points of interest, your exploration level will increase, and each time it increases, you’ll get an extra bonus.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s really what makes me excited about these open field levels, because these Crucible Spikes, along with other types of points of interests, are strewn all over the map, the challenges are fun, and the rewards are great – which is all the incentive I need to seek them out. Every time you complete one of these points of interest, your exploration level will increase, and each time it increases, you’ll get an extra bonus, from more icons being revealed on your map to give you some direction on where to explore, you may get an added stat bonus while you’re in that specific area, or you may get skill points to spend on your Samurai or Ninja skill trees. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, Nioh 3 is shaping up to be exactly the same kind of iterative step above its predecessor that Nioh 2 ended up being. The style switching between Samurai and Ninja is an excellent addition that adds new layers of depth to an already stacked combat system, and the new open fields offer up even more incentive to explore than ever before, with fun challenges, mini bosses, and secret treasures to discover in every corner. It all ran incredibly smoothly as well, making me forget for a moment that this game is still a ways off, with a planned release in early 2026. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first]]></content:encoded>
