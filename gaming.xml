			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I caught up with Rich Lambert, Game Director for Elder Scrolls Online at ZeniMax. This wasn't the first time I interviewed Rich - I met him in person <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-e3-2019-interview-focusing-on-performance-improvements-team-is-aware-crossplay-is-what-players-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at E3 2019</a>, and then we had a number of remote interviews over the past five years or so. This year, though, is special for the MMORPG, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-10th-anniversary-qa-with-rich-lambert-looking-back-and-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has turned 10</a>. ZeniMax is doing several celebrations with the community throughout the whole year, with the excuse that the console version launched around a year after the PC version.</p>
<p>With the release of Gold Road, the yearly expansion (or Chapter, as they like to call them) firmly behind us, we looked to its making and then moved to the future, answering quite a few long-standing community questions on highly requested features.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls Online - Welcome to Home Tours" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7i8xMctv4ss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You announced some new events as part of the 10-year celebration, right? In Milan and elsewhere.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Milan, San Diego, and then I don't know if it's 100% announced yet, but we'll go to PAX Australia as well.</p>
<p><strong>Cool. Overall, how is the ten-year anniversary of Elder Scrolls Online going for you so far?</strong></p>
<p>It's been amazing. The players and the community that has gone to these events are just really enjoying themselves. They get to see us, but they go to see their friends. In Amsterdam, we had a group that has been doing podcasts together for almost 10 years, and they've never actually met in person. One lives in Turkey, the other guy lives in the United States, and the first time they met each other face-to-face was at our Amsterdam event, which is cool. That just kind of echoes all the way across things. Also, putting the event together was really cool because we had to look at stuff we hadn't looked at in years—literally years—and so it's just been really cool.</p>
<p><strong>I imagine this is also kind of a unique opportunity to get more feedback on the game live from the fans.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, one hundred percent. We sit down; we talk with them. Actually, at the tavern, which was in July earlier this year, I had a number of people come up to me with thick books with just notes of things. Some of them were poems and pictures and stuff like that, but others were like, hey, we polled our Guild, and these are the things that we would love to see added or changed or updated in Elder Scrolls Online, so it was really cool.</p>
<p><strong>You <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Gold Road Chapter. What was the reception like compared to last year's Chapter, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>It's been really positive. Players have really reacted well to the zone. It's a forested type of area, but it's not greens and browns, right? It has bright colors and interesting environments. Then they love Ithelia, the new Daedric Prince we created. They absolutely love her.</p>
<p><strong>Since it was a different type of story from the ones you've done before in the game, what did you do differently? What were some of the challenges?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest challenge was that we were writing a brand new Daedric Prince, and that's never been done before. Figuring out how to make her stand on her own and not feel the same as all the others was a big challenge for us. And then like, what are her traits? Because a lot of the Daedric princes cover a lot of the different traits.</p>
<p>When we started going in and thinking about well, Hermaeus Mora is all about order and keeping everything in line and knowing everything. We started bouncing in on what's the antithesis of that? That's where we got into this chaos, the threads of fate and bouncing around, and so that was a really fun project to figure out. Once we got that, it helped inform some of the stories that are going on in this one.</p>
<p><strong>When you came up with the idea of Ithelia, was Bethesda Game Studios already on board with that, or did it take some convincing?</strong></p>
<p>It took a little negotiating. It's something new, right? And it's never been done before, but that's kind of how we work, frankly. We pitch ideas, we talk, we work things out. Dragons was a really good example of that as well. They didn't want us to do dragons initially at launch because they weren't in our timeline, or at least there was no recorded history in our timeline of dragons, and then we worked through 'What if we did it like this?'&nbsp;The players were the source of this. So, in the end, they were like, 'That's cool, it can work.'</p>
<p><strong>You've just released a new Elder Scrolls Online update dedicated to housing, right?</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, yeah, travel day to Gamescom. The team back home was hard at work launching Update 43. The big system that we added was Home Tours, which allows players to easily share their homes with other players so they can see what they've created with the housing system. Our housing system, as you know, is really unique in that you can build anything. You can put chairs and ceilings, you can put tables and chairs and sofas together to make some other objects, and so that creativity is something that was really hard to show off because you have to know somebody in order to go to their home. Now, they can just share it, and you can go there right away.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With the crafting bag, it is a small number of items that stack nearly infinitely, but with a furnishing bag, it is a large number of items that don't stack. We're working through how to do that without destroying the Elder Scrolls Online servers and the database.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On that note, here's a question from the community: they'd like to get a furnishing bag.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've heard that a lot. It is something that we've been looking into for a while. It's not as easy to do as the crafting bag because with the crafting bag and how databases are set up, it is very cheap; I guess it is the easiest way to say, or less intensive, to just implement a number in a row in a database than it is to add more rows.</p>
<p>With the crafting bag, it is a small number of items that stack nearly infinitely, but with a furnishing bag, it is a large number of items that don't stack. We're working through how to do that without destroying the Elder Scrolls Online servers and the database, because it's really expensive. We have millions of players all having thousands of objects, so it adds up very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>What about an Armory bag?</strong></p>
<p>An armory bag. We've talked a lot about that when we did the Armory system, and we went back and forth on whether we can just pull stuff out of your bank or not. And there were actually a lot of scenarios where players could break the game. For instance, what if your inventory's full and you're pulling stuff out or into the bank? Or your bank is full. What if there's lag? What happens if two items get duplicated, right? There's lots and lots of issues with doing that.</p>
<p>What we decided was we were just gonna not give the player more inventory before their item sets, and instead go the route of what we did with the stable, where you could still collect them all and get them out of your inventory, but not easily be able to swap back-and-forth.</p>
<p><strong>With Gold Road, you added Scribing, a precursor to Spellcrafting, to Elder Scrolls Online. How are you planning to build upon this new system in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, in Update 43, we did add some more scripts, which allow players to do more things with them. We added some Frost-based scripts, so now you can have Frosty magic if that's what you're into. I believe the updated number of unique combinations is 5500 or just over 5500, so there's lots of opportunities to mix and match stuff. But if players continue to play the system and really enjoy the system, we are going to continue to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Does that include styling as well?</strong></p>
<p>Styling actually had a bunch of new additions in Update 43 as well.</p>
<p><strong>What about new Sorcerer pet models or skins?</strong></p>
<p>We have had a lot of feedback on this well, ever since we did the Warden and the Bear skin with that. For the Sorcerer pets, it is not a 'we don't want to do it', it is more a 'how do we not blow the game up doing it'? Because there are a lot of performance issues with that. But we have absolutely been looking at that.</p>
<p><strong>Will companions be able to wear helmets in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We made the design decision really early on that we wanted the characters to always be visible because that is their one personality trait, the unique face. We kind of go back and forth on that, but that was the original intent. Players can customize their abilities and all that other stuff, but we still wanted their personality to show.</p>
<p><strong>What about them using player gear?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know. That's a good question. I'd have to dig into that war. Companion gear is different from player gear. We did that again for performance reasons. The player items are very, very expensive on the database, and all the companion items are not, so whether or not they could actually wear player gear in the future is something we have to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, you introduced curation for the Undaunted. What about curating other stuff like motif pages that can drop from city daily quests?</strong></p>
<p>We're slowly going through and looking at those pain points. We did the Undaunted this past update. I don't think I'm speaking out of turn, but we also did some Imperial City curation. We curated the weekly Trial rewards as well, so we're going through that and looking at what makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Can you make mount upgrades work for all characters?</strong></p>
<p>We get that feedback a lot, too. Not easily.</p>
<p><strong>Could you ramp up the speed with which old styles are made available again?</strong></p>
<p>I can talk to the group that manages all that. There's a kind of a balance in that if you do it too much and too often, then players get overwhelmed, so we have to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>Can you increase the total furnishings in the house?</strong></p>
<p>We've got that one a lot, too, and those limits are there for performance. What we don't want to ever happen is a player puts something in their home and then they crash and can never get back in there. That's why the limits exist, but we are looking at ways to improve and increase that. But they're there for that reason. We don't ever want players to be in a situation where they can't access the house.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of performance, you still support PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but there are already whispers of the console generation that will follow PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. The question is, how long do you plan to support them for Elder Scrolls Online? Will you maybe drop them at some point?</strong></p>
<p>As long as players are on them and playing, it doesn't make sense to remove them. We have shown in the past that we will do it when it makes sense. With Windows 7, we supported it for a very, very long time. When it became end-of-life and Microsoft stopped supporting it, and there were fewer and fewer players actually on it, we dropped support.</p>
<p><strong>So you still see a lot of players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?</strong></p>
<p>There's tons of players. And on Mac as well, that's another one we get questions about why we support Mac. Because there's players there to play. We don't ever want to take it away if we can.</p>
<p><strong>Elder Scrolls Online recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on GeForce NOW. Did you see an influx of new players from the cloud?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>I asked you before in a previous interview, but are there any talks with Microsoft about adding the game on Game Pass?</strong></p>
<p>It's on Game Pass for consoles but not on Game Pass PC. There are various technical reasons why it's not there, but we are looking at it because we get a lot of game continues, and it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>I know you completed the server hardware upgrade a while ago. Are you still looking at ways to improve server performance beyond that?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the new hardware helped, and for the most part, things are pretty stable and solid. However, there are absolutely still periods during peak hours when it's not as good as we want, so we're definitely looking into further improvement.</p>
<p><strong>The next update will focus primarily on PvP. Are there any tidbits that you can share? Anything at all?</strong></p>
<p>I believe Gina Bruno (<em>the Elder Scrolls Online Community Manager</em>) let slip that it might be Battleground-related.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The new server hardware helped, and for the most part, things are pretty stable and solid. However, there are absolutely still periods during peak hours when it's not as good as we want, so we're definitely looking into further improvement.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What about the Alliance War? Are you doing anything about that?</strong></p>
<p>That's where we start to look at performance, and then also at some quality life, such as item curation. Then we're constantly adding new cosmetics that you can earn through PvP, adding new item sets and Rewards for the Worthy.</p>
<p><strong>I know this is a question you get asked repeatedly, but do you have any thoughts about crossplay? Is it even doable?</strong></p>
<p>It's never been a no; it's always been a holy hell. We made many decisions in 2007 that are very difficult to change, and then we'd have to get all of the first parties together to make sure that they're good with how we would go about implementing. It's a huge technical challenge to solve. Do I think we will get there in the future? Maybe. I think that's where technology is just going in general. People just want to be together and make it easy and remove all the friction to play with each other. But like I said, we started building this game in 2007, when that wasn't even remotely a thought in anybody's head back then.</p>
<p><strong>On that note. Elder Scrolls Online has turned 10. How long do you have a roadmap for internally?</strong></p>
<p>Game development, there's a fuzziness to that, right? We have a 5-year plan of where we want to go, then we have like a 3-year, more solidified plan of the things that we want to focus on, and then we have an 18-month locked-in roadmap. We're constantly iterating and updating that. Just because we have a 5-year plan doesn't mean we will stop after 5 years; it's just that's as far ahead as we have the brain power to think, at least right now, but as long as players want to continue playing the game, we're going to continue to support and update Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/">blog post</a> earlier today included a 30th anniversary image (above), and eagle-eyed observers <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1831772340218425426?t=K1MbVYnbDeXJP8fX75S4kg&amp;s=19">have spotted</a> a suspicious-looking PS5 design in the montage that looks identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">PS5 Pro leak</a> from a week ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs reported last week</a> that it had seen retail packaging for the PS5 Pro and created a sketch that showed three black stripes in the middle of the outer facades of the console. Those three black strips can be clearly seen in Sony’s montage image, looking rather Adidas-like and unlike the stripe you can find on the PS5. In fact, the existing PS5 model is also in the montage, with a single stripe through the middle.</p><div><figcaption><em>Sony’s image vs. the leaked PS5 Pro sketch.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony / <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs</a></cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Sony’s Instagram story.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Dealabs said it was expecting an announcement during the first half of September, but I don’t think anyone expected it would come in the form of a teaser image from Sony.

A source familiar with the PS5 Pro tells me that all games released on or after September 16th need to support the PS5 Pro, so that suggests that Sony’s official announcement of this console is coming real soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a> was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).
</p>
<p>If you do still own a physical copy of Black &amp; White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black &amp; White, and its first build was just released yesterday.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Openblack has been in development for several years - since at least 2018 - with people contributing to the project over on Github. You can now <a href="https://github.com/openblack/openblack?tab=readme-ov-file">download it as a pre-built binary</a>, although there's still some command line fiddling necessary to actually get it to run.
</p>
<p>That command line requirement is a signal that it's still in many ways early days for the project. Its developers consider it v0.10, so I wouldn't necessarily rush to dig out your old discs yet. Still, there's a lot of potential here for those seeking a version of Black &amp; White that runs better on modern machines and which has support for more operating systems. There's already a Linux build available, for example.
</p>
<p>In short, I'd like to be able to play Black &amp; White on Steam Deck one day, and this is likely the only avenue by which that's ever going to happen.
</p>
<p>Even if it's impossible to buy digitally, it's not impossible to play Black &amp; White on modern computers if you do own a copy, merely less than ideal. For those willing to try, I think <a href="https://www.bwgame.net/threads/running-black-white-on-windows-10.7916/">these old instructions</a>, which includes installing a slightly-modernising fan patch, should still work.
</p>
<p>And of course, if it's a choice between following a fan-led open source project to modernise Black &amp; White, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-is-back-with-new-god-sim-masters-of-albion-which-looks-like-a-stripped-down-black-white">following Masters Of Albion</a>, I'd wager the former is more worth my time.</p>

<p>As someone who only recently bought a PlayStation 5, I’m on the fence about a PS5 Pro reveal. I’m excited about all-new hardware and, hopefully, a more powerful system overall for this console generation. But at the same time, what about a PlayStation 6? Anyway, let’s not focus too far ahead in the future. When will the PS5 Pro be revealed to the masses?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-sony-officially-reveal-the-ps5-pro">When Will Sony Officially Reveal the PS5 Pro?</h2>



<p>According to rumors, Sony will officially unveil the PlayStation 5 Pro sometime this month, in September, but there’s no precise date just yet. Following a recent tease in their 30th-anniversary image, which you can check out here at Insider Gaming, two versions of the upcoming console were sneakily revealed to the world. More specifically, their silhouette and design.</p>



<p>Back in March, we reported that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro was in development</a> and may launch in late 2024, before the holiday season. As rumors and leaks start to ramp up, it appears we were on the money.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-a-ps5-pro">Should You Buy a PS5 Pro?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>While it’s your money and your decision to buy a PS5 Pro whenever it launches, we can tell you that, according to information circulating about the system, it is supposed to feature 45% faster rendering than the current PlayStation 5 systems, along with a new resolution upscaling method known as PSSR, alongside other technical features and a sleek new design. If you don’t mind spending a bit of money on yourself, the PS5 Pro may wind up being an excellent investment, so long as Sony continues pumping out quality single-player titles and not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mishaps like Concord</a>!</p>



<p>When the PS5 Pro is revealed, will you be among the first in line to pre-order the system?</p>



<hr>



<p>I can’t think of a better game for the PS5 Pro than Hogwarts Legacy 2, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. Games recently revealed is a top priority</a> for its studio now!</p>

<p>Sony has teased the PlayStation 5 Pro Design in an image celebrating PlayStation’s 30th anniversary.</p>



<p>Albeit a difficult tease to spot if you didn’t know what you were looking for, the PlayStation 30th anniversary shows the outline of the  PlayStation 5 Pro, which is easily recognizable thanks to the multiple lines in the middle of the console. From the image below, you can see the PlayStation 5 Pro in the middle, whereas the standard PlayStation 5 (the revised/latest version) to the right.</p>

<p>Last week, dataminer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-will-have-a-similar-design-to-the-slim-models-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billbil-kun revealed that the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will have multiple lines/slits in the panel of the console. Billbil-kun findings suggest that it’s been uploaded on the backend of retailer websites… somewhere, indicating that the console will soon be announced.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k25/">NBA 2K25</a> has only been out for a couple of days for those who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k25-preorder-guide-release-date-bonuses-editions/1100-6524830/" data-ref-id="1100-6524830">preordered the game</a>, and players have already discovered a hilarious bug that clones users' MyPlayer so they can either team up with themselves or play against them</p><p dir="ltr">As the name suggests, MyPlayer is a mode in which users create an original basketball player and play out their career. Shortly after this bug was discovered, some players took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit </a>(via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-bug-has-players-competing-with-clones-of-their-own-myplayer" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>) to show other players what had happened to them. This bug seems to be triggered when players pick a team different from the one they played during an intro sequence in MyCareer</p><p> Since this bug was discovered, some players decided to just have fun with it and post highlight clips of themselves running up and down the court, praising themselves. One Reddit user uploaded a clip titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1f9nl01/great_hustle_from_all_3_of_me/" rel="nofollow ">Great Hustle from All 3 of Me</a>," in which their MyPlayers went in for an alley-oop.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, some players are also voicing their frustrations about this bug. The main issue seems to be how it's affecting their MyPlayers stats. This bug sometimes causes players to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1f9gspj/myplayer_going_against_myself/" rel="nofollow ">their points cut in half</a> when playing against a clone of themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1f8vknb/comment/llhr617/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">2K spokesperson commented on the</a> bug and said that the team is investigating the issue, which can be seen on the official Discord's issue tracker. But as of now, it's unclear when the bug will be fixed. NBA 2K25 is scheduled to come out on September 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>
This December marks 30 years since the Japanese launch of the original PlayStation, and Sony has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/">revealed</a> how it plans to celebrate the brand's big three-oh - with the likes of digital soundtracks, PlayStation-themed toys, and more on the way.
</p>
<p>
Sony's celebrations begin later this month, with a free online multiplayer event and esports tournament running from 21st-22nd September. For the duration, it'll be possible to play online multiplayer in any PS4 or PS5 game without having a PlayStation Plus subscription.
</p>
<p>
The concurrent PS5 esports tournament, meanwhile, will feature challenges for the likes of EA UFC 5, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8</a>, and Guilty Gear Strive, with specific details set to be published via the <a href="http://compete.playstation.com/">PlayStation Competition Centre</a> at a later date. A special 30th anniversary avatar and other game-specific prizes will be up for grabs, and interested players can sign up to compete via the PS5's Game Hub or the in-game PlayStation Tournaments button.

<p>
Next on Sony's anniversary schedule are those digital soundtracks, with one new soundtrack set to be released each month between this October and January next year. God of War, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-war-2">God of War 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-war-ghost-sparta">God of War: Ghost of Sparta</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>, Starhawk, and Unit 13 are all on the list, and they'll be available to stream on Spotify or purchasable from digital storefronts including Amazon and Apple Music. Additionally, a curated PlayStation 30th anniversary playlist can be accessed on Spotify from today.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Shapes of Play, a new range of PlayStation-themed amusements created by the team that designed Sony's consoles. Shapes of Play: Battle is a board game in which two players attempt to line up four different shapes of the same colour to win, while Shapes of Play: Create is a set of colourful magnetic building blocks. Finally, there's Shapes of Play: Recharge - which appears to be a range of stress balls - and all three will launch this December via <a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">PlayStation Direct</a>.

<p>
And finally for now, there's My First Gran Turismo - a free trial designed to attract "players of all skill levels" to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. This promises to include cars, tracks, and race events intended to "evoke the nostalgia and excitement of the very first GT experience". It's due to launch for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 some time "this holiday".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-to-partner-with-fortnite-ahead-of-globals/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite posted a Tweet earlier today (September 5, 2024) claiming that the Battle Royale will be partnering with NASCAR ahead of Globals, the massive Fortnite tournament championship happening this weekend.</p>



<p>So, what does this partnership mean for the racing sport and the Battle Royale?</p>



<h2 id="h-nascar-partners-with-fortnite-for-globals">NASCAR Partners With Fortnite For Globals</h2>



<p>Fortnite Globals is a yearly event that takes the best players around the world who qualified during the year’s various FNCS events and puts them all together in one arena. It is the best of the best going head-to-head against each other. </p>



<p>And now, it seems as if NASCAR is joining in on the fun.</p>



<p>The official Fortnite Competitive Twitter posted a Tweet today, saying: “Nascar is ready to bring the energy to the FNCS Global Championship! Stay tuned for more content!”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this is the only information we have been given thus far, it does confirm that the popular sport will be a part of the massive Fortnite event.</p>











<p>No large esports event is official without any large title sponsors. Fortnite is no exception to this rule. The game has partnered with quite a few large names and companies in the past. This, however, is Fortnite’s first venture with NASCAR.</p>



<p>So, will NASCAR have something to do with Fortnite Globals? Or will they simply just reveal more details about the partnership at the tournament?</p>



<p>Fortnite is notorious for building something up only to have it be a bit of a letdown in the public eye. We will just have to be patient and wait until more is announced at Globals.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-returning-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-reveals-he-is-returning-tomorrow.973446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-returning-tomorrow/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dr Disrespect hasn’t been seen in front of a camera since the end of June when allegations surfaced online implicating him in a ‘minor messaging’ scandal. He since copped to the wrongdoing and was subsequently dropped by his peers, sponsors, and companies he worked with before plunging into radio silence amid an ‘extended vacation’.</p>



<p>He has just announced he’s returning tomorrow.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-again-but-what-awaits-him">Back Again, But What Awaits Him?</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect is coming back to streaming tomorrow. The charismatic and controversial content creator posted a cinematic ‘trailer’ on social media revealing his return, and it was created in the aesthetic that the streamer’s fans have come to know over the years, suggesting that nothing has changed for ‘The Two Time’.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>He then posted a comment immediately under the trailer in an attempt to pre-empt some of the inevitable responses:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WHeRe’s He CoMinG from, Epstein iSlAnd? </p>



<p>iTs a pDf nOt a DoC </p>



<p>hE BloCkEd mE, leT Me TaKe a ScReEnsHot aNd PosT</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitting he was banned</a> from Twitch in 2020 after messaging a minor in 2017 through the platform, Dr Disrespect has lost tens of thousands of followers across all platforms. He was demonetised on YouTube, and his key sponsors – such as Turtle Beach – cut ties with him.</p>



<p>In recent days, Dr Disrespect suggested that he might not be coming back to play games, making a post claiming that people streaming video games were hosting ‘snoozefests’. Despite the controversy surrounding the notorious streamer, millions of impressions have been landed within mere hours of his post going live, and even some supporters have come out of the woodwork.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that nobody knows what his return will look like – he’s just adamant that it’s happening tomorrow.</p>

                <p>If you're curious as to why Atlus chose the name Metaphor: ReFantazio for its forthcoming RPG, you're not alone. In fact, it was one of the first questions asked during a recent press event held by the studio in New York City, in which GameSpot and various other outlets were given the opportunity to play five hours of Metaphor: ReFantazio and chat with some of its core development team members.</p><p dir="ltr">The answer to the question is just as simple as it is intriguing: It's because the entire game itself is a metaphor, producer Junichi Yoshizawa explained. And though that might sound obtuse or perhaps even a bit hamfisted, it didn't take long for me to understand and appreciate just what he meant.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas many fantasy worlds bear a resemblance to our own and contain themes and stories we recognize or relate to, Metaphor: ReFantazio is quick to emphasize and explore this connection. In the game's opening moments, for example, an unnamed voice asks you for your name--not what you want to name your character, but <em>your</em> name. He then asks how you view the idea of fantasy. This metanarrative pops up throughout, as the protagonist frequently turns to a novel he carries with him, one containing stories about a technologically advanced land with skyscrapers, roads, and humans living peacefully--a fantasy version of our own world. There are many ways this could go wrong; the game could feel preachy, cheesy, or annoyingly meta, for starters. And yet, what I played of Metaphor: ReFantazio avoided falling into any of those traps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362836" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362836"></a><figcaption>The game's protagonist approaches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the nearly five hours I spent with it, I found myself enamored with its characters, budding story, overall gameplay, and yes, its overarching metaphor. I was impressed by the way some of Atlus' most prolific developers had clearly utilized everything they've learned to create a sprawling fantasy that retains a sense of humanity, despite humans actually being grotesque monsters in the game's world. I have my hesitations--the main party doesn't seem quite as engaging as previous Atlus games and certain narrative elements feel a bit tired, having been used in several other fantasy games. Overall, however, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a game that left me wanting nothing more than to play another 60+ hours of it; it is easily the game I am most excited for this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">During the preview, I was able to play two separate sections of Metaphor: ReFantazio: an entirely new save file, which allowed me to see exactly how the game kicks off, and a save file approximately nine hours into the game--a glimpse into how its gameplay, systems, and story would eventually evolve.</p><p dir="ltr">The game begins with the protagonist--who, unlike Persona's heroes, is fully voiced--riding alongside a handful of strangers on a caravan headed to the Royal Capital. Within a minute of the game starting, however, the vehicle is attacked, ultimately separating him and his pixie-like companion Gallica from the group and forcing the pair to traverse the wastes outside the city on foot. It's here we learn a bit more about why the pair is headed to the capital; according to Gallica, we need to enlist in the royal military in order to find our confidant and deliver to him an important message. Naturally, a great deal more comes to light as the story progresses, such as the protagonist's seemingly reviled Elda lineage and his relationship to the current prince. More than anything, though, this shake-up serves as a way to introduce the player to exploration and combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat itself feels like a mix of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, combining the former's flashy combat and the latter's use of Player Actions during battles rather than a more fixed turn order. However, many things feel entirely fresh, giving Metaphor its own identity. One of the biggest changes is the game's real-time combat system, which grants players combat bonuses--such as reduced enemy health and first strike--if you successfully attack an enemy out on the field. We've seen a bit of this in the Persona and SMT series, as you can sneak up and attack an enemy to gain an advantage in battle, but it's a much larger part of Metaphor thanks to those perks and the fact that you can quickly eliminate weaker targets without having to enter turn-based combat. As you can imagine, this is a huge time (and frustration) saver. As the game lacks the same Baton Pass system as Persona 5 and enemies aren't always stunned when you exploit their weaknesses, attacking more fearsome foes out on the main map offers a new type of strategy unique to Metaphor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362840-metaphor_battle_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362840-metaphor_battle_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362840"></a><figcaption>The team fights a grotesque creature.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362840-metaphor_battle_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also new to Metaphor is the Archetype system, which, contrary to my initial belief, is not very similar to the Persona system. Rather than summons, Archetypes are essentially job classes that are unlocked both as the story progresses and as you increase your bonds with various characters; according to P-Studio, there will be around 40 to experiment with. And whereas Persona allows only your main character to shake up their skills--and permits them to do so mid-battle--all of Metaphor's party members are able to change classes, but can only do so outside of battle in a Velvet Room-like location referred to as Akademia. Something I particularly liked about this feature is that certain Archetypes offer strange advantages that don't solely correlate to "fire beats ice." For example, selecting the Merchant class and throwing money at a money-hungry enemy will stun it more effectively than an elemental attack. My only (shallow) disappointment with this was that changing Archetypes doesn't come with a cool outfit transformation a la Final Fantasy Tactics or Final Fantasy X-2, but I digress.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of combat, the similarities between Persona and Metaphor truly shine, as it features three familiar and beloved systems that cement the social-sim aspect of the game. Royal Virtues are the new Social Stats, while Followers are essentially the same thing as Social Links. Considering the game's main objective is to gain enough renown to become king, these systems feel completely at home, particularly the Followers portion. As you travel across the Kingdom of Euchronia, it is vital that you form connections not only to main characters, but to the general population of certain territories as well. For any fellow BioWare nerds out there, this system is reminiscent of Mass Effect 3's Galactic Readiness, as you can check in at towns and see if you remain in favor and are likely to get their vote for king.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet the most important system that Atlus chose to incorporate is the in-game calendar. The Metaphor: ReFantazio team has repeatedly said that fear and anxiety are two of the game's core themes; these are partially explored through the calendar system, which--even more so than the ones in the Persona games--does not allow for you to do everything. Instead, you will have to pick and choose which missions you embark on and which alliances you'll form. There <em>seems</em> to be no wrong way to go about things, but it will certainly spike anxiety in completionists who sought to max out every social link in the Persona games; it seems extremely likely that you won't get that luxury here and that multiple playthroughs will be required in order to see everything Metaphor has to offer.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the nice thing about this is your choices feel even more precious and rewarded. In the second part of the demo, I was given a great deal more freedom. Whereas some of the players around me darted straight toward the objective, I decided to go on a two-day journey down to a crypt, where an interesting boss battle and dark artifact awaited me. After doing this mission, I was able to form a new bond with a strange and shady character. It also gave me a better look at how dungeons will be structured and--thankfully--they differ from the largely procedurally generated ones found earlier Persona games or Mementos; according to the developers, each dungeon is uniquely designed, a choice they made to stress how important that aspect of the game is. Whereas Persona's dungeons can begin to feel like the necessary but exhausting filler that keeps you from your next objective, Metaphor's feel like worthwhile objectives in themselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362839-metaphor_royal_capital_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362839-metaphor_royal_capital_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362839"></a><figcaption>The protagonist hovers along the Royal Capital.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362839-metaphor_royal_capital_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is all especially appealing given how wonderful Metaphor's world is to experience--I wanted to see what was out there. While large-scale traversal between cities and various points-of-interest is relegated to selecting a location on a larger map, the locations I visited were beautiful and, more importantly, felt alive as I explored them. I loved wandering around the old castle town of Martira, with its worn streets and dingy-yet-beautiful Bavarian homes. In the various alleys of the town, and around the fountain set right at the center of its square, I met disgruntled villagers, odd storytellers, haughty knights, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Although my time exploring Martira was brief, I still feel as if I got a grasp of the history and culture Atlus was aiming to convey, which is an impressive feat--especially considering P-Studio's previous titles. While many of the titles that the developers behind Metaphor: ReFantazio have worked on are set in real-world Japan, Metaphor's fantasy setting means they could no longer rely on a player's innate understanding of how the world looks and functions. This has its pros and cons; it's great to finally break free from real-world and high school settings and see what Atlus can do in a unique world, particularly visually. However, it did feel perhaps overly derivative at times. If you've played your fair share of fantasy JRPGs--Final Fantasy, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Trails, for example--some aspects of Metaphor feel familiar.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I absolutely loved the unique metanarrative the game is weaving, and how it boldly declares that video games and fantasy are both inspired by, and can inspire, the real world. Though some might dislike the notion, Metaphor is a deeply political game--and I don't say that merely because it's centered around an election. I've always admired how Atlus, in some ways, addresses social issues and is unafraid to have deep conversations with its players; the games often address abuse of power, prejudice, mental health, abuse, grief, love, and similar topics. In Metaphor, the team continues that tradition by drawing attention to how what media we consume impacts our beliefs. You can sense that video games aren't "just video games" to the team; they understand that stories hold power. That said, some of what the game tackles--most notably prejudice, militarism, and inequality--feel a bit superficial in this small portion I played; hopefully we'll see more complexity as the game progresses and its story will be elevated.</p><p dir="ltr">I also remain a bit hesitant-yet-hopeful regarding the game's characters. This is not because I didn't enjoy who I met, but because as of right now, the party feels a bit small and its members feel slightly one-note. The scene in which Strohl discovered his Archetype and rips an iron heart from his chest gave me chills--and cemented the just and noble (if not <em>slightly</em> arrogant) young man as a new husbando for myself. But so much of his personality and his backstory felt very similar to other fantasy archetypes; this was the case with the game's mentor-type character, Grius, as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362837-metaphor_character_screenshot_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362837-metaphor_character_screenshot_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362837"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's supporting cast of characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362837-metaphor_character_screenshot_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Don't get me wrong: Atlus could very well be intentionally using fantasy tropes--the fact that it's jobs are called Archetypes would seem a great indicator that that's the case--but considering the studio is phenomenal at exploring relationships and creating interesting characters, I am hoping for more as I play on. There are several strong elements at play in Metaphor: ReFantazio--the character designs are interesting, the voice acting is wonderful, and the one-on-one interactions I had with my teammates on the Gauntlet Runner (the name of your party's vehicle/traveling home) felt tailored and special. In short, even if I can't romance any of my companions (womp womp), I just want to feel connected to them.</p><p dir="ltr">It feels almost unnecessary to dive into the game's art and music because Atlus always kills it. The characters retain that signature Atlus style, albeit with a fantasy twist. Monsters are still creative, demented, and at least a couple of them, phallic, and feel more or less in line with what the studio has done before, which is a good thing. It's interesting to note, though, that the fantasy element means we see more blood than we would in something like Persona; it took me by surprise at first but seems very natural and gives the game that darker tone.</p><p dir="ltr">Another interesting deviation is that while the Persona games feel very cohesive in regards to style--characters, UI, and many artistic features pull from a similar color palette, style, and overall "vibe," for lack of a better word--Metaphor relishes in juxtaposition. The darker tone of the game and the locations I walked through are given this fantastical whimsy thanks to its UI filled with pinks, teals, yellows, and more variety than the scarlet-soaked Persona 5 or black-and-blue Persona 3. It's an interesting mix-up and visually establishes Metaphor as its own series. The game's music similarly aids this, as it is unlike any of the poppier soundtracks the studio has created. Shoji Meguro, the lead composer behind Persona 3, 4, and 5, triumphs at creating a world that feels oppressive and regal through sound alone. Each track I heard was dramatic and intense, oftentimes featuring operatic voices crying out in Latin.</p><p dir="ltr">The greatest praise I can give in a preview is simply, "I did not want to stop playing it," and that is certainly the case with Metaphor: ReFantazio. I am eager to know these characters better, to understand how Euchronia connects to our world, to see how the game's themes of fear, oppression, and resistance play out, and to see the protagonist crowned king. Suffice to say, I am eagerly awaiting October 11, when Metaphor: ReFantazio releases on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions/" data-ref-id="5000-631815">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a> is the first Quidditch video game in over two decades, giving the fictional sport the proper sports game treatment it's lacked for so long. Despite a noticeable lack of microtransactions available, it comes with most of the trappings of modern live-service games, including an excess of digital currencies--Gold, Moonstones and Winged Keys being the main ones. But while Gold and Moonstoones flow freely as you play, Winged Keys are a lot sparser, and it will take a while to earn enough of them to buy anything. But the task is hardly an impossible one--below, we'll break down how to get more Winged Keys as you play Quidditch Champions.</p><h2>How to get more Winged Keys in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</h2><p>Quidditch Champions is here, and it's got a lot of Harry Potter-themed cosmetics and skins that you can earn. And without microtransactions, you'll be able to unlock everything just by playing. You'll quickly find yourself with lots of Gold and Moonstones, but Winged Keys are few and far between. After my first several hours of playing Quidditch Champions, I'd earned enough Gold to buy the Hermione Granger skin from the Market, but I only had 20 Winged Keys--very far from the 250 needed to buy the Cedric Diggory, Cho Chang or Draco Malfoy skins from the Vault.</p><p>Gold and Moonstones are plentiful because you receive some every time you increase your career rank, which happens pretty rapidly. Winged Keys, on the other hand, are more of a grind. And there are two main sources of Winged Keys in Quidditch Champions: the free battle pass-esque Seasonal Rewards track, and daily and weekly challenges.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362833-4362769-harrypotterquidditchchampionsgryffindor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362833" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362833-4362769-harrypotterquidditchchampionsgryffindor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362833"></a><figcaption>Winged Keys can earn you some important items in Quidditch Champions.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362833-4362769-harrypotterquidditchchampionsgryffindor.jpg"></figure><p>The Seasonal Rewards come in the form of a free, 50-tier battle pass which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">features a variety of cosmetics including a Ron Weasley skin</a>. But about half the rewards on the pass are currencies, including 100 Winged Keys across those 50 tiers. But that's just the start of the grind--for every tier you gain past 50, you'll earn 10 additional Winged Keys. You'll earn some XP from playing matches, but the most efficient way is to complete challenges.</p><p>The challenges are small tasks that reward XP for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">battle pass</a> and/or Winged Keys. The current set of daily challenges offer seven Winged Keys in total, and completing every weekly challenge will grant you 41 Winged Keys. The dailies are simple jobs like playing five PvP matches or doing a shovel pass five times, and the weeklies are just longer versions of that same kind of thing.</p><p>Fortunately, you can do these challenges in the offline modes like the campaign as well as in multiplayer PvP, so if you need to get them done quickly you can do so by playing against the computer in Casual mode, which is the easiest difficulty option.</p><p>So if you're grinding for Winged Keys, the daily and weekly challenges are what you need to focus on--you'll get keys for the challenges themselves, and also from the seasonal rewards pass that you'll progress with the XP from the challenges.</p><p>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is developed by Unbroken Studios, and published by Warner Bros.

Anyway, <em>totally </em>unrelated to that factoid, let’s take a look at the first reveal of the new Wolf Man’s design. </p><p>Over at Universal Studios Orlando, the park’s long-running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal%27s_Halloween_Horror_Nights&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal%27s_Halloween_Horror_Nights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween Horror Nights</a></span> event is in full swing. It’s there that the new look of the Wolf Man debuted recently, and the reaction hasn’t been great. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SpeculationMatt/status/1831461327048757433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SpeculationMatt/status/1831461327048757433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the Wolf Man via HHNSpeculationMatt</a></span>, a content creator who covers the spooky event.</p><p>Now, I don’t need to tell you, but this looks bad. The internet is having a field day with the new design, joking about how it doesn’t look like a werewolf and how it’s not very scary, either. </p><p>But a few things to keep in mind: One, this isn’t the actual outfit or costume that will be used in the upcoming film. That movie will likely use a mix of CG and more expensive practical makeup to create its scary werewolf.

It looks more like a cranky old goblin.

<p>Ubisoft has revealed new details on the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown’s Mask of Darkness Story DLC, which will be released on September 17, 2024.</p>



<p><span>The new information came courtesy of a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/gruqIEXvoTx23RRPtHBLJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft blog</a>&nbsp;update, but the TL;DR is that the new DLC is much more than a story expansion, offering players a new biome, traversal elements, traps, enemies, and much more. The blog breaks down the new content coming to the  Mask of Darkness DLC into four different categ</span>ories. You can read the contents below:</p>



<p><strong>Bring Your Skills, Leave Your Powers</strong></p>



<p>If it’s been a while since you’ve played Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, you may want to take some time readjusting to the Metroidvania-inspired adventure’s rhythms (maybe by playing the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6vUaPXscA0o1hzebwa5xcW">Divine Trials</a>&nbsp;that were added in June), because Mask of Darkness expects you to hit the ground running. Available once players have escaped the Depths and acquired the Shadow of the Simurgh time power, Radjen’s Mind Palace is a sizable new area that players can teleport to from a hidden room in Mount Qaf’s Lower City.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While he’s in Radjen’s palace, Sargon plays by Radjen’s rules – and her rules are unfriendly. On entering, Sargon is stripped of all time powers except the Rush of the Simurgh air-dash and Shadow of the Simurgh, which creates copies of Sargon he can teleport to. All of his amulets and healing potions will disappear as well, along with most of his health and arrows.</p>



<p>Don’t worry – you’ll get everything back when you teleport back to Mount Qaf, which you can do from the palace’s central hub room following a brief intro level. You’ll also be able to keep any new amulets you find while exploring the Mind Palace (including Vampiric Chakram, a new amulet that adds a health-stealing area-of-effect attack to Sargon’s chakram). The Mind Palace also has its own potions and Soma Tree flowers (which add to Sargon’s health bar) to discover and earn, so Sargon won’t stay fragile for long – although you won’t get to keep these while exploring the rest of Mount Qaf.</p>



<p><strong>Nimble New Threats</strong></p>



<p>The Mind Palace is a surreal landscape of floating blocks and caverns lit by ghostly white flames, where ashen statues and clumps of dark webbing hide undead soldiers, nimble wraiths, and flying mechanical “saw birds” that spin like buzzsaws with their bladed wings. Mastering the timing of Sargon’s parry is key to dealing with these new terrors; the flying orbs will attack by charging straight at Sargon, and a successful parry will send them hurtling into a wall – or better yet, another enemy – to explode.</p>



<p>The dark wraiths are a little more complicated, especially when you’re facing more than one. They’re able to attack with rapid lunges and kicks that can knock Sargon backward – and one of their favorite moves is to vanish and reappear either behind Sargon, or above him to execute an unblockable dropping attack. Their acrobatic flips can make the timing of their attacks hard to gauge, but their throwing daggers (which they almost always follow with a diving attack) and chakrams (which they frequently throw over Sargon’s head to catch him in the back with their boomerang-like return) can be parried and do considerable damage if Sargon deflects them back at their owners. If they turn red with a glowing symbol above their heads, though, watch out – Sargon’s strikes won’t interrupt their movements or attacks until the effect wears off.</p>



<p>The area of Radjen’s palace we explored is dominated by another creature – a big, spiderlike mechanical monstrosity known as the Sentinel, with two fearsome demon masks for a head and a huge blade in each of its four hands. One mask breathes jets of fire, the other spits projectiles (which you can parry back), and the upper body can separate from its legs, levitate on a pillar of dark energy, and sweep across the room as a seemingly inescapable column. It’s not a true boss encounter, but it sure feels like one.</p>



<p><strong>New Ways to Get Around (and Die)</strong></p>



<p>Each of Mount Qaf’s diverse biomes features new environmental hazards and traversal methods, and the Mind Palace introduces a dozen (about half of which we’ve seen so far). The most ubiquitous additions are floating metal “bumper” orbs that emit plumes of blue energy; strike them in midair, and they’ll chime loudly and launch you in whatever direction those plumes point. Timing your way through sequences of these is a huge part of getting around in Mask of Darkness, but not all of them are usable right away. In fact, if you see any faint amber blobs where an orb should be – or amber barriers covering doors – it’s a sure sign that there’s a floating amber hexagon nearby, blocking your progress. Find it, attack it, and keep chasing it, and eventually its barrier will fall.</p>



<p>Also new are floating vertical pillars that Sargon can climb on and shimmy across to switch sides (which are frequently covered in strategically placed spikes), and massive horizontal pillars carved with beastly faces that steadily shoot cannonballs from their “mouths.” The latter frequently block essential corridors, and getting past them means finding a way to push them back until they break. (Remember what we said above about timing your parries?)</p>



<p>Additionally, you’ll contend with spinning red sawblades that can appear out of thin air and scream toward you with little warning (often while you’re trying to navigate sequences of also-new disappearing platforms). The good news is that these saws telegraph their paths with glowing red lines, giving you a split-second to get out of their way; the bad news is they usually move a lot faster than Sargon does.</p>



<p><strong>Uncover the Enigma of Radjen</strong></p>



<p>Radjen herself – one of Persia’s elite Immortals and a devoted follower of the group’s leader, Vahram – is the malevolent mystery at the core of Mask of Darkness, and her disembodied voice will periodically taunt Sargon as he progresses through her palace. Being inside someone’s mind is a double-edged sword, though, and you’ll be able to discover more about Radjen’s past and motivations by smashing blue crystals hidden throughout the Mind Palace to replay snippets of her memories.</p>



<p>By destroying the corruption at the ends of her deadly obstacle courses, you’ll discover bigger secrets. For example, early in your explorations, you’ll discover a room that reveals a pivotal scene from Radjen’s childhood: Her village was attacked by Kushans (the army the Immortals fought in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown’s opening moments), and her mother was cut down by the game’s first boss, General Uvishka, while helping Radjen and her brother escape. The discovery seems to knock Radjen off-balance just a little – and it’s only the start of what Mask of Darkness has to reveal.</p>

You'll be taken to a new browser tab and asked if you'd like to open Monopoly GO. Do so to receive your free dice rolls in-game. </p><p>Note that you must be at least level 15 and have unlocked the Sticker Album in Monopoly GO to claim any free dice rolls.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links-1725561104888.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Why Isn't My Monopoly GO Dice Roll Link Working?</h2><p>If your Monopoly GO free dice roll link isn't working, it's likely because of one of the two following reasons:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>You've already redeemed that Monopoly GO dice roll link</li><li>The Monopoly GO dice roll link you've clicked on is expired</li></ul><p>You'll know if you've already claimed an active dice roll link if you click on it and your Monopoly GO game displays a pop-up that reads "Sorry. This reward has already been claimed." If you know you haven't claimed a link and you're getting that message, try force-closing the app and opening it again.</p><p>Monopoly GO dice roll links expire frequently and are typically only active for two to three days before expiring so if you've clicked a link and it doesn't work, even after restarting the app, it's more than likely expired and no longer working.</p><h2>How to Get More Monopoly GO Free Dice Rolls</h2><p>Outside of clicking dice links, there are several ways to get more free dice rolls in Monopoly GO:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Daily Treats</strong>: When you log in each day after reaching 25 Net Worth, you can claim Daily Treats, which is essentially a login bonus as a thank you for playing.

If you're lucky, you'll get free dice rolls!</li><li><strong>Automatic Roll Regeneration</strong>: Your dice rolls automatically regenerate over time so if you're out of rolls and can't find ways to earn more, simply wait. Your regeneration amount is dependent on your Net Worth level.</li><li><strong>Completing Albums</strong>: As you play Monopoly GO, you'll collect stickers for your Albums, and you'll get free dice rolls when you complete them. You can also trade duplicate stickers for dice rolls.</li><li><strong>Invite Friends</strong>: If you invite friends to play Monopoly GO, you'll receive free dice rolls as a reward. The more friends you invite (up to 10), the more dice rolls you'll earn.</li><li><strong>Shield Tiles</strong>: If you land on a Shield tile while you've got full Shields, you'll instead receive free dice rolls, the amount of which is dependent on your dice multiplier.</li><li><strong>Quick Wins</strong>: Once you reach 35 Net Worth, you'll unlock Quick Wins, which allows you to complete certain in-game tasks for daily rewards, including free dice rolls.</li><li><strong>Reaching New Boards</strong>: When you complete a board and move onto the next one, you'll receive free dice rolls (and a bunch of in-game money!)</li><li><strong>Participate in Events</strong>: Monopoly GO often has events and participating in them can earn you free dice rolls.</li></ul><p>And, of course, make sure to bookmark this page as we update it frequently with new Monopoly GO free dice roll links!</p><p><em>Meg Koepp is a Guides Editor on the IGN Guides team, with a focus on trends.

Instead, they are just flying around exploring the world and raking in XP along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">The Earthen, the new, Dwarf-like playable race introduced in WoW's recently released The War Within expansion, became playable on September 3 for those who completed the expansion's main storyline and a handful of Earthen-centric side quests. It didn't take long for players to discover that one of the Earthen's passive racial abilities, Wide-Eyed Wonder, can actually be used to level up rather effectively, thanks to its 200% XP bonus for exploring previously undiscovered areas of the game's map.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Normally, players only get a small amount of XP for exploring, with the majority of XP a player earns typically coming from fighting enemies or completing quests. But playing an Earthen increases triples map XP gains, allowing for players to level up with a more pacifist playstyle should they so choose by just flying around and filling out each zone's map.</p><p dir="ltr">A number of players on the WoW subreddit have already done so and reported their findings, with user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f8lmpi/triple_exploration_xp_is_actually_pretty_legit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rykin14</a> saying it took them around eight hours to reach level 71 by exploring. They recommended players looking to do something similar stick to continents like Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, and Draenor when it comes to leveling by exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">While leveling without having to complete quests or fights sounds relaxing, it seems the main downside is that players will have no gear or gold upon hitting higher levels after doing so, since they haven't been completing quests. Thankfully, with The War Within's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">Warbands system</a>, players can easily transfer gold and certain items to other characters on the same account, making leveling via exploration a less-punishing experience at the endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, WoW players have been leveling unconventionally for years. One of the game's most-famous pacifist players, the factionless <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/world-of-warcraft/wows-beloved-pacifist-panda-returns-to-hit-the-war-withins-level-cap-after-10-days-of-picking-flowers-but-not-before-a-rival-did-so-in-1-hour-after-clearing-out-the-mmos-marketplace/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pandaren Neutral Agent</a>, has made a tradition of reaching each new level cap by almost exclusively picking herbs and mining ore. For The War Within, it took Neutral Agent 10 days and 10 hours of playtime to reach the game's new level cap of 80.</p><p dir="ltr">The Earthen might not be the only new playable race to come with The War Within. Players think the mysterious Haranir, which play a relatively small role in The War Within at launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-a-new-playable-race/1100-6522773/" data-ref-id="1100-6522773">might become WoW's next allied race</a>. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review-stay-awhile-and-listen/1900-6418275/" data-ref-id="1900-6418275">WoW: The War Within review</a>, we said WoW's 10th expansion is one of its best, thanks to a new form of endgame content designed for solo players and a greater focus on the MMORPG's story and characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard recently announced The War Within's first major content patch will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">massive 20th anniversary update</a>, one that will bring back the game's most iconic armor sets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/spiders-management-respond-to-strike-negotiations-raising-wages-by-11/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Recently, members of the Spiders game studio spoke out about the mistreatment they were experiencing in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/members-of-spiders-go-on-strike-due-to-issues-within-the-company/">20-page open letter</a> written with the help of a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Open-letter-to-Spiders-management-public-version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Game Workers Union (STJV)</a>. Spiders management has contested these statements, saying they are false and defamatory, potentially damaging the company's interests.</p>
<p>For several months, Spiders' management has consistently discussed negotiations with staff representatives to reach an agreement. However, the dialogue between management and STJV has reached a standstill due to "the radical positions expressed by the STJV." However, today, management gathered all the staff to share the outcome of the discussions and decisions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, wages have been increased. While they received a 6.1% increase in fixed salaries in 2023, new increases will take effect in September 2024. The minimum salary at Spiders was raised by 11%, which did meet the union's request, as the average increase is 3%. Regarding 2025's wages, the negotiations for next year will begin at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Secondly, the agreement between management and the union has established new rules that will apply to most employees and align with the practices that already occur at Spiders. They've stated that "there is no intention to change the working arrangements of employees who are currently working remotely full-time. The management has committed to improving its initial proposal."</p>
<p>In addition to these rules, Spiders' management has announced that they will launch an audit on the working conditions and environment, including an assessment of psychosocial risks. This topic and assessment will be added to the management agenda for the next plenary meeting of the Works Council.</p>
<p>Additionally, management wrote in the statement to remind all Spiders employees that they "are on permanent contracts and that the studio experienced growth in its workforce in 2023, demonstrating its attractiveness within the industry." In 2023, Spiders achieved a score of 94/100 on the gender equality index, with management claiming to ensure that every employee or candidate is treated equally.</p>
<p>To conclude the statement, Spiders management "emphasizes that the working conditions prevailing within the studio do not correspond to the portrayal made by some in the media in an attempt to destabilize the company." According to the statement, the strike call was only followed by a very small minority and in a partial amount. "The management relies on everyone's sense of responsibility to ensure that the quality of dialogue it values and has maintained in the last days is preserved in the future."</p>
<p>Now that Spiders has released this open letter, it remains to be seen whether the union representing the Spiders workers will respond publicly or if they feel that all of their necessary needs have been met.</p>

If the streamer goes live on YouTube or another video streaming platform tomorrow, it will be the first time he’s addressed his audience live since admitting to the allegations against him that came to light in June. </p><p>He earned millions of followers playing <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Warzone</em> while in the persona of an ‘80s action movie anti-hero, which culminated in him winning the vote for Trending Gamer of the year at the 2017 Game Awards. Despite multiple controversies and an at the time mysterious ban from Twitch, Beahm’s popularity continued on YouTube.</p><p>Earlier this summer, however, a former Twitch employee publicly accused the streamer of getting banned for sending inappropriate messages to a minor on the platform. The claim was corroborated by follow-up reporting from <em>The Verge</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, which eventually resulted in Beahm addressing the allegations in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">long statement</a></span> in which he admitted to conversations that leaned “inappropriate” with an underage user, but claimed that nothing illegal had happened.</p><p>Beahm has since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-beahm-twitch-youtube-sexting-ban-1851622149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-beahm-twitch-youtube-sexting-ban-1851622149">deleted that statement</a></span> as his apparent return to streaming gets closer, and largely dismissed ongoing criticism of his past behavior, as he did today when trying to preempt people dunking on him. “WHeRe’s He CoMinG from, Epstein iSlAnd?” he wrote. “iTs a pDf nOt a DoC  hE BloCkEd mE, leT Me TaKe a ScReEnsHot aNd PosT.”</p><p>While some Dr Disrespect fans continue to defend him, his corporate partners have all cut ties, including PC gaming headset sponsors and the video game studio he seemingly co-founded, which recently tried to distance itself from his involvement. And while YouTube did not ban his channel, it did demonetize it, making it impossible for Beahm to continue earning revenue from his massive following on the Google-owned platform. </p><p>If Beahm does return to streaming in some form, it won’t be the first time he’s tried to mount a comeback in the face of controversy.

Often, we’re talking about subscription services such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-netflix-price-hikes-are-only-part-of-the-problem"><u>Netflix</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hulu-and-disney-plus-price-hikes-are-coming-soon-and-subscribers-arent-happy"><u>Hulu, Disney+</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-raises-price-of-playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-across-all-tiers"><u>PlayStation Plus</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike"><u>Xbox Game Pass</u></a>. But we’ve also written about multiple price increases on gaming hardware in recent years. The PS5 pricing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-is-getting-a-price-increase-in-europe-canada-mexico-asia-and-australia"><u>jumped everywhere except the United States in 2022</u></a>, and the Xbox Series X <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-are-about-to-get-a-little-more-expensive"><u>followed suit one year later</u></a>. Now, we’re watching hardware prices rise yet again – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-gets-steep-price-hike-in-japan-sony-confirms"><u>this time on the PS5 in Japan</u></a>.</p><p>Common as it has become to see costs tick up and up this console generation, Sony’s Japanese price hike comes at a surprising time. Rumors have been swirling for months that the company is on the cusp of announcing and releasing an <em>even more expensive</em> console in a PS5 Pro. Assuming those rumors are founded (and they do seem to be), what’s Sony thinking jacking up console prices before releasing something even more expensive? Will ever-increasing sticker prices impact sales of either box?</p><p>Once again, I asked professional analysts to explain the situation. Here’s what I learned.</p><h2><strong>Why did Sony raise the price of the PS5 in Japan?</strong></h2><p>The answer here is a fairly simple one: economics. I spoke to Kantan Games’ Dr. Serkan Toto, Michael Wagner from Newzoo, and Daniel Ahmad from Niko Partners, and all three agreed that the PS5 price increase in Japan isn’t some sort of harbinger of global price increases to come. “Japan is coming out of literally decades of deflation, prices are generally going up for consumer goods over here, and Sony is simply jumping on that bandwagon.“ Toto explained.</p><p>Ahmad offered more detail in a lengthy post on X/Twitter. He noted that since launch, the cost of a PS5 with a disc drive has increased by 60% and the cost of the all-digital edition has increased by 82.5% in Japan.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After its launch in 2020, the cost of a PS5 (Disc) has increased by a total of 60% and the PS5 (Digital) has increased by a total of 82.5% in Japan. </p><p>Sony cites a challenging external environment, including fluctuations in the global economy, for the reason behind the three… <a href="https://t.co/uDT32SjkIp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/uDT32SjkIp</a></p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1828893834891407695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“Sony cites a challenging external environment, including fluctuations in the global economy, for the reason behind the three price increases,” he continued. “Japan is on the extreme end, but other markets have seen 1 or 2 price increases too, which is unique for console hardware. </p><p>“The weakened yen against the dollar is certainly one reason. In 2020, the PS5 launched for what was the equivalent of $480. Today, that would be equal to $345, hence price increases to what is essentially $550.”</p><p>Ahmad added that crackdowns on exports of Japanese consoles to other markets, especially China, was another likely factor.</p><p>As for what this means for everyone else, Toto and Ahmad confirmed that the price increases were likely limited to the Japanese market for the foreseeable future. And while no one was willing to speculate as to whether we’d see a comparable Xbox console price increase in Japan anytime soon (Xbox <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-xs-prices-raised-in-japan"><u>raised the price on the Xbox in Japan already in early 2023</u></a>), Toto and Ahmad both acknowledged that both companies were under economic pressure, and would adjust strategy accordingly.</p><h2><strong>What does this mean for the PS5 Pro?</strong></h2><p>Though there’s been no official announcement yet, there are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know"><u>a lot of good reasons to believe</u></a> a PS5 Pro upgrade of some sort is imminent. The analysts I spoke to are confident, too. Toto in particular said he has “no doubt” a PS5 Pro is coming. And everyone agreed that a PS5 Pro would obviously be priced higher than the current PS5. As Ahmad said:</p><p>"One, production and shipping costs are not declining in-line with previous generations, especially for components such as SSDs. This was especially notable during the early COVID-19 period which severely impacted supply chains and led to shortages for chips, paired with an increase in demand for at-home entertainment, which led to increasing costs. Two, console platform holders are struggling to maintain gross profit margins across the board. This has led to price maintenance (or even price increases in some markets) to ensure hardware remains profitable. Three, the Xbox Series S and PS5 Digital Edition were already sold at a significant loss on day 1. The increased focus on profitability for disc models is to try and offset losses, maintain margins, and weather external factors that may impact spending on games such as cost of living increases."</p><p>But the other two analysts differed slightly on how Sony might make the higher PS5 Pro price palatable. Toto doesn’t believe there will be a price cut on the PS5 base model. “We can expect the PS5 Pro to cost $600 to $650 in the US,” he said. “Now, I am curious what Sony will do in the Japanese market where the current model costs 79,980 yen. For that price, you can get two Switches and almost an additional Switch Lite here. Will they dare to offer the PS5 Pro for 100,000 yen or even more?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I am curious what Sony will do in Japan where the PS5 costs 79,980 yen...Will they dare to offer the PS5 Pro for 100,000 yen?</p></div><p>Wagner has a different take: “While we do not collect revenue on hardware, when the PS4 Pro version came to market, we saw a decrease in the cost of the base model. If a PS5 Pro is on the horizon, we have no reason to believe Sony will change their pricing strategy for this generation.”</p><p>Toto and Wagner also differed in their perspectives on how effective a PS5 Pro release would be for Sony. Both analysts pointed out that its projected timing ahead of the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 would certainly help bolster sales. Toto recalled that by the end of the life cycle, the PS4 Pro accounted for 10-15% of overall PS4 hardware sales. He believes a PS5 Pro can reach the same percentage.</p><p>But Wagner believes that the PS5 Pro “may not move the needle for this generation in the same way that a price decrease in the base model may,” and while GTA 6 might be a hardware sales driver, it might not be as significant as some would expect.</p><p>“We have also shown that many players are playing more mature titles that do not require hardware upgrades (Fortnite, Minecraft, etc.). Due to this, it will be interesting to see how Sony positions a Pro version to drive console sales for players who are not already interested in the base model.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ahmad didn’t explicitly take either position, but he did have an interesting addendum on a different console entirely.</p><p>“It's also worth noting that [a PS5 Pro release] will likely impact the successor to the Nintendo Switch's price in Japan too. As it's unlikely Nintendo will be able to price it as low as the original Switch was at launch.”</p><p>The recent PS5 price increase in Japan may almost certainly be nothing more complex than a reaction to larger economic factors, especially given its limitation to one region and Xbox’s corresponding increase last year. But we’re coming off of a generation of price increase after increase on subscriptions, games, and hardware amid widespread inflation. And with a PS5 Pro seemingly imminent, a Switch successor almost certain <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-it-will-announce-switch-successor-console-within-this-fiscal-year"><u>to follow</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update"><u>whatever Xbox is doing</u></a>, the question of what companies can reasonably ask of consumers for a new game box is becoming an increasingly spicy one.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>A new, more powerful version of the PlayStation 5 is reportedly primed for an announcement soon, and while the rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a> system hasn't been officially confirmed, video game industry analysts are weighing in with their thoughts about it.</p><p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-will-ps5-price-increases-in-japan-impact-the-ps5-pro-price-what-the-experts-are-saying" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that there is "no doubt" that a PS5 Pro is on the way. What form it takes and what upgrades it might offer over the existing PS5 remain a mystery. But it will be more expensive than the PS5, the analysts noted.</p><p>Toto said the PS5 Pro is likely to cost $600 or $650 when it releases, and that the existing PS5, which costs $500, will not receive a price cut. Michael Wagner of Newzoo said history suggests that the PS5 will receive a price cut when the PS5 Pro launches, citing the precedent of the PS4 getting a price cut when the PS4 Pro came out. Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners said this generation isn't the same as past ones in part because production and shipping costs are not declining like they did with previous generations.</p><p>Toto and Wagner also talked about how they believe the PS5 Pro would be released in time for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s debut in 2025, and that PS5 Pro sales could benefit as a result. Toto also mentioned how the PS5 Pro won't be a very significant contributor to overall PS5 unit sales. He noted that the PS4 Pro only made up 10%-15% of total PS4 sales by the end of the platform's lifecycle, and that trend should continue with the PS5 Pro.</p><p>An unsubstantiated rumor suggests the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-coming-this-year-could-be-600-playstation-showcase-in-september-report/1100-6526118/" data-ref-id="1100-6526118">PS5 Pro could be announced during a State of Play this month</a> or even at the Tokyo Game Show, which is also set for this month. Other reports suggest the PS5 Pro was an "open secret" during Gamescom in August.</p><p>Leaked specs for the PS5 Pro suggest it may have a "High CPU Frequency Mode" that reportedly increases the PS5 CPU by 10% to 3.85Ghz. The system could also have a new GPU that is said to be capable of up to 45% faster rendering and dramatically improves ray-tracing effects. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> has also corroborated these claims and posted a list of the reported the PS5 Pro specs back in March.</p><p>Recently, Hideo Kojima's assistant uploaded a photo of Kojima playing Death Stranding 2 with what looks to be a device cloaked under some kind of covering, with many suggesting this might be the PS5 Pro or a developer's version of the system.</p><p>For what it's worth, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-digital-only-mid-gen-refresh-has-been-leaked-in-court-documents/1100-6517813/" data-ref-id="1100-6517813">mid-generation Xbox Series X refresh is also rumored</a>, but there isn't much to go on.

            <p>
Way back in March, Ubisoft's shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">post-launch roadmap</a> for the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and six months later we're almost at its end. Its final content drop - the paid Mask of Darkness story DLC - launches on 17th September, and Ubisoft's has now <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/gruqIEXvoTx23RRPtHBLJ">revealed</a> at least some of what players can expect to see when it arrives.
</p>
<p>
Mask of Darkness introduces a "sizeable" new biome known as Radjen's Mind Palace, promising "fresh traversal elements, traps, enemies, and more". It'll unlock once players have escaped the Depths and acquired the Shadow of the Simurgh time power, meaning players will need to have a decent amount of playtime under their belts before they can get stuck in.
</p>
<p>
Radjen's Mind Palace - a "surreal landscape" of floating blocks and caverns lit by ghostly flame - is accessed by teleporting from a hidden room in Mount Qaf's Lower City. While inside, Sargon is stripped of all his amulets and powers, most of his arrows and healing items, plus all but two of his time powers - the Rush of the Simurgh air-dash and Shadow of the Simurgh.

<p>
That means players will need to get creative when dealing with new enemies including spider-like mechanical Sentinels, spinning birds with bladed wings, and acrobat dark wraiths. As for new environmental hazards and traversal methods, these include bumper-style floating metal orbs that launch Sargon in specific directions when hit, red saw blades that materialise in thin air and hurtle toward his position, plus horizontal pillars that spit out cannonballs.
</p>
<p>
And then, of course, there's Radjen - one of Persia's elite Immortals, who players can learn more about as their journey through her Mind Palace continues.
</p>
<p>
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's Mask of Darkness story DLC launches for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC (via Steam, the Ubisoft Store, and Epic) on 17th September.

            <p>Every week of late I seem to pop up here with another new arcade racer to talk about, and well, I wouldn't want to break the streak. This week's new hotness is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, which is about powersliding around multi-storey car parks and is designed to look like a lost Sega Saturn game. It now has a release date: September 20th.

<p>Chunky polygons? Check. Halftone effects to make those pixels pop? Yep. Anti-aliasing? No way. 
</p>
<p>Set in a future where American parking garages have been, for some reason, turned into race courses, you drift around corners and chain together "Mario Kart-style boosts" to win races and time trials. There are 8 cars to unlock, three car classes of increasing difficulty to drive, and online leaderboards to climb. 
</p>
<p>It's also got online multiplayer for up to 8 players. Most of these arcade racers lack that, favouring split-screen if anything, so for that reason alone I'll give Parking Garage a shot.
</p>
<p>Parking Garage Rally Circuit is mainly the work of indie dev Walaber, a name that caused a sort of cerebral itch when I heard it. That's because he was responsible for a number of beloved early physics games in the '00s, such as JellyCar and Trampoline. Walaber's own site has a <a href="https://www.walaber.com/history">history page that runs down some of his old work</a>.
</p>
<p>My only problem with the look of Parking Garage Rally Circuit so far is that powersliding around parking garages gives me terrible flashbacks to trying to pass the tutorial in Driver one the PSone. Kids these days don't know the terrible shame and anger of renting a game from the video store for two days with your pocket money and spending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iCPzDEkkII">the entire time just trying to get to the first mission</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm sure Parking Garage Rally Circuit won't do me dirty like that. It'll be out  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/">on Steam in two weeks</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And do they ever have a conversation about something other than a man?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Have a conversation with a woman,” reads a prompt that pops up at the start of the clip. “I’m looking forward to speaking to a fellow woman,” says the character on-screen, with the kind of wooden affectation you’d expect from an older video game. Within seconds, she’s beeped at while crossing the street, and realizes it’s a woman driver who’s chastised her. “Hey girl!” she shouts, waving like a broken-down robot. “GLASS CEILING SHATTERED,” the game announcer shouts triumphantly. </p><p>But when the protagonist tries to walk through a door, a warning that it’s a male-dominated space pops up on-screen. “I don’t think I’m supposed to go there,” she says cheerily.<br></p><p>The video then cuts to the “game’s” developers, who—of course—are male. “We wanted to make a game for women, by us,” they say in unison. “Because we had to. Our last game, <em>Jerk It 3: Crankfest 2K24</em> got us in legal hot water—and jail.” Our cheery protagonist then encounters another woman, who says she’s not doing too great because her brother is missing. “Ow,” she says, as the screen flashes red and an alarm wails, indicating she’s taking damage. “Discussing a man,” the game warns. “Tap B to change topic.”<br></p><p>The rest of the video is more of this: pitch-perfect <em>GTA</em> rip-off mixed with searing social commentary. It’s hilarious and one of several video game knock-off videos the NYC comedy duo (composed of Kandel and Joe Miciak) have made, including one based on the FX series <em>The Bear</em>. “<em>The Bear</em> video game actually looks pretty cool,” Kandel wrote in the post sharing the video. I see the pattern.<br></p><p>I reached out to Hotel Art Thief via email to learn about their video game inspiration, what kinds of games they like to play, and to confirm if it was possible to get past that level where two women discuss a man without dying. Here’s what they had to say:</p><p><strong>How did you guys get into making videos like The Bechdel Test game and The Bear game? </strong></p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> We originally got into it with a sketch we did last year called “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@hotelartthief/video/7263466150674091310?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7373464539852244526&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hotelartthief/video/7263466150674091310?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7373464539852244526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user:Brian(box)</a></span>,” which was a retro futuristic VR chatroom. It was our first sketch playing with first person, POV-style comedy in a video game environment, and we liked the immersive feel it allowed. I learned a little bit of Blender to animate it, and we used ambient moments from the N64 game <em>Perfect Dark</em> for the background. We got a kick out of creating a surreal world that combined the absurd with tedium. <em>The Bear</em> was a continuation of that, once I had learned how to animate a little better.<br></p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> For “Bechdel Test,” we had always wanted to do a <em>GTA</em>-like sketch where the character had more mundane objectives, but could still break out a golf club and beat people up. It was just a matter of finding the right home for the idea.<br></p><p><strong>Are you both gamers? What are some of your favorite games?</strong><br></p><p><strong>M:</strong> I’m not much of a gamer. I mostly played <em>Madden, 2K</em>, and <em>Mario</em> growing up. I’m a sore loser and bad at video games, so you can imagine my predicament.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: I’ve played a lot of <em>Smash</em> and <em>Mario Kart,</em> some <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>. I have fond memories of watching my friends play <em>Halo</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> growing up. I’d usually lose or die early and would watch the rest of the game play out like a TV show.</p><p><strong>What games do you find are easy to parody/use as reference in your videos?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: As comedians, we try to choose games and visuals that heighten the idea we’re working with and go from there.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: Yeah, we usually come up with the idea first—like<em> The Bear</em> came about because I liked the idea of a stressful cooking game like <em>Cooking Mama</em> being presented as meditative and calm. And then from the kernel of the idea we look for other ideas from games with similar settings, tones, or characters. Like we got some ideas from<em> Watch Dogs </em>because it was set in Chicago like <em>The Bear.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think about the current state of games? Are you plugged into all the culture warring stuff?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: We are not very plugged into the state of video games.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: I heard things got super egalitarian and no one harrasses anyone anymore.</p><p><strong>How did the women involved feel about the Bechdel Test game?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: I refused to talk to them on set, but maybe Joe knows.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: Mike is kidding!! We had a great day filming with them (Rachel Coster, Danielle Clarke-Fisher, and Whitley Watson). We did a read-through with them to see how it read, and they helped us edit it into a version we were all happy with. Then we recorded all the VO first, which was mostly scripted, but they all improvised and added some great lines. I think a lot of, if not all, the exclamations from Rachel were ad-libbed. Then filming the gameplay outside was a blast. They all coalesced on really funny hand/body movements that looked eerily game-like. We were all pretty tired from filming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1796540383796535339&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1796540383796535339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another sketch</a></span> earlier that day so we moved pretty quickly. All the women loved how it came out, and were thrilled about the reception.</p><p><strong>Tell me more about the expansions and add-ons—they’re obviously for laughs, but they point to how the games industry continues to keep players paying with new content.</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: I’m not a gamer, but just about every media/software company these days will force you to buy a monthly subscription or a never-ending series of add-ons that you don’t even want. We thought having our characters create “feminist” add-ons would be a funny escalation in our sketch.</p><p><strong>What’s the next video game parody you’re working on? </strong></p><p><strong>J</strong>: We haven’t written it yet, but I really want to do a side-scrolling game where you’re navigating through a party where you don’t know anyone.</p><p><strong>M</strong>: We’re actually debuting our next video game parody at our upcoming live show, so we don’t want to spoil too much. But you can come see it September 13th at Union Hall.</p><p><strong>What do you hope people take away from your video game videos?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: I hope people laugh and enjoy themselves.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: I hope people are exhorted to take radical political action. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache miss 2:single/related:cbb18d5f6f88fc5f02ef5e9db73b6690 --><!-- empty -->
<p>LocalThunk, the pseudonymous lead developer of the surprise smash hit deckbuilding/roguelike/poker-math-simulation game <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/"><em>Balatro</em></a>, has long given the impression that he understands that his game, having <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1821184859974344853">sold 2 million copies</a>, might be a little <em>too&nbsp;</em>good.</p>
<p>To that end, LocalThunk has made the game specifically&nbsp;<em>not</em> about actual gambling, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24216323/balatro-update-2025-details-new-jokers-iphone-android-version">or microtransactions</a>, or anything of the kind. Shortly after it arrived in February 2024 (but after it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/steam-next-fest-eight-game-demos-that-stood-out-from-the-crowd/">already got its hooks into one of us</a>), some storefronts removed or re-rated the game on concerns about its cards and chips themes, causing him to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-devs-argue-poker-roguelike-does-not-encourage-gambling-as-it-vanishes-from-some-stores">explain his line</a> between random number generation (RNG), risk/reward mechanics, and actual gambling. He <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/i-hate-the-thought-of-balatro-becoming-a-true-gambling-game-localthunk-is-making-sure-casinos-cant-get-their-hands-on-his-game-even-after-he-dies-by-literally-writing-it-into-his-will/">literally wrote it into his will</a> that the game cannot be used in any kind of gambling or casino property.</p>
<p>So LocalThunk has done everything he can to ensure&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> won't waste people's money. Time, though? If you're a <em>Balatro</em> fan already, or more of a mobile gamer than a console or computer player, your time is in danger.</p>
<p><em>Balatro</em> is coming to iOS, both in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502451661">Apple Arcade</a> subscription and as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502453075">a stand-alone title</a>, and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstack.balatro.android">Google Play Store</a> on September 26. The <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695226886300045">pitch-perfect reveal trailer</a> slowly ratchets up the procrastinatory terror, with the word "MOBILE" punctuating scenes of gameplay, traditional businessmen crying, "Jimbo Stonks" rising upward (Jimbo being the moniker of Balatro's joker), and a world laid to waste by people chasing ever-more-elusive joker combos.</p>

<p>Please note in the trailer, at the 36-second mark, the "Trailer Ideas" for <em>Balatro</em> on Mobile, including "Announcing <em>Balatro</em> is now a Soulslike," "Romanceable Jimbo Reveal," and "It's like that apocalypse movie with the meteor but instead Jimbo is in the sky."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>Playstack</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Even more <em>Balatro</em> content is coming</h2>
<p>The mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is one of three updates LocalThunk has planned for 2025. A gameplay update is still due to arrive sometime this year, one that will be completely free for game owners. It won't feel like a different game, or even a 1.5 version, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24216323/balatro-update-2025-details-new-jokers-iphone-android-version">LocalThunk told Polygon last month</a>, but "extending that vision to, I think, its logical bounds instead of shifting directions … [M]ore about filling out the design space that currently exists, and then extending that design space in interesting directions that I think people are going to love.”</p>
<p>What else is coming? Perhaps "Friends of Jimbo," <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695244007559553">teased today on Balatro's X</a> (formerly Twitter) account, tells us something. Notably, LocalThunk says that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bebf1g/comment/kutxwa3/">he developed the mobile ports himself</a>.</p>
<p>As we noted in our attempt to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">explain the ongoing popularity of roguelike deckbuilders</a>,&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> is LocalThunk's first properly released game. He claims to have not played any such games before making <em>Balatro</em>&nbsp;but was fascinated by streams of&nbsp;<em>Luck Be a Landlord</em>, a game about "using a slot machine to earn rent money and defeat capitalism." That game, plus <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/balatro-dev-gives-look-at-first-prototype-joker-poker">influences of Cantonese game Big Two</a> and the basics of poker (another game LocalThunk says he didn't actually play), brought about the time-melting game as we know it.
</p><p><em>Balatro</em>, in turn, took off with streamers, who would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5lHsMrBFtg">break the game with seeds</a>, hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyaOLqfmJs">scores of 30 quintillion</a>, or just keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFPH7flo-Pw">coming back with everything they've learned</a>.</p>
<p>A number of Ars writers have kept coming back to <em>Balatro</em>, time and again, since its release. It's such a compelling game, especially for its indie-scale price, that none of us could really think of a way to write a stand-alone "review" of it. With its imminent arrival on iPhones, iPads, and Android devices, we're due to re-educate ourselves on how much time is really in each day and which kinds of achievements our families and communities need to see from us.</p>
<p>Maybe the game won't sync across platforms, and the impedance of having to start all over will be enough to prevent notable devolution. Maybe.</p>
