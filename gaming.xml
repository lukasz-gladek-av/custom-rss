            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, a brand new DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>that's launching next month, although the studio is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding what you can expect for now.</p>

<p><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>was announced earlier today via a brand new teaser trailer, and "teaser" really is the word; the trailer reveals the name of the expansion, as well as a C.O.R.E. robot standing in front of some kind of red growth (presumably the Red Strain of the title).</p>

<p>What we do know is that this will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second major story expansion, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em></a>, which introduced a brand new area and other goodies to Rebellion's open-ended shooter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=jb20XuWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=W7D_8oYR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second story DLC, following on from&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While Rebellion hasn't revealed exactly what will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, the studio does say you can expect "a highly confidential new location", as well as "plenty more mysteries to uncover". That sounds about right for an&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>expansion.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-ended first-person shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Sniper Elite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zombie Army&nbsp;</em>studio Rebellion. It's set in a 1960s England that was a lot more heavily impacted by the Windscale nuclear disaster than the one in real life was.</p>

<p>At the outset of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you awaken in a bunker with amnesia, and it's up to you to explore the Windscale plant and its surroundings in order to discover the truth behind Windscale and why a mysterious voice is telling you that a being known as Oberon "must die".</p>




<p>Somewhat unusually for modern games,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>essentially allows you freedom in how you pursue your objectives; you'll have several leads to follow at any given time, and the order in which you chase those leads is largely up to you.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also a day one Game Pass title.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has been holding its Mega-Evolution cards close to its chest leading up to its launch in October, but after the reveals for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682"><span>Dragonite</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>Victreebel</span></a><span>, the floodgates seem to have opened for Game Freak to show off more of the new superpowered forms coming to the RPG. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>isn’t adding any new Pokémon to the Pokédex, but it is going back and giving some underappreciated monsters Mega Evolutions, and Hawlucha, the fighting/flying luchador bird Pokémon from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, is the latest old ‘mon learning new tricks.</span></p> <p><span>Game Freak revealed Mega Hawlucha through an animated short depicting a battle between the bird and a Machamp. The two fighting-type Pokémon meet in a ring alongside their trainers, and Hawlucha plays to the crowd like a real luchador. Then in comes Machamp, who has a dramatic wrestler entrance of its own. The two clash, and it becomes clear that Hawlucha plays up the showmanship to the detriment of its performance in the battle. After Machamp teaches it a lesson in humility, Hawlucha thinks about all the training it took to get to this match and finds the strength to get back up, apologize to its trainer, and mega evolve. Mega Hawlucha gets a new mask and cape, its feathers forming a belt around its waist. It definitely heightens the luchador theme, but it feels a bit more grounded than the mega designs of Dragonite and Victreebel, which lean more fully into a kind of goofy, exaggerated charm. Machamp is no match for Hawlucha after it mega evolves, and the match is over pretty quick. Check out the full animated short below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FULL MATCH: Hawlucha vs. Machamp! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYCOc3SiU7A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Like Draqonite and Victreebel, Hawluche was on the list of leaked Mega Evolutions from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>back in March</span></a><span>, so that list keeps looking more and more credible as time goes on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</span></p>

		<p>Draw Me A Pixel is doing something bold for their second release. After the decidedly un-game-like There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension, the studio has decided to actually make a game this time round. It’s just a damned shame that it’s all gone a bit wrong for release, the review bombing has rolled in, and now Sherlock and Watson are off to solve the mysterious case of the game-breaking missing NPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crushed In Time (Teaser 2025)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSSLM0QBRNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you were to be strict about genre definitions, this would have to be called a point &amp; click adventure, but that really isn’t the half of it. It’s much more of a…. grab and slap? Pull and stretch? Slap and tickle? Probably not the last one. What I mean to say is that instead of the traditional style where you point and things and click on them to move your character over and interact or utter some witty barbs, your cursor is actually the one doing the interacting directly. And that interaction comes in the form of pulling on the elastic scenery and letting loose.</p>


<p>It’s basically the opening screen of Mario 64, shoved into a blender with a point &amp; click game&nbsp;–&nbsp;I cheekily asked if they were fans of this one specific thing and Fred Malavasi, associate producer and comms manager, replied “As a child, I spent hours [playing with] Mario’s face. So yeah, definitely!” –&nbsp;and it manifests in some truly wonderful ways through the opening scene. </p>
<p>It’s a regular day on Baker Street when a repeated pounding on the front door summons Watson to answer, but as he opens it, the presumed postman grabs him for a hug and hands him a letter. Weird, but OK. Time to deliver that to Holmes, but Watson is himself now stuck pounding on the locked door to Sherlock’s apartment. </p>


<p>Now it’s over to you to figure out how to resolve this issue. Mousing around the screen, you can click and grab any part of it, pull it and release for a little bit of enjoyable wobble, but you’re really searching for the white dots to actually interact with. This won’t necessarily be the direct solution, of course, but rather provides the framework of the puzzle you need to complete. </p>
<p>You see, the door knob won’t open the door, and instead plings down onto the floor, letting you then grab it again, pull and launch it in an arc to get across the room and slot into the hole on a drawer, which in turn will release a telephone cord for you to plug in and trigger a call to wake Holmes up. There’s all the hallmarks of a point &amp; click puzzle here, but how you’re finding and giving the solution is just so thoroughly different. </p>
<p>That persists as you go through the successive puzzles in this introduction as things start to get even more unusual. You see, that letter Watson holds suddenly defies gravity and flips up to the ceiling. How do you get it down? Well, it’s obviously some kind of combination of honey, dumb waiter and portraits of the queen, but once again, you’re grabbing things, flicking them around and seeing what works. Holmes, the rather stubborn ass, just considers all of these bizarre occurrences to be a part of his own brilliance, completely oblivious to your unknowable force and inputs. </p>

<p>Getting stuck is a natural part of the genre, as obscure solutions to strange situations stump you and hold up your progress. Fred confirms that “We have two types of hints. The first one is you just have to look around and maybe listen to what characters are saying. But the second one, we are definitely going to have a real hints system. I can’t say exactly what right now, but there will be a hints system like in every point &amp; click game.”</p>
<p>There’s three different styles of action that Draw Me A Pixel use through this into: grabbing to stretch and release, grabbing to release and eject, and grabbing and then spinning something round. I’ve no doubt that there’s more than these three, and there’s a bunch of snippets found within the teaser trailer. </p>
<p>But what was that about a buggy, review-bombed game release? Well, hopefully the actual game won’t have a troubled launch, but the narrative is that the in-game Draw Me A Pixel has released this buggy mess. As they set off from Baker Street in the Sherlock-o-motive (it’s a car), Holmes and Watson don’t realise that they’re going to be on a time-travelling adventure, of sorts, that delves back through and explores their game in different iterations. Expect to see prototypes, alpha versions and lots of other quirky stuff, likely leaning back into some of the shenanigans that were seen in There Is No Game. </p>

<p>Crushed In Time looks like a truly unique and exciting riff on the point &amp; click adventure, with its truly inventive grabbing and elastic mechanics. If you like the genre and have a barmy sense of humour, this should absolutely be on your watch list for 2026.</p>

<p>Ahhh, memories</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>XSEED Games has announced that it's bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_memories_of_celceta">Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</a> to Switch in the West in early 2026.</p>
<p>In case you missed this one, Revelations in Celceta enhanced port of the PlayStation Vita game (which later came to PC and PS4) <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/ys_memories_of_celceta">Ys: Memories of Celceta</a>. Can you see <em>why</em> they changed the name? Memoire: Memories is a bit of a mouthful... well, Falcom kept it for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/ps-vitas-ys-memoire-memories-of-celceta-lands-switch-remaster-in-japan-this-may">Japanese release in May 2025</a>. So, y'know.</p>
<p>Anyway, Revelations in Celceta is actually the <em>true</em> fourth game in the Ys series; Falcom originally outsourced development of a fourth game to two seperate companies in the early '90s, which in turn gave us two different <strong>Ys IV</strong>s. Timeline wise, it takes place directly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X</a> — which is also getting a rerelease in 2026 on Switch 2.</p>
<p>This rerelease will allow you to swap between the original soundtrack and a brand new, rearranged version. And, from the look and sound of it, that seems like the main addition.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the action RPG from XSEED, along with some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</em></strong> Key Features</p>
<p><strong>- Exhilarating Party-based Action:</strong> Strategic party battles challenge players to change their tactics on the fly, and allies can pick up new abilities in the midst of battle that can help them gain the advantage against powerful enemies.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Exploration of a Dangerous Land:</strong> Celceta is a vast and mysterious land, filled with interesting people and thrilling adventures. Players can take advantage of a robust mapping system as they discover all the challenges and rewards that await.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Enhanced Musical Experience:</strong> The sweeping score guiding Adol’s journey through Celceta returns, along with a newly recorded, re-interpreted version, allowing players to choose their own auditory adventure.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So, we don't have too long to wait. Oh, and if you want to catch up on your Ys, this is the second game in the Memoire project — which is porting the older games to Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_the_oath_in_felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a>, which launched earlier this year, is a fantastic place to start.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Revelations in Celceta in the comments</em>,</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-hawlucha-officially-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a.1282863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new Mega Evolution for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and unlike the last two reveals, this one is a bona fide Generation VI native.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">set to launch on October 16th</a>, and the first major new Mega Evolution revealed for the game was Dragonite, with Grass/Poison-type plant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">Victreebel following earlier this month</a>. Be sure to check out Mega Victreebel's horror-inflected announcement trailer if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Now, a brand new Mega Evolution has been revealed for the game, and it's none other than the Fighting/Flying-type luchador bird Hawlucha, which will transform into an even more magnificent form if you choose to Mega Evolve it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=kSFPRTR0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=xl4KvUbx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hawlucha is the latest Pokemon to get the Mega Evolution treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer in which Mega Hawlucha is revealed is a pretty heartwarming one; the luchador steps into the ring with Machamp, and the latter proves to be a tough opponent until Hawlucha draws on its memories of its trainer and steps it up a notch.</p>

<p>I would say that I won't spoil what happens next, but given that this is a trailer specifically announcing the existence of Mega Hawlucha, I'm sure you can put two and two together. Suffice it to say Hawlucha's trainer is delighted with the outcome.</p>

<p>You can check out the full trailer announcing Mega Hawlucha below; it essentially takes the form of a full wrestling match between the two Pokemon, complete with the kind of dramatic twists and turns you'd expect from a WWE bout.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is set to debut on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-2533423.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original Switch</a> on October 16th. Set entirely in Lumiose City in the Kalos region, the game sees players undertaking an urban redevelopment project by day and participating in an exciting battle tournament by night.</p>

<p>The game will also feature a more action-oriented battle system that will require players to physically dodge certain moves, as well as a number of new Mega Evolution forms, of which we've only seen a few. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-hollow-knight-before-silksong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-you-need-to-play-hollow-knight-before-silksong.1282854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you like games, you’ve probably heard the name Hollow Knight: Silksong at some point. Its disappearance into the seemingly abyss following its 2019 announcement was curious. Thankfully, it resurfaced in 2025, it’s coming out this year, and we’re here to let you know if you need to play the first game beforehand.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is a direct sequel to 2017’s Hollow Knight</a>. The Knight has stepped aside in the new game so that Hornet can take center stage. If you’re a newcomer to the series, this all might sound more foreign than if I’d written this in an alien-like language. </p>



<p>This guide is to help you if you’re not well-versed in the Hollow Knight world. You should be excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a>, and you should have all the details ahead of its long-awaited release.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-i-play-hollow-knight-before-hollow-knight-silksong">Should I Play Hollow Knight Before Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’re having fun either way. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It is not essential or a requirement for you to play Hollow Knight before Silksong, but I recommend you do so, as it will help you to appreciate Silksong’s improvements and new content.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Silksong</a> puts you in the shoes of Hornet—a prevalent character in Hollow Knight. By playing the original, you get to understand Hornet’s roots better, how she ties into the world, and why we’re suddenly controlling her instead of The Knight.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has said that Silksong will be a good introduction for new players. It’s a different world with fresh mechanics, but Silksong still has basic tutorials and pointers on how to get started. There will be plenty of first-time players and consumers of Hollow Knight media likely following the hype train.</p>



<p>What I will say is that Silksong was originally planned as DLC for Hollow Knight. So you get the sense that this is a genuine continuation of the world that came before. All things considered, <strong>I recommend you sink a few hours into Hollow Knight before Silksong</strong> to become acquainted with the world, movement mechanics, and the vibe of the franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-worth-playing-in-2025">Is Hollow Knight Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight is 100% still worth playing in 2025, as it’s considered one of the all-time great indie games and is still incredibly fun to play nearly 10 years later.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, Silksong is a new chapter in Hollow Knight. New abilities, new bosses, new biomes, and much more. Playing Hollow Knight means you get to enjoy and appreciate the foundation laid down before Silksong; you get to experience boss fights you would miss out on otherwise, and even small details, such as backgrounds and the soundtrack, need to be enjoyed and savored.</p>



<p>When you think of the Metroidvania genre, or find anyone’s ‘best Metroidvania games of all time’ list, Hollow Knight will be on it. Do yourself a favour and find time to play it—even if it’s only after Silksong.</p>



<hr>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> is the ideal place to share your favorite Hollow Knight memories, stories, and theories. I recommend you go there to help out newcomers and open up deep conversations with long-time fans.</p>



<p>You should also read about whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-physical-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong will have a physical release</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-hollow-knight-silksong-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it has Early Access</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-platforms-ps5-xbox-pc-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all platforms</a> the game’s coming to.</p>

                <p>What's the most important thing that EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/">Skate</a> game needs? Contrary to popular belief, polished gameplay and fun environments aren't at the top of the list, because that's a spot reserved for the soundtrack. If we're talking sub-genres within the playlist itself, then naturally, we have to know just how much of it is reserved for the <em>best </em>music to power a kickflip: ska. So just how much ska is in Skate? That's a question Skate's developers aren't quite ready to answer yet, although they are tooting their horns about the game's upcoming release on PC and console.</p><p>"I know ska is really polarising. I love Ska, I love Rocksteady (another genre of music), so I don't know how to answer this. I'm also bad at math, so I'm going to say it won't be a high percentage but I won't rule out ska being on the soundtrack," senior creative director Deran Chung said to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/i-asked-the-skate-devs-how-much-ska-is-in-eas-new-open-world-game-and-they-laughed-at-me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>. Skate head of creative Jeff Seamster added that the game definitely features "some" ska, which might be reason enough to grab your old Mighty Mighty Bosstones T-shirt out of your cupboard and dust off your Reel Big Fish CDs.</p>

		<p>NetEase’s spin-off from Bungie’s Destiny universe has launched today on mobile and PC. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising/">Destiny: Rising</a> is a brand new game set in an alternate universe to the main Bungie titles but retains everything that makes the series popular.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3JJKAc-C8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I have been playing the game for a couple of hours using the Mumu emulator for PC –<a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/"> something NetEase actively encourages</a> –&nbsp; and I have to say it’s rather good. It’s Destiny, but all brand new. New characters,. supers, weapons, locations, missions, basically everything everyone has been screaming at Bungie to add to Destiny 2. The only major difference so far is you have two weapons rather than three.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a full report on the game when I have played some more and have reached any monetisation barriers.</p>
<p>The alternate timeline is set in a period way before the setting familiar to those who have played the main Destiny Games, dated before the Last City has been built. Players take control of various characters from a roster that will keep growing, but they will not be based on the classes of Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. Instead the characters have their own abilities. Some of the characters players will get to use include Ikora Rey, Iron Lord Jolder, and Kabr. The main protagonist is a character called Wolf that players can&nbsp; to customise.</p>

<p>The first Season, named Daybreak, will be launching “soon”, no exact date has been given.</p>
<p>The recommended specs and devices include:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Android Devices:</u>&nbsp;Snapdragon 845 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPhone:</u>&nbsp;iPhone 8 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPads:&nbsp;</u></li>
<li>iPad (8th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (10.5-inch)（2017） or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (11-inch, 1st generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad mini (5th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Air (3rd generation) or newer</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can just fire up the <a href="https://www.mumuplayer.com/">Mumu emulator</a> and play it on your PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-is-cheaper-than-buying-office-alone-amazon-clears-out-stock-for-labor-day.1282818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It doesn’t often happen that Amazon’s best-sellers list puts a budget Windows laptop next to high-end MacBook Airs, but that’s what’s happening right now. There’s an HP 14-inch model (Intel Celeron N4020, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB Storage) that has quietly become a serious player on the platform as one of the best-selling laptops on the site, and the reason why is simple: it’s awfully cheap.</p>
<p>With the ongoing Labor Day sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">you can get it for $172 down from its usual $230</a>. At that price, it’s one of the cheapest brand-new laptops you’ll find anywhere, and it’s less than some headphones or tablets.&nbsp;The deal becomes even harder to pass up when you factor in it also <strong>includes a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365</strong> which alone usually costs $129 (per year). And since that comes bundled for free, you’re essentially paying close to the value of the software and getting a full-sized laptop in exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Buy It</h2>
<p>The screen itself is a 14-inch HD micro-edge bezel panel that boasts a slim design that doesn’t scream “budget.” It’s not too small for Netflix sessions or working on documents, and its size sits comfortably in the sweet spot between being travel-friendly and being productive. The laptop is also easy to carry around thanks to a thin build and light weight which is convenient if you’re going to class or a local coffee shop.</p>
<p>The machine runs on <strong>Intel’s Celeron N4020 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage</strong>. It’s not built for heavy creative projects or gaming, but that isn’t what this computer is meant for. Instead, it’s built to give you coverage for normal things such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, email or Zoom meetings. The storage might feel tight compared to higher-end models, but remember—Microsoft 365 allows you to access OneDrive cloud storage which means you can keep your most important files online and free up space on the device.</p>



<p>Battery life is always something to watch out for with cheaper laptops, but HP has managed to keep it respectable here: You’ll have hours of use out of one charge, which should be <strong>sufficient to get you through a school day</strong> or long study session. Add in <strong>preinstalled Windows 11 Home</strong>, and you’re receiving the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system with periodic updates, all for the cheap price.</p>
<p>At $172, this HP laptop is precariously close to “why not?” territory.</p>

                <p>Activision has brought Call of Duty: World War II back to the Microsoft Store and Xbox PC App after it was removed more than a month ago, though the company has still not said a word about what happened.</p><p>A statement released on August 27 confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1960760388221640812" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 2017 game has returned</a>, and is once again available for PC Game Pass players. However, there was no explanation as to anything else related to the game's removal on July 4. At the time, Activision said it pulled the game to investigate "an issue."</p><p>While Activision never confirmed what happened, fans believe they worked it out. Call of Duty: WWII was reportedly overrun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-wwiis-game-pass-pc-version-was-pulled-reportedly-after-hacking-issues/1100-6532997/" data-ref-id="1100-6532997">Remote Code Execution attacks</a> that had players losing control of their PCs via a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p>Activision makes a point to not discuss Call of Duty security issues, saying that disclosing information about its security protocols would only help bad actors get a leg up to create new workarounds and exploits. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-rampant-cheating-activision-finally-responds/1100-6528903/" data-ref-id="1100-6528903">fight against cheaters and hackers is never-ending</a>, Activision has said.</p><p>The issue with Call of Duty: WWII was specific to the PC edition; the Xbox version on Game Pass was never removed after it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/" data-ref-id="1100-6532845">launched into Game Pass at the end of June.</a></p><p>Call of Duty: WWII was developed by Sledgehammer Games and was notable at the time in part for being the first fully WWII-set Call of Duty game since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Some of its most memorable missions including the Saving Private Ryan-like D-Day opening sequence and a mission where you go undercover in a German building in Paris featuring some tense moments.</p><p>You play as Ronald "Red" Daniels, with supporting squadmates including soldiers voiced by people like Josh Duhamel, Jeffrey Pierce, Jonathan Tucker, and Brett Zimmerman. The campaign's intensity is ramped up by the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2-ditching-health-regen-has-some-fo/1100-6449627/" data-ref-id="1100-6449627">there is no automatic health regeneration.</a></p><p>The next Call of Duty game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>. Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">canceled the game's Carry Forward program</a>, meaning operators and skins from Black Ops 6 will not be available in Black Ops 7. Activision also acknowledged the fan feedback that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=activision+acknoowledges+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=activision+acknoowledges+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABjvBTIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIKCAQQABiiBBiJBTIKCAUQABiABBiiBDIGCAYQRRhA0gEINTMxMWowajmoAgawAgHxBUiXjwJeshBt&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty has strayed from its identity</a> as a military shooter. Many took this to be a reference to the franchise's wacky skins, but the company did not mention this outright.</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43834270dc9bd/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like many first-party Nintendo games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is absolutely stuffed with fun little details and easter eggs.</p>
<p>Some are pretty obvious, like the short challenge level that's basically a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, but others take a little more time and patience to notice. For example, you might be so busy smashing up the environment to even clock on that Pauline's idle animation actually changes throughout the game.</p>
<p>We mentioned this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, but it's such a small little detail and it can easily be missed if you're too busy having fun. Essentially, though, as Pauline gets more comfortable in the presence of Donkey Kong, her mood will begin to lighten. So she'll go from looking worried to playfully ruffling DK's fur, and even going so far as to tickle him. It's adorable!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4xugmit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It just goes to show the care and attention that Nintendo gives to its creations, lending real authenticity to DK and Pauline's growing friendship throughout the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>S-Game's Phantom Blade Zero made more than a few heads turn when it was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">2023</a> with its haunting dark setting and intense action gameplay. The game looked so nice that many believed the trailer wasn't a proper representation of the experience, myself included, but every doubt I had about what looked like yet another soulslike were completely squashed last year when I had the chance to try out a few slices of the game during <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Gamescom 2024 </a>focused on extremely satisfying combat and action gameplay whose best qualities managed to shine through even in a version of the game that was clearly rather far from release. And although I felt combat was great, I couldn't help but wonder how the rest of the experience would shape up.</p>



<p>An answer to this question arrived during this year's Gamescom, when I was given the chance to try out two different demos of the action game in development by S-Game. Both demos, an earlier demo available during a press-only event held by NVIDIA one day before Gamescom began, and the one that attendees could try out themselves after braving some of the longest lines I have seen during the show, featured more of the incredible combat showcased in the game's first public demo, but also exploration and traversal to round up the experience.</p>



<p>In this regard, it definitely feels like Phantom Blade Zero will deliver as much as it does for combat. Both locations, with a clear eastern feel, sported an intricate linear design with tons of different paths where items and optional enemies could be found, alongside some NPCs who provided some additional information on the current state of things. Exploring these locations completely will require players to take advantage of Soul's impressive agility and some tools, which feel great to use thanks to the incredible animation work based on motion capture. Better yet, using all of Soul's traversal abilities and tools feels incredibly intuitive to use, making exploration as engaging as combat.</p>

<p>Although I already have found the game's combat incredibly engaging without being unfairly challenging last year, I couldn't help but notice how Phantom Blade Zero has been significantly improved in this regard since last year. The final game will feature a vast selection of weapons, and although only a small portion of them were available in the Gamescom demo, it was easy to tell how much care S-Game is putting into making each one better suited for different playstyles and enemies. Secondary weapons, for example, range from long-range weapons to heavier hitting melee weapons, and the ability to switch between two different main and secondary weapons on the fly not only allows for plenty of flexibility, but it's an actual game mechanic that players should use to extend their combos as much as possible once an enemy is left staggering after depleting some sort of posture gauge with attacks and proper parries. As such, fighting enemies is downright satisfying, as the game requires alternating between different offensive and defensive like in the best character-action games, but without being extremely punishing in the vein of games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, at least at normal difficulty.</p>



<p>The highlight of the Phantom Blade Zero Gamescom 2025 demo were, unsurprisingly, the boss battles. The fight against the massive Wan Jun was intense but easily manageable after a few tries, especially once I had a better grasp of the many abilities at Soul's disposal, which require resources to further extend combos performed by alternating light and heavy attacks. The fight against the Disciples of the Seven Stars was similarly easily manageable after a few tries, but it was considerably more stunning to experience, thanks to the aforementioned amazing animation work and combat design, which provides Soul with all the tools to deal with multiple enemies at once in spectacular fashion.</p>



<p>Speaking with an S-Game representative during my playthrough of the Phantom Blade Zero, the game has been defined as a Soulslite, which I have found to be an apt description of a game that takes the best features of modern action games and action role-playing games to offer an intense experience that is as pleasing to the eye as it is incredibly fun to play. Thankfully, we may not have to wait much longer to learn when Phantom Blade Zero will launch on PC and consoles, as I have been told a release date will be announced soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-set-for-november.1282791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netmarble has announced the release date for upcoming anime action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which, contrary to what you might think from the title, is not the same game as mobile gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>.</p>

<p>First revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox showcase back in June</a>,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC on November 17th, with a current-gen console version due to follow sometime next year (although not for Switch 2, unfortunately).</p>

<p>Despite what the name might have you believe,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>has nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>; Netmarble says it's an "entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-steps.jpg?itok=IZY8clYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-steps.jpg?itok=XljdX6pU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to come to PC in November.</figcaption></figure><p>It sounds like <i>Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</i>won't be a gacha game, either; according to development producer Kim Gwang-Hoon, there will be no "randomness when recruiting Hunters or crafting weapons", allowing players to "feel a true sense of achievement" through "effort and strategy".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to use boss materials in order to craft weapons, so there won't be any kind of gacha mechanic for obtaining those materials or for crafting the gear you can get from them either, it seems.</p>

<p>You can also expect sharper controls than&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>, as well as higher-fidelity backgrounds that Kim Gwang-Hoon says will "bridge the gap between comic and realism". The backgrounds are still based on the original&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling&nbsp;</em>webtoon, though, so you'll recognize them if you're a fan.</p>

<p>If you want to see&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>in action, then you can check out Netmarble's new release date trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9MVHCQ7CJX01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox app</a> on November 17th. A version of the game is also due for release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2026, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <p>You know when you're friends with three people, then one of them suddenly pulls a Robbie Rotten and morphs into a real villain who terrorises your existence? No? Just me then, and also the protagonist of Ken Levine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, whose main foe you'll get to dictate the identity of through your actions in the game.</p>
<p>It happens via a villainy system, which Levine and the crew at Ghost Story Games discuss in the first ever Judas dev log they've just put out. We've only seen this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-was-basically-a-corridor-says-ken-levine-judas-wont-be-and-characters-will-have-long-memories">non-corridory</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a>-like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-has-reactive-difficulty-evil-dentist-chairs-and-a-giant-robot-dog-for-fast-travel">evil dentist chairs</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-latest-gameplay-still-looks-a-lot-like-a-sci-fi-bioshock-now-with-evil-brum-and-a-robot-chef">evil Brum</a> in spits and spurts since the announcement in 2022. This looks to the first sign of more regular updates in the offing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'd already heard a bit about the 'big three', a trio of key characters who'll be key to your adventures aboard the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. In this <a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">dev log</a>, Levine and co reveal that they've got some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> nemesis system-inspired stuff going on.</p>
<p>Basically, rather than having a traditional baddie who's nailed on as being your foil from the get go - à la BioShock's Frank Fontaine - you'll start off as mates with the big three. How you play the game and the choices you make'll influence how much they like you, leading to one eventually deciding they're no longer your mate and becoming the game's villain. Or, as Levine puts it:</p>
<blockquote>In Judas, you're going to get to know these characters intimately. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you've got to decide who you trust and who you don't.</blockquote>
<p>He also adds that the trio will judge you as you play, including "how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting". No, please, don't hate me just because I'm shite at resource management and keep running away from fights like a coward, Judasers! Whichever of them ends up being en-baddieised gets "a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals", with the example given being a character called Tom turning previously recruitable sheriff bots against you.</p><p>It sounds like it could be cool, but I worry players who've tried their best to keep all three happy will find it incongruent when one of them turns bad, because the game's reached the point when it's decided it needs a baddie in place. Or, conversely, be railroaded into setting off a villain arc in a manner that might feel forced. There's also the matter of whether a baddie whose very baddieness relies on responding to player actions will be able to muster motivations and personality traits as in-depth as a character who's built to be a baddie from the ground up. To me, there's potentially a danger of blunting the story a bit in favour of making it more reactive, something that can be to a game's detriment.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see how Judas tackles all of that. As of this dev log, it's still got no release date, with Levine explaining the team don't want to reveal one just to have to change it later. There's at least some key art by American movie poster artist Drew Struzan to stare at while we wait.</p>

              <p>Over the past few years, Apple hasn’t really been hiking prices – in fact, in some cases it’s been doing the opposite. The MacBook Air is a perfect example, and it got more affordable since Apple introduced its own chips. What was once a laptop that never, ever went on sale is now showing up more and more in big Amazon sales.</p>
<p>This Labor Day, it takes it to the next level with the brand-new 2025 MacBook Air falling to an all-time low. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage falls to $799, from a full $200 off its normal $999</a>. The higher-end ones with bigger storage and RAM are also heavily discounted but this model is the one that’s technically fallen to an all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Laptop</h2>
<p>The MacBook Air’s draw has always been combining power, portability and battery life, but <strong>the 2025 version does it even better thanks to the new M4 chip within</strong>. The processor is designed with Apple Intelligence in mind so it’s <strong>optimized to handle future AI features</strong> that will be introduced across macOS and the remainder of Apple’s platform. More importantly for day-to-day use, the M4 makes every task faster and smoother: If you’re looking for a laptop that can manage both the basics and more demanding tasks without slowing down, this deal puts that capability within reach at an affordable price.</p>
<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is still one of the best features of the MacBook Air: With its precise bright colors, sharp resolution, and broad color gamut coverage, it’s a monitor for anyone from a student to a professional. Watching movies, photo editing, or simply typing reports feels more real and comfortable on a display like this. The thin bezels give a streamlined look, and True Tone adapts the color temperature to your environment.</p>



<p>Priced at around 2.7 pounds and measuring less than half an inch, MacBook Air lives up to its name: It fits into any bag and it’s easy to tote around all day. Even with that thin design, it doesn’t cut corners on connections or sound. You still get a pair of Thunderbolt ports, a MagSafe charging port, a headphone jack and a surprisingly deep speaker system for a laptop of this thickness.</p>
<p>Apple has also raised the bar on video calling with a 12MP front camera that includes Center Stage which is a feature that ensures you’re always front and center during a call. And with studio-quality mics and improved speakers, the Macbook Air is prepared for work calls as well as family video calls. For security and ease of use, Touch ID is built into the keyboard so you can unlock the machine or confirm purchases instantly.</p>
<p>Naturally, battery life remains one of the primary points of appeal. <strong>Apple claims the new MacBook Air will last up to 18 hours on a single battery,</strong> so you can get through a full day of classes, meetings, or travel without having to plug in. That combination of power and thrift is exactly why this line has been so adored.</p>
<p>If you’d been waiting for a good reason to finally splurge on the MacBook Air, this Labor Day sale makes it an easy call.</p>

We have known this for a while, of course, but it looks like TCG fans in select regions will have to wait a little longer before they can get their hands on the upcoming creatively-titled 'Mega Evolution' set, as The Pokémon Company has announced a delay.</p>
<p>In a statement on the Pokémon TCG UK <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGUK/status/1960689456857456667">Twitter</a> account, the company revealed that the set has been "slightly delayed in EMEA markets" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), citing "challenges impacting product delivery dates".

<p>The region specification has us assuming that the expansion will still arrive in other regions as planned on <strong>26th September</strong>, but we'll be sure to keep you updated should we hear any changes.</p>
<p>Here's The Pokémon Company's full statement, followed by the initial tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to challenges impacting product delivery dates, the release of the upcoming Pokémon Trading Card Game: Mega Evolution will be slightly delayed in EMEA markets.<br>
We apologise to our fans and understand that this news may be disappointing. We are working hard alongside our logistics partners to ensure products will be available for purchase from 10th October 2025. We would like to thank our community for their continued support and patience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a reminder, the Mega Evolution set includes almost a dozen Mega Evolution ex cards and over 50 Pokémon and Trainer special illustration cards. In short, there's a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>Alongside this set, Mega Evolution will also be making its grand return in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it'll be allowed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, <em>and</em> it's arriving in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> in the Fall.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>studio Crystal Dynamics has announced that it's been hit by layoffs, but the developer says that work on the next game in the aforementioned action-adventure series remains "unaffected".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on LinkedIn, Crystal Dynamics says it has "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of [its] talented colleagues", blaming "evolving business conditions" for the decision. The studio stops short of revealing how many employees have been let go.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics goes on to say that while its decision was not "made lightly", it was "necessary...to ensure the long-term health of [the] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=a9edtL6I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=9WvQuSUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crystal Dynamics has been hit by layoffs, but&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is "unaffected", the studio says.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Crystal Dynamics thanks its "teams, players, and partners" for helping it to "build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow". That, the studio says, "includes the future of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, which remains unaffected" by the layoffs.</p>

<p>It's been five years since Crystal Dynamics' last original game, namely 2020's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvels-avengers-ending-development-support" rel="nofollow">ended service in January 2023</a>. Other than that, the studio has also worked alongside Aspyr on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered" rel="nofollow">remasters</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">first six</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">first two titles</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series is in development, although Crystal Dynamics and publisher Amazon Games have revealed nothing about the new project yet. It's likely to be a while before we learn exactly what direction the studios intend to take with the property in future.</p>

<p>Still, even without a flagship game announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>franchise remains active. Last year, an animated series by the name of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&nbsp;</em>debuted on Netflix, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">live-action series is also in the works</a>.</p>




<p>Crystal Dynamics' decision to lay off employees may well be connected to the fact that in July, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">canceled its&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development studio alongside The Initiative.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> is still trying to fix up those gosh-danged Age transitions. For those just joining us, when you move between Ages in Firaxis's latest historical map-painter, it's sort of like starting over. You're asked to pick a new Civilisation, appropriate to the Age, and your units will be reshuffled, downgraded and, in some cases, deleted like rabid dogs. The game also runs a broom over the geography, rearranging all the resources. </p>
<p>It's supposed to be a pace-changer, and as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-civilization-players-dont-finish-a-single-game-going-by-civ-6-data-and-perhaps-thats-the-best-way-to-play">a notorious earlygame drop-out</a>, I can certainly see the logic behind that, but the feature has riled a lot of antique Civvers up. Firaxis have tweaked the Age system extensively post-launch, but many recent Steam reviews still list it as a downside. This week, they rolled out yet another patch, while detailing plans for a new approach to Age transitions that is actually "harsher" than the original. It's a bold (4X) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> (game), Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for them.
</p>
<p>A quick recap: Firaxis have previously introduced an Age transition impact setting, letting players choose between having the game gather up your units between transitions, as in the original design, and a new "continuity" option that retains their map locations. 
</p>
<p>"Continuity Mode is a nice way to allow players less disruption to their military campaigns if they like to be fighting continuously from one Age to the next," explains Ed Beach, creative director. "I don't use that setting often in my games, but I did enjoy it recently when I played a full campaign with Genghis Khan as my leader." I do love the concept of Genghis Khan's quest for world domination getting repeatedly reset by a bunch of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01916599.2024.2373542#abstract">bullshit periodisation</a>. Naughty rampaging warlords! We'll stop-start the WAAAAGH right out of you.
</p><p>Much as Beach enjoys the new setting, he feels Firaxis erred in making it the new default while hiding the previous "Regroup" option in the advanced settings. This made it easy to forget which kind of transition you have enabled. As such, the latest patch on Steam and the Epic Games Store makes your choice of Age transition setting "sticky" between campaigns, together with game speed and difficulty. 
</p>
<p>Even as they soften the workings, however, Firaxis are devising another, "harsher" version of Regroup, "a setting we are tentatively calling Collapse". There are no details as to why this is "harsher", but "Collapse" implies further unit loss and degradation, I guess. Perhaps it'll be a kind of "Dark Age" mechanic. "It's still early in testing, and we'll need time to see if it feels fun and fits well into the game," Beach says. "If it does, we'll look into when it might make sense to include it in a future update."
</p>
<p>That's not all they wrote. The <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">full patch notes for Civilization 7 update 1.2.4</a> also mention a few bug fixes, but none of these seem as momentous to my eye as the on-going Age discourse. Are you still playing? Have your feelings changed much since launch?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 is the turn of Hornet in Hollow Knight: Silksong. A new character and setting have raised questions about Hollow Knight: Silksong and its sequel or prequel status, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is real, Hollow Knight: Silksong is happening, and Hollow Knight: Silksong releases September 4. The original game feels like a lifetime ago. I’m grateful we’re getting Silksong at all. One of the biggest changes this time around is the main character. The Knight has been replaced by Hornet—a recurring presence throughout the OG Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>This guide is here to let you know if Hornet’s adventure is a prequel or if she’s the new face around the place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-to-the-original-game">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong a Sequel to The Original Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hornet has some sting. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry has declared Hollow Knight: Silksong to be a fully fledged sequel and is a brand-new story set after the events of Hollow Knight.</strong></p>



<p>You actually need to go as far back as Silksong’s reveal announcement for this answer. The original article appears to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190408202952/http://teamcherry.com.au/hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">archived</a>, but on 14 Feb. 2019, Team Cherry declared that Silksong was in development and that: “<strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight.</strong>“</p>



<p>So, we’ve known Silksong is a proper sequel since the beginning! Silksong started as DLC, but Team Cherry’s vision for the content quickly grew to the point that it made more sense to create a new game entirely. It explains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-knight-appear-in-hollow-knight-silksong">Will The Knight Appear in Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no official mention of The Knight appearing in Hollow Knight: Silksong—but this doesn’t mean it won’t.</strong></p>



<p><strong>*SPOILER ALERT: You have been warned.*</strong></p>



<p>2017’s Hollow Knight has multiple endings, and pretty much all of them end with The Knight sacrificing himself or becoming one with The Void. Team Cherry has said before that each ending is considered “canon,” so it’s fully open to interpretation what has truly happened to The Knight.</p>



<p>The Knight will easily go down as an all-time character for its design and heroism in 2017’s Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>You’d think a The Knight appearance would be kept a surprise. My guess is that we <em>will </em>see The Knight in Hollow Knight: Silksong in some Void capacity. It would also be fun if DLC or a special bonus skin could be unlocked that changes Hornet into The Knight!</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you hoping to see The Knight appear in any capacity? Does Silksong need to be careful with the story, given the importance of its predecessor? Let me know all your thoughts and more through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>IG has plenty of other Silksong guides and content: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-physical-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong have a physical release?</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-hollow-knight-silksong-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does Hollow Knight: Silksong have Early Access?</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it’s coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
