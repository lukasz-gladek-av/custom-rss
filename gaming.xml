This is the lowest price yet for best-selling book. It's not only topping the charts in various cookbook categories on Amazon, but it's just outside of the top 100 books across <em>every </em>category on Amazon. Target already sold out at this price, too, so we wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon sell out soon as well.</p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Not only is it an official piece of Stardew Valley merch, but Eric Barone--aka "ConcernedApe," the solo developer behind Stardew Valley--co-authored the cookbook along with Ryan Novak, who also wrote the Stardew Valley Guidebook and Hollow Knight Wanderer's Journal.</p><p dir="ltr">The book includes over 50 recipes inspired by meals in the game like the Pink Cake, Farmer's Lunch, Survival Burger, and Strange Bun. Much like the seasonal structure of Stardew Valley's gameplay, the book's recipes are organized by season, so you can try out new dishes that are perfect for Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. The recipes are accompanied by photography and illustrations.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Stardew Valley merch, check out this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stardew-Valley-Green-Junimo-Plush/dp/B01LYTIA5M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially licensed Junimo plush</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Activision has confirmed more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, and specifically a Hollywood actor who is playing a role in the game. Y'Lan Noel, who starred on the TV series Insecure and the movie The First Purge, is lending his voice to a new character in Black Ops 6.</p><p>Activision marketing boss Tyler Bahl confirmed this to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-voice-actor-ylan-noel-xbox-showcase-1236028659/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, saying Noel is playing an unspecified character seen in the game's key art. That's all the company would confirm about the character, but more details are expected to be divulged during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-reveal-event-when-its-happening-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/1100-6523968/" data-ref-id="1100-6523968">Black Ops 6 Direct</a> on Sunday, June 9.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEjmwoVrF0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kEjmwoVrF0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For now, Bahl said Black Ops 6 is a game about conspiracy theories and clandestine government agencies working in the dark. Players are asked to consider if what they have been told is in fact true. While Black Ops 6 is rumored to take place decades ago during the Gulf War, Bahl said its themes may be relevant still today.</p><p>"When we started to break this down, especially for today, in this moment, there's digital media being altered, there's things changing all the time," Bahl said. "I think one of the themes of the game is around, is the government working against you? Can I trust what I'm reading? Can I trust what I'm seeing?--just like the game is going to feel once players are able to play."</p><p>In addition to the new character played by Noel, Black Ops 6 is expected to bring back popular Black Ops characters like Adler and Woods. Black Ops 6 is rumored to launch in late October and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-could-be-a-concern-for-sony-analyst-says/1100-6524017/" data-ref-id="1100-6524017">will come to Game Pass on day one. </a></p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Black Ops 6 in the days ahead.</p>

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Expanse</em> is one of the modern juggernauts of the science fiction genre books. This is in part due to the excellent space storytelling and near-realism from authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck under the pen name James S.A. Corey. However, this popularity and success are also because of the equally highly recommended TV series. </p> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">If you’re missing <em>The</em> <em>Expanse</em> these days, here are 10 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">science fiction books</a> we’ve enjoyed that come the closest to capturing the grounded and darker tone of this beloved series. </p> <h2 id="h-hyperion-cantos" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/V6pwhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hyperion Cantos</a></em></h2> <figure data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">This sci-fi series from Dan Simmons encompasses four core books and a number of short stories. It is set up well enough that half the books feel like one series while the other half feels separate but connected. <em><a href="https://geni.us/V6pwhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hyperion Cantos</a></em> also has one of the most flexible and weird storytelling systems, with writing styles changing between novels. For instance, the first book has a <em>Canterbury Tales</em>-style split between main characters while the second book is told through a series of dreams. Some of these parts, especially the divided point-of-view storytelling, are reminiscent of <em>The Expanse’s</em> style.</p>
 <h2 id="h-lord-of-light" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/1FTwr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Lord of Light</a></em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">Roger Zelazny came out with <em><a href="https://geni.us/1FTwr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Lord of Light</a></em> in 1967 as a collection of seven different short stories following a crew of humans who mutated their bodies to gain supernatural powers to survive in their new world. The heavy imagery and symbolism make for a complex tale with several different characters and ideas to keep up with. In this vein, it feels quite a lot like <em>The Expanse</em> with all of the rotating characters and POVs you have to keep up with. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dune-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Aj8Ve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Dune</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true"><em>The Expanse</em> may feel a bit more grounded in its science fiction at times than the legendary Frank Herbert’s widespread <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/frank-herbert-dune-reading-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dune</em> series</a>, but there is no denying the monumental <a href="https://geni.us/Aj8Ve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Dune</em> novels</a> likely played some part in inspiring <em>The Expanse’s</em> creation. Everything from the wide set of characters to the intense focus on politics and society go together so well in both series. Not to mention, <em>Dune</em> has the unique benefit of both offering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a novel</a> and adaptation form, similar to <em>The Expanse</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-remembrance-of-earth-s-past-trilogy" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0CWyTeC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> Trilogy</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">Also known by the name of its first novel, <em><a href="https://geni.us/Nc5z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Three-Body Problem</a></em>, this series from Cixin Liu takes place throughout human history as Earth discovers and engages with the Trisolaran alien race. That premise alone gives off <em>The Expanse</em> vibes. However, it is also similar in the fact it has its own ongoing TV series adaptation, which is quite engaging. Those who like both versions of <em>The Expanse </em>might enjoy this trilogy’s book and streaming versions.</p>
 <h2 id="h-ender-s-game-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/pVI1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Ender’s Game</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">The first novel in this series, <em><a href="https://geni.us/R3ORI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Ender’s Game</a></em>, gives me the most <em>Expanse</em> vibes compared to sequels. Its smaller focus on a group of students at a military academy in space simultaneously allows for rich character development while also still containing massive twists for the universe as a whole. In this way, this sci-fi series reminds me of some of the earlier <em>Expanse</em> books. But all of the novels in this series from Orson Scott Card are worth a read.</p>
 <h2 id="h-chronicles-of-the-dread-empire-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ru9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Chronicles of the Dread Empire</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">This science fiction series comprised of eight novels begins with <em><a href="https://geni.us/ru9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Shadow of All Night Falling</a></em> from Glen Cook. This is a long series and an early one from the sci-fi author so it has a pretty slow pace and some awkwardness at times. However, if you get past all this, the world-building and character development is incredible, as it takes its time to truly invest the reader in its universe, much like <em>The Expanse</em> series.</p>
 <h2 id="h-revelation-space" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/1ArZL4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Revelation Space</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Science fiction doesn’t get more grounded than this <a href="https://geni.us/1ArZL4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">first novel by Alastair Reynolds</a>. With a background of a PhD in Astronomy and many years working at the European Space Agency, it masterfully bridges together three seemingly separate storylines. This is all familiar for those who like The Expanse and a highly recommended novel.</p>
 <h2 id="h-culture-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/TiobbpJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Culture</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Iain M. Banks came out with this series, beginning with <em><a href="https://geni.us/TiobbpJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Consider Phlebas</a></em>, in 1987. It focuses on the war between a utopian alien society and the other civilizations that surround it. The series spans thousands of years and each book pretty much acts as its own standalone tale within the overarching history. While it is far-reaching in its serialization, it stays just grounded enough to make everything believable in a similar vein to <em>The Expanse</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hainish-cycle-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/K2OqkWP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Hainish Cycle</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="true">This series of sci-fi novels from Ursula K. Le Guin, beginning with the first book <em><a href="https://geni.us/K2OqkWP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rocannon’s World</a></em>, takes place in a far future setting where humanity evolved in space, rather than just on Earth. This resulted in some rather wild and odd groups of people in the solar system, such as one colony that has dreams while awake. The exploration of the communication between the various societies in space leads to one of the most gripping means of storytelling in the medium.</p>
 <h2 id="h-altered-carbon-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/3xLV2Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Altered Carbon</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="false">While <a href="https://geni.us/3xLV2Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">this sci-fi series</a> is heavy on the cyberpunk aesthetic unlike most of the novels on this list, its heart and central mystery feel perfect for fans of <em>The Expanse</em>. The first book centers on a former soldier who investigates the murder of a wealthy man amidst a society with immortality essentially reached. There are even some surprising elements of space colonies and aliens that will be welcome for <em>The Expanse</em> fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-yoshida-interview-on-dawntrail-story-lore/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-yoshida-interview-on-dawntrail-story-lore<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="435" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The next big<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> update is almost here as early access approaches on June 28, kicking off a new era of the MMO after weaving a decade’s worth of storytelling. Even for the most enthusiastic of lore hounds, that’s quite a long time to remember so many little details, but during the expansion’s recent media tour rounds, director and producer Naoki Yoshida had a few suggestions on lore details to study.</p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Perhaps it goes without saying, but <strong>stop reading now</strong> if you would rather go into <em>Dawntrail</em> knowing as little as possible. The details below contain spoilers for<em> Endwalker</em> and little breadcrumbs leading into Version 7.0.</p> <figure data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">After spending a full day playing<em> Dawntrail</em>, I wrapped up by attending the <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Q&amp;A where Yoshida answered a few regarding the fifth expansion. Among those questions, Yoshida took a moment to answer Destructoid’s, carefully explaining what <em>FFXIV </em>details he’d recommend lore enthusiasts brush up on before playing. </p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">“I’m sure people have already played this,” Yoshida said. “But the most recent Alliance Raid, Myths of the Realm, would probably allow for some background information into more of the lore.”</p>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false">While Yoshida’s recommendation to complete <em>Endwalker’s</em> latest 24-man wasn’t much of a surprise, his follow-up was far more intriguing:</p> <blockquote data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"> <p>“Can people name all of the 14 seats of The Convocation? Perhaps that would be a good place to start in terms of digging into XIV lore. To prevent any spoilers, I think we’ll stop there!”</p> </blockquote> <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="897" data-injectable="true">For context, the director has made teases like these in the past, and they’re often vague, though helpful, tips for players trying to recall hundreds of hours of story content. Prior to<em> Endwalker’s </em>2021 launch, Yoshida told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/final-fantasy-14-director-recommends-these-raids-for-making-the-most-out-of-endwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> that he recommended completing the Bahamut, Alexander, and Omega raids before jumping in. After experiencing the expansion’s conclusion, I can’t imagine going through without knowing those details, but some raid stories are still segmented from the Main Scenario as optional content. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Players who strictly stick to the MSQ may want to dig into the quests and side stories involving the Myths of the Realm quest series and relevant mentions of the Convocation of Fourteen. Following along with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-every-alliance-raid-ffxiv/">Alliance Raid</a> is easy enough by following Journal assignments, but you may need to search a little harder for refreshers on the Convocation. They were the governing body over the Ancients’ pre-sundered world, possessing immeasurable power. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">The most straightforward mentions accessible in the MSQ are in ‘Etched in the Stars,’ a quest from the <em>Shadowbringers</em> ending, Patch 5.3. Then again in <em>Endwalker</em> upon reaching Elpis, you can speak to Emet-Selch during the quest ‘Their Greatest Contribution’ and ask to learn more about the Convocation. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="false">As for how it all links up, I’ve got a few ideas of my own, but I’m keeping my expectations tame. I’ve been wrong more often than not on where Final Fantasy XIV would take us next, and I would have never guessed how the last expansion cleverly tied in some of its earliest reveals. </p>

		<p>It’s that time of the year when marketing departments hold their heads and cry because Jimmy from the web team pressed a button a bit early. In this case our Jimmy looks after the 2K Games website and he put up a banner advertising the unannounced Civilization VII.</p>



<p>Our guess would be that the game will be revealed tonight as part of the Summer Games Fest.</p>
<p>It has been quite a while since the last Civ, as Civilization VI was released on PC way back in 2016. It was subsequently ported to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and even mobile devices. We gave the Switch version <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/03/civilization-vi-switch/">9/10 in our review.</a></p>
<p>“The Switch version is just the base game, but that’s more than OK,” said Nick. “There’s plenty to sink your teeth into, providing hours upon hours of unique experiences, accompanied by a divine soundtrack to really get you in the mood for building nations.”</p>

<p>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Games fest kicks off tonight, June 7th, and ahead of the show he took to Twitch for a Q &amp; A session, during which he tempered expectations for the show. “There will be, definitely, new announcements,” he said, “but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.”</p>
<p>“There definitely are things that are being announced but this is not a show that has a lot of like ‘coming in 2026’ or ‘2027’, or teasers for games that are years and years out… That’s generally what I would say in terms of expectation setting.”</p>
<p>Metaphor: Refantazio and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wild/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;are confirmed, along with indie games made “single devs”. Also in the show will be Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance and a trailer for some “cool DLC.”.&nbsp; Batman: Arkham VR from Camoflaj is also confirmed along with Dragon Ball Sparking ZERO and a trailer for the Among Us animated show.</p>

  <p id="aJ1goo">Finding the <strong>Dectus Medallion locations</strong> in  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23921448"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> takes a bit of effort — and more than a few risks — but the payoff is worth it if you want safe passage to Altus Plateau.#</p>
<p id="vihTB6">The <strong>Grand Lift of Dectus</strong> bypasses a mini-dungeon, dangerous cliffside paths, and a tricky boss fight and drops you at Altus Plateau’s southern end (mostly) free from harm.</p>
<p id="xk5APk">Finding the item that activate the lift is a bit of a riddle, but our <strong>Dectus Medallion</strong> <strong>locations </strong>guide breaks down where to look and how to get both pieces without much hassle.</p>

<p id="OXboDE">You can pick up the Medallion’s left half pretty early in Elden Ring, with the location found within <strong>Fort Haight, </strong>found in the east of Limgrave. <strong>The map calls it Fort Haight West</strong>, which is a little misleading. There’s no eastern variant of the mini-fortress, so the one in Limgrave is the only one you need to deal with.</p>
<p id="CPqsRG">The first challenge is actually reaching Fort Haight. Skeleton warriors wielding swords and shields bar your way, and a ballista perched atop the fort’s walls will periodically fire arrows at you. Use the wooden barricades for protection against the ballista, and carefully make your way around the fortress’ southern side. </p>

<p id="9JSXpG">Inside Fort Haight, you’ll find more enemies milling about — some wolves, a few skeletons with exploding pots, nothing too overwhelming until you reach the ramparts. If you’re struggling with enemies inside the fort or outside, I recommend leveling up (our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-limegrave-level-up-gatefront-ruins-stormgate-stormhill">rune farming locations</a> guide can help here) and trying again. Aim for level 10 or higher, if you can. Tempting as it may be to use your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ashes</a> to force your way through, you’re better off saving your summons for the battle against the fort’s mini-boss on the ramparts.</p>
<p id="YIQksq">That boss is a knight who uses the Bloody Slash ability, which flings an arc of blood at you and, if it hits you too often, inflicts the bleeding status. Bleeding is a quick way to end up at the nearby Site of Grace again, so focus on a defensive playstyle where you dodge, sweep in for a few attacks, and retreat to safety again. Magic users and those with ranged weapons will have an easier time, and having your Spirit Ash around gives the knight something to target who isn’t you.</p>
<p id="XRXpuA">You’ll get the Bloody Slash Ash of War — a useful ability that scales on Arcane and may inflict Bleed on your opponents — and complete <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23002158/nepheli-loux-potion-questline-location-quest-puppet-throne-room-kenneth-haight">Kenneth Haight’s quest</a> after defeating the knight and clearing out the fortress.</p>

The ground level is home to several bats, who stun you with soundwaves, and harpies, who fling poison at you and, even when you’re at high levels, can turn you into Tarnished dust with just two or three hits. A build that’s high Vigor, Endurance, and Strength could probably rush through and easily deal with the enemies inside, but if you’re piecing the Dectus Medallion together early in the game, you probably don’t have that build.</p>

<p id="JEeTSb">What you can do instead is let your Spirit Ashes take the brunt while you grab what you need. I recommend starting with no Runes or a negligible amount that you don’t mind not getting back. Step inside, use the jellyfish or lone wolves summons to distract the bats and harpies, and run to the back of the room. It’s almost literally a straight shot — take a slight left after rounding the first wall — so there’s little chance of getting lost.</p>

<p id="gAHfh2">Climb the ladder, and <strong>open the chest at the top to find the Dectus Medallion’s right half</strong>. The enemies down below won’t follow you up, in my experience. You can try escaping across the roof behind you, though two ghostly knights will manifest and do their best to strike you down, or you could try climbing down and running through the ground level again.</p>

<p id="GyA1t9">Once you have both medallion halves, <strong>head to the Grand Lift of Dectus at the northern end of Liurnia’s Bellum Highway </strong>— found at the north-east part of Liurnia of the Lakes, and not far from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994833/caria-manor-boss-location-level-map-dragon-sword">Caria Manor</a>.</p>
<p id="g4U4t8">Activate the Site of Grace there, if you haven’t already, and step on the circular platform between the four statues. <strong>The game prompts you to lift the medallion</strong>, and then a cutscene plays where the elevator rises and drops you off at the southern end of Altus Plateau — right behind two massive golem enemies. Ignore them, turn left, and activate the Point of Grace nearby.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-hawk-ops-aims-to-be-3-tactical-military-shooters-in-one<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There was a lot that came out of my hands-on time with Delta Force: Hawk Ops that I didn’t expect. I didn’t know it was a top-to-bottom reboot of the 1999 series of military shooters, re-imagined meticulously in Unreal Engine 5. I would have never guessed it was attempting to strike out at not one, not two, but three different current shooter sub-genres all at once. And I would have never imagined that my short time with it would leave me anxious to play more of its heavy tactics-focused running and gunning.</p><p>Developer Team Jade’s Head of Studio Leo Yao answered my most obvious question first: “How did a Chinese studio get their hands on such an American franchise?” Long story short, THQ Nordic acquired the assets from the original developer NovaLogic back in 2016, and it was lost in the Embracer Group slurry until it was rescued by Tencent a few years ago. “I’ve always had a soft spot for the series,” Yao told me, adding that outside of personal attachment, the team saw a lot of potential in reviving the franchise in 2024. They aren’t simply redoing the original game with shiny new coat of paint, either. They’re expanding it into a massive game with three distinct experiences: a large-scale, team-based PvP mode; an extraction shooter a la DMZ or The Cycle; and a single-player campaign with hopes of recapturing the magic of military shooters of yesteryear.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Delta Force: Hawk Ops - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A lot of that potential is in the series’ 2003 adaptation of the book Black Hawk Down, about the Battle of Mogadishu. Yao told me that as the most recognizable entry in the series, it served as the perfect point of re-entry, and the best place to start the re-imagining process. The first big change being that this version of the single-player campaign will be based on the Ridley Scott film of the same name, complete with the rights to footage. He wouldn’t give me details on how any of this would integrate into the campaign, or the fact that the rest of the game’s near future tech and aesthetics would potentially change the story based on an event from the early ‘90s. Nor did I get any hands on time with it specifically, but he did mention that it is the team’s goal to make it a challenging and intense FPS experience where bullets are extremely lethal and being caught out of position could spell disaster.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This version of Delta Force's single-player campaign will be based on the Ridley Scott film Black Hawk Down.</p></div><p>I spent most of my time with Havoc Warfare, Hawk Ops’ take on Battlefield’s Breakthrough, where attackers must take points of interest from defenders, pushing their zones of control further and further back until they’re completely run off the map. The first big difference between Hawk Ops and games like it is in the loadout screen. I had the option between four different characters, each with a suite of special abilities, weapons, and tools that made them unique from one another – much like the Specialists in the Call of Duty series, but with three or four unique actions per character. I warmed up with Kai, who is mostly your standard assault gunner who can speed himself up temporarily, but also has a handy rocket barrage that's great for clearing out tight spaces. I really got to sink my teeth into some more tactical options with Terry, who can use drones to scan for targets and immobilize them for a brief period, as well as set mines to trap enemies moving on objectives. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The map I played had some key fortified areas where using a little recon in advance of an assault really made the difference between taking an objective and getting stopped at the line. Unfortunately, I played in matches that were populated mostly by bots, and without pings or commands it was nearly impossible to coordinate these skills between players to make big gains, but the potential for comboing abilities for huge payoffs is written on the wall. Team Jade told me that other maps will test your squad’s tactical awareness even further as they’ll introduce mixes of indoor and outdoor objectives and verticality, as well as vehicles and weapon placements that can help teams get an edge or keep defenses solid.</p><p>Before you even choose your characters, though, you can fiddle with your loadout, or spend the in-game currency to buy some of the dozens of weapons and gear pieces available. Something remarkable about customizability in Hawk Ops is that not only do weapons have a ton of potential to add bits and bobs to them, all of which have some sort of consequence on gameplay, but each one of those pieces can be further customized, too. And not just colors, materials, or textures, but the actual size of pieces like barrels and cheek guards can be adjusted to make even more minute tweaks to weapons. I don’t think I have it in me to fine tune the lengths of all my favorite gun suppressors, but for those who are looking for an extra layer of optimization, Hawk Ops has what you need.</p><h3>Dukes of Hazard</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Item progression gets a little more complicated when you get to Hazard Operation, the extraction shooter portion of Hawk Ops. Weapons and mods can be bought from a greater marketplace (and can be meticulously modded as in other modes) but can be permanently lost if you’re downed while deployed. Yao smirked when I mentioned the prospect of a player losing a gun they spent an unreasonable amount of time preening over it in an abrupt hail of bullets. “The risk/reward elements of extraction shooters will be very present.” If you come across someone else’s precious weapon while in the field and don’t see the same value in it yourself, you can resell it on an open marketplace for in-game currency, a feature also present in games like Escape from Tarkov.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you deploy into Hazard Operations mode, your goal is to scoop up anything valuable and take it back to base to sell.</p></div><p>When you deploy into Hazard Operations, your goal is to scoop up anything valuable and take it back to base to sell. This could be other player’s prized weapons and armor, or rare treasures that only serve the singular purpose of being really valuable when resold, like a fancy futuristic VR console or some sort of super fancy high-tech medical equipment that I found on my journey. Clearly marked spots on the map highlight lockboxes that have a higher chance of containing something valuable, and are likely hotspots for enemy player activity. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Between these points of interest are various encampments, natural features like caves and cliffs, and old corporate buildings repurposed as fortifications for the many AI mobs that exist to put your life and your stuff in danger. These regular enemies will never be as significant a threat as other players, but they do at least keep the pressure on you to move with caution, as well as providing opportunities to earn basic equipment like ammo and health to keep you topped up on longer deployments. Not all of these NPC enemies are pushovers, though. Boss enemies with high health and rarer loadouts exist on the map to grant players added challenge in exchange for a higher chance of great loot. The one I found was draped head to toe with body armor and had several goons attacking my flank, but with a sound strategy heading up into its lair, I found a way to conquer it.</p><p>Though I could only try out one map, Yao and team assured me that multiple maps would be available to drop into at launch, each with their own layouts and points of interest. Something they really intrigued me was how character selection can affect your odds of survival. I was guided to choose the medical support character, as he had self-heals and a couple of reliable smoke deployment options to keep your movements hidden from dug-in threats. I can’t help but wonder how choosing someone like Luna with her Hawkeye-like trick arrows would fare in such an environment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops might share a lineage with the old PC series of the same name, but it doesn’t share much of a resemblance. Its single player mode is revamped from the ground up with modern tech, old-school difficulty, and the blockbuster Black Hawk Down film as both reference and inspiration. Its two multiplayer offerings – a large scale objective based crawl and a dynamic extraction shooter – help highlight how Hawk Ops’ level design and characters put team composition and tactical decision making ahead of twitch shooting. Will all of its ambitions come together in a game that has the chops to steal you from your current forever game? Time will tell.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

These are Visions of the Traveler, a bunch of little Travelers that are hidden around the Pale Heart and that you can pick up to trigger new dialogue from various characters.

And in his eyes, the two consoles have been key in helping games evolve technologically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talking to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview">GamesIndustry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he expressed surprise in how developers honed in on the PS5's capabilities. Before studios prioritized 60 frames per second, he'd figured games would stick with 30 frames since it offered more detail to a game's art style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Likewise, he didn't think raytracing would get much use, but it was a key tech feature for several PS5 launch games. Adding it was a "rather late" decision, and one he was unsure about given his work on "difficult" consoles like the PlayStation 3.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While that took him off guard, he was fine with being "totally wrong" about the tech. "I'm so happy to have seen the early adoption of the technology."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Consoles and &quot;hardware freedom&quot;">Consoles and "hardware freedom"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having worked on consoles for so long, Cerny believes their hardware freedom has given Sony a chance to lead by example, particularly for multiplatform games. Whatever goes into a PS5 can reflect current technology or what could get "100 percent adoption" in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To his point, he claimed PC ports of PlayStation games were "simpler [conversions] than many thought." Other than rising minimum specs (like more CPU or RAM), porting over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">hasn't been that difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, he stressed this wasn't some move to get in on the PC market a la Microsoft. Sony's just embracing not being "bound by any particular standards. I think that occasionally we’re even showing the way for the larger industry, and that our efforts end up benefiting PC players as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Consoles still have a place in Cerny's vision of games. So long as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo "continue making that very nice package, the future of consoles is pretty bright."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GamesIndustry's full interview with Cerny, which also covers his time at Atari and becoming a support developer, can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">Alongside these 30 milestone rewards, you can get leaderboard ranking prizes with additional dice, cash, and sticker prizes. However, gaining these rewards requires gaining more points than other players on the leaderboard, so you’re not guaranteed the top prize. Regardless, the rankings give you another opportunity to get extra items, so it’s worth watching the list to see where you land.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-in-the-monopoly-go-resource-run-tournament" data-injectable="false">How to score points in the&nbsp;Monopoly GO&nbsp;Resource Run tournament</h2> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">During <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Resource Run tournament, scoring points requires landing on railroad spots. Every railroad tile initiates one of two minigames, Landmark Shutdown or Bank Heist, that reward points based on the following outcomes:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"> <li>Shutdown – Blocked: Two points</li> <li>Shutdown – Success: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Small: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Large: Six points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Bankrupt: Eight points</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Although the minigame’s result is mostly random, the main gist of it is that you’ll gain more points if you take more money from the opposing player. A good rule of thumb for Landmark Shutdowns is to go for inactive players with no shields whenever possible. As for Bank Heists, this is almost entirely luck-based, so you’ll mainly have to hope you get a bankrupt result to maximize your points.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Outside of these minigames, your goal is to use mechanics like your dice multiplier to increase how many points you get from railroad tiles. After all, rolling 100 dice at once and bankrupting another player can give you 800 points, which will skyrocket you through the first few tournament reward tiers. Take advantage of resources like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/working-monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free dice links</a> and ongoing events to keep your dice supply high so you can get as many rewards as possible during this two-day tournament.</p>

<p data-characters="341" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Somehow, it’s been over 10 years since <em>Volgarr the Viking </em>delivered its brutal brand of hack-and-slash platforming. Now it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1798764585916436712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back for another round</a> of glorious battle in <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>, which is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG on August 6, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">You can see some of what developer Crazy Viking Studios has learned since releasing its debut game back in 2013 in the announcement trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Volgarr the Viking II Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Vch58Howw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">It’s wild to think about how many similarly challenging indie games have been thrust into players’ hands since the original <em>Volgarr </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-volgarr-the-viking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a>. The space is more crowded than ever before, and it’s also full of a ton of quality efforts within the same genre. As such, Crazy Viking Studios has evolved in some ways and is looking to offer players the means to hone their skills before putting them to the ultimate test on the battlefield.</p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">Among those modern upgrades are features like practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and even the option to run through with unlimited continues. These additions may not wholly sate <em>Volgarr</em>‘s bloodlust, though, so you’ll eventually want to try a run without them to see everything the sequel has to offer. As the description states, foregoing these “modern comforts” will allow you to unlock everything <em>Volgarr the Viking II </em>has to offer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195140/Volgarr_the_Viking_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Volgarr the Viking II</em></a> was initially unveiled as part of this week’s Guerrilla Collective showcase. It’s nice to see the release date land in that August sweet spot, giving us plenty of time to sharpen our steel again with the first game before diving into the second.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re still under the impression that an original MSI Claw might be a worthy purchase, I beg you to reconsider. MSI has now announced <em>not one but two </em>successors to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">the embarrassing handheld</a> that are coming this fall — and hinting it might show off <em>yet another one</em> at CES in January.</p><p>MSI already revealed an eight-inch Lunar Lake version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex">dubbed the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> at Computex this week, but the company will put Intel’s Lunar Lake into a new seven-inch version at the same time<em>. </em>MSI Claw product management director Clifford Chun revealed the existence of that handheld <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dj3AZcoA-vCY">in an interview with <em>PCWorld</em></a> and explained that should arrive with the launch of Intel’s more efficient Lunar Lake chips this fall.</p><p>Lunar Lake not only has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">up to 50 percent more GPU performance</a> than the current Meteor Lake — it requires substantially less power for the same performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23935783">One early demo showed it drawing 10 fewer watts</a>, which could translate to a notable increase in battery life. Plus, the Claw 8 can fit a far larger battery pack at 80 watt-hours vs. the 53-watt-hour pack of the original. </p><p>Every Claw 8 in the US will come with that 80-watt-hour pack, says Chun, though he says it’s optional elsewhere.</p><p>Both the new Claw 8 and Claw 7 will have revised bumpers, more responsive versions of their drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and an easier-to-replace SSD, says Chun — still the small M.2 2230 type, but they’ve been moved out from under the fan. Chun says they’ll ship with better Intel drivers this time around. Chun did not clarify whether the new seven-incher will have the larger 80Wh battery as well.</p><div><p>“We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4.”</p></div><p>Both will cost a similar amount to the current MSI Claw, says Chun, so expect them around $700–800.</p><p>MSI is completely committed to handheld gaming PCs, says Chun. “We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4. We have a long two-year roadmap down already. We’ll continue pushing new form factors, new ideas, maybe even new CPUs.” </p><p>But not necessarily AMD: “We’re not aiming to go to AMD yet, but you know, maybe in Claw 3, Claw 4?” He hints that future handhelds are likely to be a similar size or larger: it tried five-inch and 10-inch handhelds but found them too small and too heavy respectively, though a 6-inch is possible. “Six-inch, seven-inch — you can’t really tell the difference,” he told <em>PCWorld</em>. </p><p>Weirdly, Chun suggests the poor showing of the original Claw came as a surprise. “We thought the seven was perfect at launch,” he says, talking about how it was a surprisingly “steep learning curve.” But he says MSI is listening and wants to rapidly fix things.</p><p>“We really believe in handheld devices. Keep coming, keep letting us know, we listen, and we’ll improve.” That’s not much comfort to the original buyers who picked up a Claw mere months ago, but maybe it’ll mean good competition in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, at least as far as gaming is concerned, because Summer Game Fest is here. Also, the weather is much warmer and the actual summer solstice is just a few weeks away. So yeah, I’m callin’ it summer. </p><p>If you’re looking to get some gaming in this weekend, we’ve got a few recs to share with you, including a few new experiences that launched this week. Let’s get started with the long-awaited conclusion to a space opera story that all started more than 10 years ago.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f36b5df9e19c12c8635cb316637642b" data-recommend-id="image://2f36b5df9e19c12c8635cb316637642b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1894" data-height="1065" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cayde 6 holds up his gun while looking at someone off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cayde 6 holds up his gun while looking at someone off-camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f36b5df9e19c12c8635cb316637642b" data-recommend-id="image://2f36b5df9e19c12c8635cb316637642b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1894" data-height="1065" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cayde 6 holds up his gun while looking at someone off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: Nope)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get through the story and try not to get emotional about the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216">past ten years</a></span> of my life</p><p>It’s finally here.

They might even be done already. I’ll be away from home, but I’m thinking of bringing my console with me expressly so I can play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span><em> </em>and finish this fight. The road here has been difficult, both for fans of the series and its developers, so it’s a big moment for one of gaming’s biggest communities. I’m glad to be here and be a part of it.</p><p>I’ve been playing <em>Destiny </em>since the first game’s alpha test dropped us into the remnants of Old Russia and I fought my first Fallen Shank. I remember taking on <em>Destiny</em>’s first strike, the Devil’s Lair, and thinking it was the pinnacle of gaming. I came back for the beta, and was there on September 9, 2014 when <em>Destiny </em>launched. I still remember the week that Vault of Glass was introduced to the game. Me and my high school friends took on the challenge of our first raid and slammed our heads against the game’s byzantine leveling system as we squeezed our builds for any extra damage we could in order to overcome Atheon’s DPS check. We’d talk strategies in the back of our geometry class and run home to test them out. Some of those fireteam members are still some of my closest friends to this day, and that clunky, unpolished game remains a core memory of a defining era of my life.</p><p><em>Destiny</em>’s come a long way since then, and dammit, so have I. I’ve fought back the Fallen time and time again and eventually turned them into allies. I’ve gained the respect of a celebrated Cabal leader. I killed the fucking Taken King, his stupid-ass son Crota, and the rest of his godforsaken lineage. I lost the Light, got it back, and embraced the Darkness. I spent the later part of my teenage years and all of my adult life playing <em>Destiny. </em>This game has endured the most crushing defeats of my life, and it’s also been there to complement some of my greatest victories. For fuck’s sake, I cover this game for <em>Kotaku </em>now. This was <em>the </em>dream when I started playing it ten years ago. I’ve shared it with countless of my favorite people, and I can’t wait to share it with even more folks down the line. I don’t know what’s in store for either of our futures beyond this point, but I’m sure we’ll figure it out. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-recommend-id="image://2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-recommend-id="image://2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Be gay, get killstreaks</p><p>The problem with preferring to play multiplayer shooters is that it’s really hard to consistently play more than one of them at a time.

That’s me right now, plugging away at <em>A Realm Reborn </em>because I’ve just heard <em>so</em> <em>much</em> good stuff about what lies beyond, and at times, it does feel like a bit of a slog. </p><p>Still, even if the narrative isn’t sweeping me away, I can see it all serving as necessary set-up for things that might pay off in big ways in the expansions that await me. And I’m enjoying the lovely and varied world, maybe the game’s greatest asset. I hope the talented and hardworking artists and visual designers who created the architecture, the objects, and the environments that give each region such a rich and distinctive feel were paid very well for their work, because that, more than anything else, is what’s keeping me playing right now. I particularly love being in the forests of Gridania when dusk falls; the vibes, as they say, are immaculate. Also, I just ran a dungeon set in a haunted manor, which made for a wonderful change of pace from the more “dungeon-y” dungeons I’d done up to this point. So I don’t intend to be like the man in the meme and turn back any time soon, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t really eager to get to the better stuff (or so everyone says) that awaits. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-recommend-id="image://4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->343 Industries / Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-recommend-id="image://4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> <em>Halo</em>: Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV), <em>Destiny 2</em>: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck Nope)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Shoot things!

It’s the jump button more than anything else, it seems to sit just where none of my fingers want to find it, and I really feel like it should be an option to have it be a double-tap. But, whether because I’m constantly fed ego-boosting bots, or I’m preternaturally good at the game (I’m assuming it must be the latter), I keep on winning matches, unlocking stuff, and opening new modes (that all appear to be the same mode, but shhhhh), and that feedback loop has its claws in me.</p><p>I can see why some would not be impressed at an FPS without a fire button, but given the touchscreen controls, it makes a lot of sense to require just the “point” element of “point and shoot,” and heck, if it bothers you that much, there’s a toggle in the options. Personally, I am loving the loop, having a madcap fight which causes all manner of meters to fill up which unlocks so much stuff I absolutely don’t care about but am glad I unlocked anyway. Also, playing as a Wookiee is stupidly fun. — John Walker</p><hr><p>And that wraps our games list for the weekend. Happy gaming! </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I also sat down with game director, Naoki Yoshida, to chat about the team’s goals in representing other cultures.</p><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,191558,192610" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Though I remain wary of how <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>might handle the thornier aspects of depicting cultures close to my own Dominican heritage, much of what I was shown does at least indicate that <em>Dawntrail </em>will make for yet another exciting and deep expansion to everyone’s favorite critically acclaimed MMO.</p><h2 id="h306161"><a id=""></a><strong>Grab your floaties y’all, it’s summer vacation</strong></h2><p>It’s a running joke in <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> that just as things seem to be settling down and characters implore the Warrior of Light (your player character) to rest after saving the world <em>again</em>, another conflict arises that keeps them from getting their well-deserved break. The same seems to be true of <em>Dawntrail</em>, which pulls them to a whole new land to tK TK WHY,. But this latest important mission hasn’t stopped <em>FF14 </em>director Naoki Yoshida from telling players to envision <em>Dawntrail</em> as the Warrior of Light’s summer vacation. </p><p>Tural, the new land featured in <em>Dawntrail</em>, seems as appropriate a place as any to spend a summer break. It’s tropical and looks warm as hell, and many of the cultural touchstones that Tural takes inspiration from originated in Mesoamerican countries, like Mexico, where white people are known to vacation. The team has also promised a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-raids-field-operations-1851512773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-raids-field-operations-1851512773">fun new arcs</a></span>, including a tournament storyline that I’m sure folks will enjoy and more. Though the preview build that was made available to us was limited in how much of Tural (and its people) we could see and interact with, it looked and felt like a true slice of Central America, rather than a cheap caricature.</p><p>This was a specific concern of mine, as well as my joint interviewer and colleague <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OhMyMithrandir&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OhMyMithrandir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Sanchez</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/ffxiv-dawntrail-yoshi-p-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/ffxiv-dawntrail-yoshi-p-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>But Why Tho</em></a></span>. As Latinos, we’re used to our cultures getting bastardized by dishonest lenses or lazy writing, which often reduce us to tropes and mechanisms rather than see us as diverse and distinct people. Each of us are radically different versions of what a person might call a <em>latino</em>, and we always hope that we’re acknowledged and understood as part of a much larger and richer tapestry than our two individual (and different) backgrounds. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, and Yoshida himself, have faced tremendous backlash in the past over the perceived whitening of previously dark-skinned characters, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxvi-square-enix-naoki-yoshida-ff16-release-date-1849744847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxvi-square-enix-naoki-yoshida-ff16-release-date-1849744847">conspicuous lack of diverse characters</a></span> in both <em>14</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485"><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></a></span>, which Yoshida produced. It made his answers to our questions refreshing, and a little relieving, even if the game still has to prove itself.</p><h2 id="h306162"><a id=""></a><strong>Weaving a tapestry</strong></h2><p>During our interview, Sanchez asked Yoshida about<em> Dawntrail</em>’s specific inspirations, considering the lengths of the Latin Diaspora, which saw Latin American people spread across the world, forming their own cultures and dialects. <em>Dawntrail </em>and Tural feel shaped by two distinct forces: the team’s desire to explore someplace new and different from what it’s always known, and the feedback that it’s received over the curious absences of other perspectives and kinds of people in <em>FF14</em>. According to Yoshida, the team had already been doing exhaustive research into Latin American regions of the world, but as he also jokes, “I’m sure a lot of players have wanted to see tacos being featured in the game.” With cultural touchstones like food in mind, and a narrative that supposedly centers “understanding,” the team set about creating a world that tries to honor Latino culture and its multitudes.</p><figure id="" data-id="59c85a358c214cdfbecb3903c4276d56" data-recommend-id="image://59c85a358c214cdfbecb3903c4276d56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a town in Tural, Dawntrail's new land.

A temple can be seen above the village with a shining light coming from it, and the environment is warm, and filled with tropical trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I asked Yoshida about his and his team’s excitement for exploring a culture so outside of their respective purviews, he stepped back a bit and stressed that the team doesn’t view <em>FF14</em>’s expansion into Tural as some completion of an objective or quota. “I don’t think we want to specifically target this culture,” Yoshida answered via translator, suggesting that he and his team are not scooping up diverse cultures to satisfy some type of quota.<br></p><p>Instead, Yoshida, who’s often viewed by <em>FF14</em>’s fandom with reverence for his devotion to the <em>FF </em>universe, thinks of himself and his team as conductors of the kind of fantasy the players want to see. When he tells us that he wants to gauge fan reactions and continue to tell the kind of stories that they want, or when he mentions earlier in the interview that player feedback about implementing Latin American perspectives helped shape <em>Dawntrail</em>, I believe him. He’s molded <em>FF14 </em>to its audience time and time again, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, and <em>Dawntrail </em>doesn’t seem particularly different in this regard. Question the efficacy of his efforts all you want (I will continue to), but he clearly places <em>FF14</em>’s community first. Because of that we now have tacos, female Hrothgars (Latina queens), the land of Tural, and what I hope will be an honest portrayal of cultures like my own.</p><p>It may come across as a joke, but Yoshida and his team are quite proud of how they’ve treated aspects like food, which are huge touchstones for any culture. Various towns and villages around Tural, such as the hub of Tuliyollal, will have their own respective foods that differ from each other, so don’t expect to find the same dishes or exports in Urgopacha that you would elsewhere., .There will be melting pots, but the team is also taking the time to make sure Tural is broadly representative of many of the real differences in Latino cultures. And for the record, those are some Latino-ass names for those locales, so on first whiff at least, <em>Dawntrail</em>’s passing the smell test.</p><h2 id="h306163"><a id=""></a><strong>Time for a summer job</strong></h2><p>As is par for the course, <em>Dawntrail </em>not only adds a whole new section of the world to explore but entirely new jobs for players to adopt as they tackle Tural’s new challenges. These jobs are the melee-focused DPS Viper and the ranged-DPS Pictomancer, which are so visually and tonally distinct from one another that it’s hard picturing them as a part of the same expansion.</p><p>The Viper has a rogue, swashbuckling pirate vibe to them. If you’ve seen the promotional materials for <em>Dawntrail</em>, then you’ve seen the stand-in for the Warrior of Light in the Viper’s garb. The Viper’s gimmick is <em>complicated</em>, and so is making the most of the Viper’s extensive kit and skillset. Their weapon has two shapes, beginning in a one-handed form before one of your weapon skills transforms it into dual blades more fitting of an archetypal RPG rogue.</p><p>Whereas most jobs quickly settle into familiar skill rotations that can churn out the most damage, the Viper’s rotations are complex and branching. You can wail on the same command and get a satisfying combo going, but changing even one step of it for an alternative attack might generate an entirely different buff and subsequent effect. For most classes, this could be confused for a dropped rotation, but Viper feels infinitely more improvisational in the way that most of its individual skills still feed into its deeper capabilities. It will certainly require someone with a deep understanding of how to maximize DPS to wring everything from the Viper class.</p><figure id="" data-id="84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-recommend-id="image://84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-recommend-id="image://84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The entire time that you’re attacking as a Viper, you’re also building two gauges. One allows them to generate and store three charges of the aforementioned weaponskill that transforms the singular blade into dual swords, unlocking a whole new set of abilities that can generate even further combos. By the time that I got comfortable with the Viper, I was able to maintain lengthy combos without any dropped inputs that featured various weapon transformations. The job’s second gauge keeps track of something called Serpent’s Ire, which generates a certain amount of meter based on the rotations that you pull off. Getting to 50 (or half of the gauge) allows the Viper to go into a high-powered state that transforms most of their existing abilities into moves called generations and legacies. You’ll see skills labeled first through fourth generation, and you’ll want to do them in order, but every use of a generation move will also unlock a complimentary follow up legacy technique. In this situation, I fell back on a combo that executed the current generation and its accompanying legacy before moving onto the next until I had an eight-step combo which culminated in a pure burst of energy and a hefty chunk of damage to whoever was on the receiving end.<br></p><p>Viper is easily the most involved DPS I’ve ever played, especially considering the fact that I’m so used to jobs like Samurai where I’m able to just check out for the most part. It certainly runs the risk of alienating folks who were hoping for something flashy and immediately accessible, but I think if you’re looking for a deep job that requires an immense amount of thought and micromanaging, Viper will do the trick.</p><p>Pictomancer isn’t a straightforward gig either, but it’s at least a few difficulty notches below Viper’s branching combos. Pictomancer’s skills are all colors that are approximations of spells and elements seen in <em>FF14</em>, such as the color red and fire. The execution of a combo ending in blue will generate charges that can be used to deploy Holy, otherwise known as white here, and players can also use area-of-effect variants of the same colors to also generate the same charges while taking out multiple creatures.</p><p>Pictomancer can completely swap their palette though, allowing for entirely different elements which generate a darker charge used to deploy Comet instead of holy. While players can bounce between the palettes, Pictomancer’s most wild gimmick allows it to draw aspects of monsters and make them real, such as a damaging gale from a monster’s wings or the sting of its bite. First the player has to draw the aspect to unlock its skill, which adds the drawing to a series of canvases on screen. For example, the Pictomancer can draw a comically large hammer, which they then expressively swing like a cartoon character. Filling every canvas eventually allows the Pictomancer to deploy a high-damage attack that combines them all, but upon its use, the canvases are cleared to begin the cycle again. And this is only just scratching the surface of the Pictomancer’s intimidating range of abilities.</p><h2 id="h306164"><a id=""></a><strong>Business as usual</strong></h2><p>For all of its extravagances and new jobs to play with, the main content of the preview, a lone dungeon, was the most familiar part of the whole <em>Dawntrail </em>affair. Beginning in the midst of a chase along a river, the dungeon moved through much of the same motions of dungeons I’ve encountered before, and players shouldn’t expect much to be different here, though it was still an exciting mission by all accounts.</p><figure id="" data-id="6b72ac39eaaa7d04446baff9d3e8f4dd" data-recommend-id="image://6b72ac39eaaa7d04446baff9d3e8f4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the dungeon I was able to play, Ihuykatumu.

You begin the dungeon chasing another ship on the river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You are routed through a series of three boss fights, and each has their own set of mechanics that need mastery for you to survive. The first fight was pretty standard, attacking with large AoE techniques that needed to be dodged while simultaneously doing damage. The second fight featured a monster that would summon large vines from underground and risked flattening players.Without the usual ground markers telegraphing their attacks until the last minute, you had to actually size up the vines and the directions they were facing in order to avoid heavy damage or being reset if you were playing solo. The final fight featured my favorite mechanic of the entire dungeon, which was a moving tornado that also then shot out AoE techniques in a star like pattern around it, which called for precision to avoid.</p><p>I had a blast playing through it numerous times over, and its last fight was a particularly delightful, dizzying dance, making <em>Dawntrail</em>’s dungeons about up to snuff with the exemplary stuff you’ve come to expect from the game by now.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, I got to see some of 7.0’s other shiny new features, such as the overhaul of <em>FF14</em>’s graphics. Though I’ve never found the game to be anything short of pretty, MMOs aren’t often known for their visual fidelity, especially as far as character models and environments. But <em>FF14</em> has taken some mighty big steps with 7.0, which renders Tural’s countryside with stunning vivacity. Fields are much more lush as well and even just the detail on my beautiful female Hrothgar character (also new to <em>Dawntrail</em>) was several notches above the models currently in the game. Fidelity isn’t usually a point of emphasis for me, but I can’t deny that <em>FF14 </em>has successfully glowed up, and even more changes will continue to roll out over the course of the next few years.</p><p>All in all, <em>Dawntrail </em>is shaping up to be a promising expansion. Though Yoshida’s warned that it may not necessarily mark the start of <em>FF14</em>’s next sweeping saga, it is still a big step for the game and its team, which appears to be stepping out of its comfort zone with Tural. I will be watching it carefully, but if our conversations have illuminated anything, it’s that the team’s aware of what a big deal it’ll be to get this right. So much else about the expansion, including its intense new jobs and vibrant locale, that this team knows what it’s doing. Now all that’s left to do is see if <em>Dawntrail </em>successfully gives its players the best summer break ever when it arrives on July 2, 2024.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is based on the play of an in-development build of FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail, and content in the final version is subject to change.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-summer-game-fest-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from Esquire</a> – <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated by Kotaku</a> – has laid out the pricing structure of Summer Game Fest, and it ain’t cheap. Beginning at $250,000 for one minute of trailer time, Keigh-3 Keigh-sees some developers and publishers pay up to $550,000 for 2.5 minutes. Is it worth the steep price of entry? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This week, we begin by talking about Summer Game Fest’s significance in the wider landscape of video games and how, on one hand, it acts as a flashpoint that briefly gets multiple gaming subcultures on the same page, but on the other, it’s no E3. That in mind, should developers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to be part of it? Opinions are predictably divided. Then we talk about SGF-adjacent announcements like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em>’s puzzling name change</a> and <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/we-had-3-writers-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-here-are-9-things-one-of-us-found-but-the-others-didnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to a discussion of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg’s report on<em> Suicide Squad</em>’s fraught development</a>, which culminates in the birth of a new segment: These Guys Should Not Be In Charge. Speaking of, we then segue elegantly into a conversation about <a href="https://aftermath.site/variety-gaming-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety’s pivot (back) into games coverage</a>, which mirrors <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone’s recent games renaissance</a> – albeit with less Saudi money involved. Finally, we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve’s continued mishandling of <em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s bot crisis</a>, a story that resurfaces about once per year because, well, Valve still hasn’t solved the problem! And if that’s not enough for you, we close out by getting mad about trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy a Summer Game Fest slot and use it to advertise blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Kotaku reported that some smaller indies and also the big companies get in for free?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, so the big companies get in for free for a pretty obvious reason: They bring the eyeballs. What companies that are mid-tier and smaller are paying for is the ability to siphon off some of that attention and be part of something where people will remember their game alongside this major announcement from Big Company X. It will always be intertwined. People will always be like “What’s going on with that game that I remember, that stands out from the crowd, because it was part of this major showcase?” That part at least makes sense to me even if, from a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, I’m like, I don’t know about that, man. That’s a lot of money for a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> What it makes me wonder is, if the big companies don’t have to pay, who is paying $550,000. What company is that?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Probably the double-A companies, the Saber Interactives of the world.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Is that a good use of your money?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I saw some PR people talking online, and they seemed to think it was. On one hand, yeah, it’s a lot of money; on the other, this could be a singularly defining moment for the narrative surrounding your game. It could be the thing that puts it on the map and keeps it on the map for years to come. For some games that never end up in that place – that never get a chance to be on the map – yeah, [it’s an appealing proposition].&nbsp;</p><p>I think it’s a roll of the dice, though. There’s also a chance that based on the way the show is organized and everything like that, you could have your game get shown and then it gets stomped by a much more significant trailer. People immediately forget that your game was ever there. I saw people online talking about how longer segments tend to do better. Like, if you’ve got a little short trailer that gets sandwiched between two longer ones, it probably gets forgotten. But if you take up some actual screen real estate, people are not gonna forget, for better or for worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, you’re paying a lot in this era of booming development costs. It’s a lot of money. But I guess we don’t know what it costs to be in the Game Awards.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>We do. These are similar to the prices that Keighley charges for The Game Awards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Esquire also pointed out that Keighley is the only person officially on paper on The Game Awards LLC or whatever it’s called. But surely, obviously other people paid and involved in the show must cost a great deal of money too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and he hires production crews, rents out these massive theaters. I doubt that the show itself is cheap to produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, I don’t think he’s rolling around in a vault full of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I mean, I do think he’s rich, but I don’t think he’s pocketing most of this.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>People were talking about this in the comments to my blog – and the Esquire piece pointed this out, too – about how little we know about him as a person. He doesn’t even have a “personal life” Wikipedia section. And I’m tainted with this disease where I want to understand what everybody is like and think the best about them, and so I respect that for him. I respect that he has strong boundaries around his private and public lives, and he deserves that, and I admire that, and I want him to have that. But is he real? Does he live in LA? What is his life? What does he do? What is one fact about him as a guy?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Is he Canadian? These are very basic questions you can probably just ask somebody who knows him.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Who knows him?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But the idea of treating him like he’s a woodland creature or something like that [is funny].</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s sort of admirable that he’s both the product and not the product. His blankness lets these games shine even though he is the focal point. It’s a very elegant dance. I respect that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>His parents were involved with IMAX. We knew that because he got put on an award show much earlier in his life – when he was, like, a teenager – so he’s always been in this scene.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Typical IMAX baby.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Somebody in chat said he doesn’t actually do anything. He just waits until the next award show. I imagine him like an RPG character, selecting the “wait” option in the menu and setting it to 180 days from now. And then he just sits down like Geralt from <em>The Witcher</em>, kind of kneels, and that’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I don’t mean to be mean, but he does have a <em>Skyrim </em>NPC-like affect to his eyes. He does look like he’s going to say, “Fine greetings to you.” He’s got a flat affect. He’s so identified with his job that it’s hard for me to conceptualize him as a real person because I’ve never met him. It’s sort of like when you’re like “When I leave school, my teacher just lives under the desk.” You see them at the supermarket, and it’s fucking weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I’ve never seen his physical body [in person]. It’s like that time that I saw Jeff Bezos in The Washington Post office, and it was like, oh, he’s a real man with a body, and that body is in a space where my body is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw Geoff on the sidewalk at… I wanna say GDC one year. Some event where he would be, but kind of in incognito mode. But it was funny because he walked by, and this is when he was still following me on Twitter – he’s since unfollowed me – but I said, “Hey Geoff!” and he sort of grunted and kept walking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>And then he unfollowed you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Right then and there. It would’ve been great if he turned around, pulled out his phone, opened Twitter, went to my profile, and showed it to me as he unfollowed me. And then just walked away after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>That would be nice, yeah.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I would dine out on that story for years.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> And he would deserve it. Good for him. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The bundle includes 27 items from the Black Library, and there are some real gems here, as well as the start to several series. These books are in ePUB and MOBI format, which means that they can be read digitally on an ereader or browser.</p>
<p id="RnmYQw">The highlights include some anthologies from the Horus Heresy, a sprawling prequel series that takes place 10,000 years before the main 40K setting. <em>Lupercal’s War</em>, <em>Cthonia’s Reckoning</em>, and <em>Sons of the Emperor</em> all include tales from the Heresy.</p>
<p id="fuwXhC">If you prefer more modern stories, there’s some absolute bangers that take place in the dark millennium. <em>Fire Caste</em> by Peter Fehervari is one of my favorite 40K books; it’s <em>Apocalypse Now</em> through a grimdark, far future lens. <em>The Lords of Silence </em>by Chris Wraight<em> </em>follows the corrupted Death Guard, Chaos Space Marines in service to the Plague God Nurgle. You might think that’s an unrelatable point of view, but Wraight does a fantastic job at getting the reader invested in these characters. <em>Valedor</em> by Guy Haley is also considered to be one of the best novels about the Aeldari.</p>
<p id="2CRYQ1">In addition to these books I’d heartily recommend, there’s a wealth of literature I haven’t had the chance to pore through yet, like <em>Dark Apostle</em>, <em>Space Wolf</em>, <em>Lucius: The Faultless Blade</em>, <em>The Talon of Horus</em>, <em>Ice Guard</em>, <em>Avenging Son</em>, and <em>Titanicus</em>.</p>
<p id="kuUWCu">There’s also a selection of books from the <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, the wildly inventive and imaginative setting that was born out of the original Warhammer Fantasy Battles. I, for one, am looking forward to learning about history’s biggest hater in <em>Nagash: The Undying King</em>, by Josh Reynolds.</p>
<p id="h1VdRb">If you’re a fan of Warhammer, but aren’t sure where to start when it comes to the massive Black Library, this bundle is a great — and relatively inexpensive — option. The Bundle will end on June 27.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24100988/best-blu-rays-2024-4k-uhd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="Xl3fo9">Welcome to the one place your movies are safe: the land of physical media. </p>
<p id="dtyKpT">Perhaps you’ve lost faith in streaming companies to make your favorite movies easily available. Maybe you saw Max delete <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23297385/hbo-max-originals-best-list-where-to-watch-streaming">original films</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23313193/hbo-max-infinity-train-summer-camp-island-ok-ko-watch">shows</a> from its platform. Perhaps you’re tired of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21266801/best-movies-on-netflix">Netflix</a> cycling movies on and off the service. You could just be tired of having to Google where to find a particular movie, only to learn that what you found is already out of date. </p>
<p id="fcYW38">We make an effort to celebrate not just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch">what’s new on streaming</a>, but what you can still own on Blu-ray or 4K UHD. Discs have better sound and image quality, but their real selling point is their permanence.</p>
<p id="6aVGLy">I had my own breaking point with streaming that launched my return trip to the shores of physical media. A couple of years ago, I began to notice many movies weren’t available to stream, neither on a subscription service nor VOD. In fact, some I could hardly even find on physical media, because the film got caught in a licensing dispute or its owners simply didn’t feel they’d make enough money off a restored release.</p>
<p id="lMaBe4">That’s why I’m so happy to share these recommendations, most of which come from medium and small labels, from big names like Criterion and Arrow to up-and-comers like Radiance and Severin. As retailers like <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/best-buy-ending-dvd-blu-ray-disc-sales-1235754919/">Best Buy scrap their Blu-ray aisles</a> and studios like Disney hand off distribution duties, these dedicated labels are keeping hundreds of films from falling off the face of the Earth.</p>
<p id="99ZJrd">What follows is our rolling list of the best Blu-ray and 4K UHD discs of 2024. We update the list regularly, so be sure to check back for the latest recommendations!</p>

<p id="P7PCJx">If you love Studio Ghibli films and yearn to take one step deeper into the ocean of anime, try the catalog of Makoto Shinkai. Though the director’s films haven’t hit cultural inescapability in the U.S. like <em>My Neighbor Totoro </em>and <em>Spirited Away</em>, they’re hardly niche. Films like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15209584/your-name-love"><em>Your Name</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/19/21072640/weathering-with-you-review-makoto-shinkai-anime-gkids"><em>Weathering with You</em></a> have been phenomena among folks who pay close attention when they see the words “<a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/genre/anime/">Fathom Events</a>” or “<a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/distribution/crunchyroll-sony-and-wild-bunch-team-to-distribute-makoto-shinkais-suzume-no-tojimari-worldwide-216582.html">Crunchyroll Presents</a>.”</p>
<p id="I5cU8x">The director’s latest film, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23681072/makoto-shinkai-suzume-your-name-anime-romance"><em>Suzume</em></a>, tells the classic fairy tale of (checks notes) a man who turns into a chair and must partner with a teenage girl to save Japan from a gargantuan worm that embodies the anxiety of ecological collapse. Sorry, did I say classic? I meant batshit unpredictable. How did this get made? What good deeds did I do to deserve a gift of such joyous creativity?</p>
<p id="cNuCKP">Last year, the film took the 14th spot in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23597815/best-movies-2023">Polygon’s list</a> of the year’s best movies. This year, it’s one of our favorite Blu-rays. The special edition disc includes an abundance of extra features (including a beautiful art book) that will not only help viewers better appreciate the movie but also appreciate the broader work of Makoto Shinkai. The director provides a commentary, performs a stand-alone interview, and participates in a creative roundtable. Plus, the disc includes a behind-the-scenes documentary.</p>

<p id="z05Pca">Few films will flaunt (or shame) your home theater setup like <em>Crimson Peak</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s modern gothic horror romance. Set in the shadowy corridors of a decrepit English estate — lit by the moon, flickering candles, and supernatural glow — the film pleads for the pitch-black pixels and HDR brightness of an OLED TV.</p>
<p id="My1gDy">Can you enjoy this movie without a killer setup? If you like del Toro’s other movies, yes, you will probably love<em> Crimson Peak</em> even if you watch it on your smartphone. But there’s no getting around del Toro’s scope; he’s a director in the classical style, filling his scenes with handmade sets, detailed costumes, and general pizazz meant to be seen on the biggest and best screen available.</p>
<p id="v9atYF">The folks at Arrow have designed clever packaging to connect the film with its inspirations, presenting the case as a dusty old novel plucked from the shelves of a rare bookshop. The image lives up to the film’s visual ambitions. And for longtime fans, the package includes hours of supplemental material, including a commentary with del Toro, a 50-minute making-of video, a lengthy video essay, a deep dive into Gothic romance, and plenty more. </p>

<p id="Y4pcYQ">Announced roughly two years ago for home video release, <em>A Place Further Than the Universe</em> finally arrives on physical media in a spectacular special edition that more than makes up for the delays. For newcomers, the series (one of the best anime of the last decade) chronicles the Antarctica expedition of four high school girls. Its unique recipe mixes missing-person mystery, chill hangout comedy, and coming-of-age drama to immaculate effect. And as a 13-episode stand-alone series, you can enjoy the entire thing over a single weekend.</p>
<p id="ObvTzy">But we have to talk about what literally comes in the set: a poster (cool!), four art cards (nice!), and a 92-page journal (!!!) filled with character breakdowns, concept art, creator interviews, and more — all presented like a DIY scrapbook. I’m not much of a collector of pack-in knickknacks, but I adore this little book. </p>
<p id="zQtWrH">Not enough? The set also includes a making-of featurette and two soundtrack CDs. Shout Factory is handling the U.S. release, but if you’re in the U.K., Anime Limited is your source</p>

<p id="j2W5kv"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23473565/andor-season-1-review"><em>Andor</em></a><em> </em>rules. Hell, I’ll go so far as to say this new(ish) TV series gives the original Star Wars films <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23352914/best-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-ranked">a run for their Imperial credits</a>. But unlike the movies, which have played on the biggest theatrical screens and received multiple home releases, <em>Andor </em>has spent its first years marooned in the Disney Plus solar system. This beautiful 4K set transports the series to the home theater, now with no internet (or streaming visual artifacts) required.</p>
<p id="N5rnP9">The SteelBook release also includes some tangible concept art cards and intangible bonuses, ranging from talent interviews to VFX breakdowns. However, they’re the definition of supplemental material. There’s one reason to grab this disc: to watch fresh, great Star Wars in the best format possible.</p>

<p id="Wcht1R"><em>Picnic at Hanging Rock</em> is like a ghost story about people who aren’t dead yet. Based on the 1967 novel of the same name, Peter Weir’s film (made only a few years after the book was published) begins like a traditional period piece, chronicling a field on Valentine’s Day of 1900. A group of schoolgirls, accompanied by their teachers, host a leisurely picnic at (where else) Victoria’s natural landmark, Hanging Rock.</p>
<p id="DbwGp1">But long before children go missing and a search begins, something is… off. About the kids. About the setting. About the actual texture of the film. Have you ever fallen asleep on the grass during a long summer day? You awake with blurry eyes, a festering sweat, and a heat exhaustion that makes everything feel as if it’s stuck in freshly poured tar on playground pavement. That’s how Weir captures the incident at Hanging Rock so that the viewer won’t notice when exhaustion turns into hallucination and then into something altogether phantasmagorical.</p>
<p id="UhhpLp">The first viewing makes for a killer mystery that blends horror elements with the Australian New Wave. But what’s special about the film, on repeated watches, is the comedown. Eventually, the other students and teachers must return to the school and society. And they must try to snap this psychedelic puzzle piece into the puzzle of their lives.</p>
<p id="Zgx50K">The Criterion release, now available in 4K, makes the most of HDR, the film looking as if it too is baking under a heat lamp. The disc includes an interview with Weir, a behind-the-scenes on-set documentary, and most interestingly for longtime fans, Weir’s early 52-minute short film,<em> Homesdale.</em></p>

<p id="1V32w1">I saw Satoshi Kon’s first film long before I was ready. I was one of those ’90s kids who rented <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/30/20836173/perfect-blue-satoshi-kon-explained"><em>Perfect Blue</em></a> as a dare and couldn’t emotionally process the traumatic moments that would later inspire some of the most eye-scrubbing scenes in Darren Aronofsky’s <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>. I was 14 or so. I barely had the stomach to handle the opening of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>. </p>
<p id="q06vfW">Since then, Kon’s work has become, for me, so much more than a provocative box at Blockbuster. The director followed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2022/10/18/23409442/scary-horror-movies-to-watch-psychological-thrillers-perfect-blue-wrong-turn-bad-milo"><em>Perfect Blue</em></a> with three films — <em>Millennium Actress</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/19/21029789/satoshi-kon-tokyo-godfathers-anime-gkids-re-release-4k-restoration"><em>Tokyo Godfathers</em></a>, and <em>Paprika</em>, along with one TV series, <em>Paranoia Agent</em> — before dying of pancreatic cancer in 2010 at the age of 46. </p>
<p id="qcgxTU">By college, I had the chance to catch up on the catalog and see <em>Paprika</em> when it arrived in U.S. theaters. And I knew, within minutes, I’d found one of my favorite artists. I cherish that journey, from being a kid who doesn’t know what he’s seeing and being terrified, to being an adult who <em>still </em>doesn’t always know what he’s seeing and finding that affecting.</p>
<p id="QRkKRP">Kon has become more popular in recent years with semi-regular showings of his films at rep houses and popular theater chains. Last month, the popular movie podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blank-check-with-griffin-david/id981330533"><em>Blank Check</em></a> completed an exhaustive and lovely reassessment, working from <em>Perfect Blue</em> to <em>Paprika</em>. My advice for newcomers? Go in reverse order. <em>Paprika</em> has inspired — to say the least — Christopher Nolan, particularly his mind-bending thriller <em>Inception</em>. From there, you can enjoy the criminally underappreciated Christmas film <em>Tokyo Godfathers</em>, then learn the history of Japanese cinema through<em> Millennium Actress</em>, and then, when you’re ready for it, <em>Perfect Blue </em>will be waiting.</p>
<p id="BLwuCO">This disc, presented in a stunning 4K transfer, includes interviews with many of Kon’s collaborators.</p>

<p id="3aCaMX">Arnold always had it. </p>
<p id="H03daA">In 1982’s <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> (released two years before the first Terminator film), the champion bodybuilder turned actor looks like he left the Gold’s Gym weight room and strolled onto set, yet he delivers a fearless performance that should be the envy of Juilliard grads. Don’t believe me? Focus on what Schwarzenegger does with his face. Though every other part of his body has been cut from a single slab of marble, his mouth and eyes twist and widen in ways that call to mind great silent film performances.</p>
<p id="9b2hNh">This new 4K release from Arrow is a shrine to these early days of Arnold, which would pour the foundation for the following decades of his R-rated popcorn masterpieces. The set includes an archival commentary with the man himself, along with a new commentary by Paul M. Sammon, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conan-Phenomenon-Paul-Sammon/dp/1616551887?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Conan-Phenomenon-Paul-Sammon/dp/1616551887?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23865029__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23865029__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Conan: The Phenomenon</em></a>. A second disc includes a king’s bounty of documentaries, interviews, and on-set footage that provides juicy info on every aspect of the film, from its look to the killer score.  </p>
<p id="fYJVBU"><em>Conan the Barbarian</em> hasn’t had the lasting power of other Schwarzenegger classics, but that comes with its silver lining: The odds are high you haven’t seen this delightful epic full of elaborate sets and practical effects.</p>

<p id="edQwgD">Saul Bass is known as one of the great creators of <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/lists/celebrating-saul-basss-centenary-10-essential-title-sequences">opening credits</a>: <em>Psycho</em>, <em>Vertigo</em>, <em>The Man with the Golden Arm</em>, <em>Seconds</em>. Even if you haven’t seen those films, you’ve seen the work of Bass’ admirers. His work is still being parodied and pastiched by the likes of Steven Spielberg and Matthew Weiner, who borrowed liberally from Bass with the iconic opening credits of <em>Mad Men</em>.</p>
<p id="a8ERSb">Bass, however, is not known as a film director. He directed one feature film and it bombed so hard it got the <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> treatment. What a shame. <em>Phase IV</em> is an ambitious and fearless sci-fi film that deserves reappraisal. This 4K restoration may be its best shot.</p>
<p id="dBowai">You’ll understand why this film benefits from a proper visual upgrade from the blurry depths of the home video bin. Bass spends an exceptional amount of the film’s run time with actual ants, shooting them with microlenses so that they look (and even behave) like characters. He doesn’t give them cheeky voice-over; he just lets our minds wonder what might be going through their heads. </p>
<p id="eCDLQA">Like I assume an actual global ant takeover would work, the movie stars very slow and small, the camera leisurely following a couple of ants through their daily activities. But in time, their efforts gain momentum, and suddenly ants are bringing down buildings and converting poisonous sludge into antlike weaponry.</p>
<p id="aPq43o">Bass took this project seriously, and Vinegar Syndrome has mirrored that approach with the three-disc set, including a Blu-ray disc featuring a reconstruction of an early version of the film, plus the original ending that really must be seen to be believed. We’re talking ending of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> stuff. With ants!</p>

<p id="btO8TY">If you like horror, you’re familiar with <em>The Ring</em>, either in its original form from Hideo Nakata or its American adaptation by Gore Verbinski. It’s less likely you have seen its follow-up, <em>Dark Water</em>, in which Nakata once again adapts the work of author Koji Suzuki to terrifying effect.</p>
<p id="YCvXj8"><em>The Ring</em>’s central premise of a deadly videotape and ticking clock toward death is unforgettable. But for me, <em>Dark Water</em> is a stronger drama, one that spends equal time on scares as it does spelunking the interior lives of its single mother and child. As to be expected from an Arrow release, the package includes a grab bag of interviews, trailers, and even a short documentary on the making of the film.</p>

<p id="u6kHJj">Despite being a big-budget, Oscar-nominated sci-fi spectacle made by James Cameron, <em>The Abyss</em> has been unavailable (in high-quality formats) for decades. If you lived in New York or LA, you could pray for a repertory screening; otherwise, your best bet was making do with a 20-year-old DVD. </p>
<p id="93GMm7">Alongside 4K releases of <em>Aliens</em> and <em>True Lies</em>, James Cameron’s original sci-fi masterpiece finally gets the home video treatment. The final product is incredible — as if everyone involved in this release wondered, in the back of their heads, if it would be another 20 years before <em>The Abyss</em> gets some TLC.</p>
<p id="QsZf1U">The picture and the sound make the most of the 4K HDR disc, whether it’s a glowing alien spacecraft or the close-up of an exceedingly handsome Ed Harris shouting technical jargon about watercraft. Sure, the computer-animated special effects have aged since 1989, but they still fit comfortably within the film. Credit the art direction, along with what I have to imagine was a great deal of technical attention in the film’s long restoration process. </p>
<p id="k9mtoj">The set includes nearly two hours of additional documentaries and interviews. It’s nice gravy. But frankly, we’ve been waiting so long for the mashed potatoes that I would have been fine with them scooped right on my plate, simple and delicious.</p>

<p id="cZHjKQ">Released in 1939, only six years after the end of Prohibition, <em>The Roaring Twenties</em> was made by people who could remember that era — who <em>lived</em> it. For director Raoul Walsh, the Roaring ’20s were the years he cut his teeth as a director in Hollywood, putting out 14 films in 10 years. Considering the state of Los Angeles at that time, it’s safe to assume he was familiar with the world of bootleg liquor.</p>
<p id="SQgvBp">Perhaps that’s why Walsh imbues his criminals with such humanity, rather than treating them like the petty parodies with which so many other gangster movies indulge. That the cast is a murderers’ row of Golden Age talent, including James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Priscilla Lane, certainly helps give each character a spark of life, too. </p>
<p id="bl1HUT">Why, though, is this movie on this list versus countless other old movies? Because it moves like a modern film. Spanning a decade in under two hours, the movie hurls forward like a Model T with nitrous boosters. </p>
<p id="qM0MQH">For some film history context, the disc includes a commentary with historian Lincoln Hurts and an interview with critic Gary Giddins, along with a handful of additional bonus features to sweeten the pot.</p>

<p id="f2fnNv">Radiance has become the Criterion Collection for movies I’ve never heard of. When a new disc arrives, it will most likely be a surprising delight, and at minimum, something that gets me thinking about what movies can and should be. This year, I can already recommend <em>Goodbye &amp; Amen</em> (an Italian spy thriller), <em>Allonsanfan</em> (a stately drama with a not-to-be-missed Ennio Morricone score), and as you’ve seen above, <em>Black Tight Killers</em>.</p>
<p id="cZnfc0">Forget story. With <em>Black Tight Killers</em>, you only need to know the ingredients. A gang of female assassins who wield deadly vinyl records. A bundle of lost World War II gold. A 1960s pop score that would make Austin Powers grin. You can feel director Yasuharu Hasebe having a blast with this film; the joy is contagious.</p>
<p id="IdGrtR">Radiance includes an archival interview with the director and a commentary track featuring critic Jasper Sharp, and while I’m grateful for the inclusions, the star of the show is the film itself: a quirky delight that speaks for itself with cool suits, audacious colors, and action sequences involving everything from a helicopter to an improvised flamethrower.</p>

<p id="7rVHN2">But reader, if you want a set so pretty that you can display it in your living room, there’s only one choice: the new limited-edition coffee table book collection. It technically is a book, the discs resting in sleeves between pages full of classic photos, posters, and original art. But the cover looks more like a poster, ready to be framed.</p>
<p id="qcraGm">The set includes tons of special features for every film, from <em>Frankenstein</em> to <em>Creature from the Black Lagoon</em>. One caveat: This set is limited to 4K. If you’re a hardcore collector, this set rules and you’ve probably already made the purchase. If you’re new to these exceptional horror standards, the other box sets are just as worthy as entry points.</p>

  <p id="tuO5o3">Two things can be true at the same time.</p>
<p id="AkwhLG">One: We’re halfway through 2024 and the AAA video game industry hasn’t had a single new, mainstream breakout hit. More damning: If we look at the months ahead, the biggest-budget release of this year may be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date">an expansion to the biggest game of 2022</a>. For folks who’ve spent decades filling their weekends with blockbuster games from name-brand publishers like EA and Activision, 2024 may feel like a wash. </p>
<p id="6vwWiQ">I suppose I could spend the next thousand words explaining the shortsighted failings of video game executives who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis">steered well-intentioned productions into fickle trends</a> that would fade long before a game’s release. But today, I want to do something a bit different. Rather than bemoan poor business decisions, I’d like to celebrate the abundance of creative decisions outside AAA. Which brings us to…</p>

<p id="hYC5cm">Two: We’re living in an unprecedented moment of video game abundance. You just need to know where to look. (And you should probably consider <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23941731/best-pc-games-windows-mac-steam-epic">a desktop PC</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22948034/steam-deck-best-games">a Steam Deck</a>.) </p>
<p id="dyMvkD">In May alone, we saw the release of 12 games that were at minimum good, mostly great, and in a couple of cases, earned spots on Polygon team members’ unwritten greatest-games-of-all-time lists. This weekend, as you take in the AAA pageantry of Summer Game Fest, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">watching countless trailers</a> for games that won’t be available <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">for months or even years</a>, I urge you to try one of these delights. All of which, I remind you, are available <em>right now</em>!</p>
<p id="rUQQIl">To help you select the right fit, I’ve written a little elevator pitch for each option.</p>
<hr id="MQAcdg">
<h2 id="v4CKPa"><strong>12 incredible new games to play right now</strong></h2>
<div id="Q8fk5b"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFI1QSd4T2g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="lLzlCH"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/"><em><strong>Selaco</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> A micro-indie studio built a new, narrative-rich sci-fi universe that blends <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>System Shock</em> without skimping on tight, brutal gunplay. And they constructed this magnificent Frankenstein’s monster on the ultra-upgraded skeleton of the tools that powered <em>Doom</em>.</p>
<p id="IbaLdo"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2238040/Tiny_Terrys_Turbo_Trip/"><em><strong>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong>What if Double Fine (the creators of the Psychonauts and Monkey Island series) made a spiritual sequel to the PS2-era cult classic <em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>?</p>
<p id="UmbIUI"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/"><em><strong>1000xResist</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> Many critics have compared this narrative adventure to<em> 13 Sentinels </em>and <em>Nier: Automata</em>. I adore those games, but <em>1000xResist</em> has more in common with sci-fi literature, particularly the works of Ted Chiang. Where <em>13 Sentinels</em> explored the tropes and history of the sci-fi genre and<em> Nier: Automata</em> dug into the wavy line between gods, humans, and machines, <em>1000xResist </em>asks something more individual: what society would make of a teenage girl with immunity to a fatal pandemic — not just in the short term but the very, very, very long term. Unlike with <em>The Last of Us</em>, the answer doesn’t involve killing every character you meet. </p>
<div id="WMbi3K"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISmiWUpiDs4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9ygZmb"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2882440/DEVIL_BLADE_REBOOT/"><em><strong>Devil Blade Reboot</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> If you have enough imagination to buy into the thrills of an old-school pixelated shoot-’em-up (not everybody does!) then congratulations: You’ve just discovered the most high-octane action video game of 2024. Name any other game that lets you pilot a “not an X-Wing” and obliterate a “not a Star Destroyer” one colossal chunk of spacecraft at a time.</p>
<p id="kAXzUr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/"><em><strong>The Rogue Prince of Persia</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> For years, the team at Evil Empire expanded upon <em>Dead Cells </em>with its many decadent updates. With <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, they had the opportunity to build their own thing from the ground up — incorporating lessons learned from their time on the iconic indie. (Weirdly, this isn’t the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033589/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft-switch">only exciting Prince of Persia game</a> released this year. Words I never thought would be written without fear of humiliation.)</p>
<p id="tU7AhQ"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/"><em><strong>Arctic Eggs</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> A first-person shooter but instead of a gun you have a frying pan, and instead of shooting people in the face, you make them eggs. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158540/arctic-eggs-egg-frying-game-steam-release"><em>Arctic Eggs</em></a> looks like a PS1 horror and plays like a WarioWare minigame.</p>
<div id="z4ZLOJ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZfzqnvBntA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zrTQD0"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/"><em><strong>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong>I am neither smart enough nor patient enough to appreciate this game. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24156442/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-steam-pc-nintendo-switch">people smarter and more patient than me</a> adore the puzzle adventure that requires its players to take copious notes in a physical notebook.</p>
<p id="53qVZy"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996010/Crow_Country/"><em><strong>Crow Country</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong><em>Crow Country</em> has been compared to the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, a horror throwback to the days of low-polygon models and cheeky environmental puzzles. It is that, to be clear. It’s also a loving, playable homage to the video game magazines of the ’90s. The aesthetic is both grimy and blurry, resembling the video game screenshots of that era — a very specific look. Back then, a moment on a TV screen would be captured by a photo, then digitized into a print layout, and lastly printed, each step degrading the original image’s quality in a unique (and now nostalgic) way. The game’s creators also stuffed the world with tips-and-tricks pages, like the guides that used to be found in the back of long-dead mags like GamePro and Nintendo Power.</p>
<p id="GXfFiC"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/"><em><strong>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> Do you miss the days of Tamagotchi? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161871/yolk-heroes-a-long-tamago-pet-sim-idle-game"><em>Yolk Heroes</em></a> reimagines the “virtual pet” genre through the lens of idle games — those compulsion-nurturing time sucks mostly played on smartphones. Unlike its more nefarious contemporaries, <em>Yolk Heroes</em> includes a plethora of options to modify the game so it will take as much or little time as you feel comfortable with. </p>
<div id="5VLaQj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSw8UGZQezs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="HVRykN"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1373960/INDIKA/"><em><strong>Indika</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> A nun who may or may not have the devil in her head goes on a road trip with a mysterious man who may or may not have been divinely blessed in alternate-history 18th-century Russia. Is that not enough? The game is part of a growing movement to change <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167443/indika-video-game-movies-cinematic">what makes a game cinematic</a>.</p>
<p id="2YRqLQ"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/"><em><strong>Animal Well</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong>Again, I tell you that I am neither smart enough or patient enough to appreciate this game. But my colleagues (and practically every other game critic) adore this game. A potential GOTY contender, they say. A strike against my tastes, they say. I’ll never be forgiven for watching the ending on YouTube rather than solving the puzzle on my own, they say.</p>
<p id="KwMhhU"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/"><em><strong>Hades 2</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> This feels like cheating. But this <em>is</em> a game made by a small independent studio. And <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses">it is awesome</a>. And it was released in May. Those are the metrics for this exercise! I can’t leave it off the list just because its predecessor happened to win <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22167819/hades-game-of-the-year-2020">Polygon’s Game of the Year in 2020</a>.</p>

<p id="Nr2UkW">May 2024 should be remembered as one of the greatest months of all time for smaller games from smaller studios, and yet, it might not be. Because this, perhaps, hints at a new normal. In April, we got <em>Minishoot Adventures</em>,<em> Another Crab’s Treasure</em>,<em> Felvidek</em>,<em> Snufkin</em>,<em> Maniac</em>,<em> Harold Halibut</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Children of the Sun</em>. Before that, we got games as small as <em>Balatro </em>and large as <em>Palworld</em>. </p>
<p id="MFctd6">More people are making more games than at any point in history. And for these smaller teams, game development is getting easier and cheaper, at the exact moment it’s becoming more difficult and expensive for their AAA peers.</p>
<p id="BnmqK5">The video game industry is changing. How it will shake out will take time to see. There is, however, hope to be found in a month like May, and a year like 2024, when so many artists put so much greatness into the world. Sometimes it’s a little difficult to notice, without big PR teams and expensive ad campaigns, but we’re living in a time of plenty. </p>

The BHF estimated it could bring upwards of $11,000 for the charity, which funds medical research of heart and circulatory diseases and aims to raise public awareness of these issues.</p><p>A collaboration between Xbox, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/05/24/hulk-review">the Hulk film</a>, and Pepsi saw 50 of the consoles made to give away to winners of a competition. UK residents tasked with watching Hulk at the cinema, who purchased a Pepsi and popcorn meal deal, received a scratchcard which offered a chance of winning the bright green hardware.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/hulk-1717774161011.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Only 50 of these Hulk-themed Xbox consoles were made.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Only 36 people actually won a console, and only around 20 of them are known to exist today, more than two decades later, according to the BHF. The Xbox bears resemblance to a limited edition Mountain Dew console released in the U.S., but as 5,000 of those were made, the Hulk version is much more rare.</p><p>The console was confirmed to be fully working by the BHF's Paul Smith, who is thankfully an avid gamer and noticed the console was particularly unusual.</p><p>"We test all the electrical donations we receive, and this one really caught my eye," he said. "I’m a games enthusiast myself but the rare green color combined with the Hulk and Pepsi logo really stood out. Whoever is lucky enough to snap this up will make their friends green with envy.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Whoever is lucky enough to snap this up will make their friends green with envy.</p></div><p>If this incredibly rare piece of bizarre Xbox history isn't enough to entice a bid out of fans, it even comes with five games: Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, and a French version of Bilbo the Hobbit.</p><p>Microsoft is still a fan of releasing ridiculous limited edition consoles via competitions 21 years later, as its current Xbox Series X and S consoles have received myriad wild and wacky colorways.

Make your way over to this waterfall and, as you approach it, a text box will appear asking you if you want to go into the AFK chamber. Select yes and you'll reach the AFK screen. Here you can see how many Emeralds and how much Gold you've earned, as well as how long you have before your next supply of rewards comes in. When you're ready to leave or get back to the game, press the <strong>Claim </strong>button to add all of your accumulated rewards to your account.</p><p>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>2K Games is expected to show the first trailer footage of the upcoming <em>Civilization VII</em> as part of this weekend's Summer Games Fest marketing extravaganza after a logo for the game leaked on 2K's website this morning.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed gamers at <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-leaked-in-2k-games-website.892344/">ResetEra</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/">Reddit</a> both <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZZHyNzS">noticed the <em>Civ VII</em> banner</a> atop the publisher's official site early this morning, alongside a "Coming Soon" label and inactive links to a trailer and wishlist page. The appearance comes just ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZzia5NrMuU">the trailer-filled Summer Games Fest livestream</a>, which will premiere at 5 pm Eastern Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>In May, the Summer Games Fest Twitter account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/">teased</a> that 2K would be using the event "to reveal the next iteration in one of [its] biggest and most beloved franchises." <em>Civilization VII</em> now seems primed to fill that pre-announced slot, which may be unwelcome news for fans of 2K-owned franchises like <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Bioshock</em>, and <em>NFL2K</em> (which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/2ks-new-nfl-video-game-will-be-a-non-simulation-whatever-that-means/">first publicly mulled for a revival in 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Last year, developer Firaxis announced that it had started development on the "next mainline game in the world-famous <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization</em> franchise," under the guidance of <em>Civilization VI</em> Creative Director Ed Beach and newly promoted studio head Heather Hazen (who previously worked with Epic Games and Popcap). "We have plans to take the Civilization franchise to exciting new heights for our millions of players around the world," Hazen <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/a-new-era-begins-at-firaxis-games">said in a statement</a> at the time.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/firaxicon39.png" data-height="683" data-width="1024" alt="<em>Civilization </em>namesake Sid Meier holds forth with fans at a Firaxicon fan gathering in 2014."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/firaxicon39.png" data-height="683" data-width="1024">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Civilization </em>namesake Sid Meier holds forth with fans at a Firaxicon fan gathering in 2014.</p><p>Kyle Orland</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Civilization VII</em> will be the first entry in the storied strategy franchise in at least eight years, a historically long gap for a series that has seen a new numbered entry every four to six years since its debut in 1991. When <em>Civilization VI</em> hit in 2016, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/civilization-vi-impressions-more-than-500-turns-can-tell/">we praised the game</a> for its smoother, more easily accessible interface and focus on fraught decision-making.
</p><p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/sid-meier-reflects-on-25-years-of-civilization/">an interview with Ars</a> just after the launch of <em>Civ VI</em>, series namesake Sid Meier said his official role as franchise director has evolved over the years into more of a support structure for younger designers. "I'm there to kind of represent the history of the game," Meier told Ars. "My role is just to be supportive. Designers have huge egos, and they're easily bruised. Making a game can be a painful process. Part of my role is to be encouraging—'that idea didn't work, try something else.'"
</p><p>Elsewhere in early Summer Games Fest leaks and announcements, we can expect more info about <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/batman-arkham-shadow/">Meta Quest VR-exclusive <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em></a>, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/">Lego-fied version of Sony's <em>Horizon</em> series</a>, and new footage for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">cinematic survival game <em>Dune Awakening</em></a>, among many other planned announcements.</p>

One thing that does remain a constant is Xur, as the friendly arms dealer is ready to offer Exotic and Legendary-class weapons to anyone looking to triumph in the Pale Heart. There have been some big changes to Xur's inventory, including a chance to get some classic Exotic weapon catalysts, and he now also has his own rewards program.

Here's where you can find Xur this week and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur in <strong>The Tower</strong>, inside the <strong>Hangar</strong>. For his weapons, Xur is offering the <strong>Sunshot</strong> and <strong>Jotunn</strong> catalysts. Hunters can pick up <strong>Raiju's Harness</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Lion Rampant</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Verity's Brow</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314878-destiny22024-06-0719-15-48.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314878-destiny22024-06-0719-15-48.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314878"></a><figcaption>Xur's location--as indicated by the IX mark--in the Tower.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314878-destiny22024-06-0719-15-48.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314879-destiny22024-06-0719-17-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314880-destiny22024-06-0719-17-23.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314879,1300-4314880" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4314879-destiny22024-06-0719-17-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4314880-destiny22024-06-0719-17-23.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314879-destiny22024-06-0719-17-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314880-destiny22024-06-0719-17-23.jpg"></figure><p>Instead of being in the hangar, Xur is now in the Bazaar area of the Tower. When you spawn in, go right, down the stairs, and into the main marketplace. Xur can be found in the corner, where Eva Levante used to set up shop during seasonal events like the Dawning.</p><h2>Xur Exotic and Legendary Items</h2><p>One of the big changes with Xur this year is that he only accepts Strange Coins, now that Legendary Shards have been sunset. This is a full circle moment, as back in the original Destiny, Exotics could also only be purchased from Xur with Strange Coins. Another big change is that Xur now has a vendor reputation rank that can be increased by making purchases with him, and some of his rewards include Exotic engrams, Enhancement Cores, and an Exotic Cipher.</p><p>The biggest change here?

Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.
</p>
<p>
There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">the Half Sword demo</a> - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

You begin the demo slumped over in a flat void that stretches away forever. You wander to the nearest weaponisable object - if you're lucky, a nice, solid pitchfork - then wander a bit further in search of people to stick that object into. Or at least, flail it at. In Half Sword, weapons are swung by jolting the cursor around or yanking the analog sticks. As such, it's rare even with practice that you land what feels like a clean blow. Instead, you sort of stroke and tickle each other with your implements of bloodshed until one of the participants ragdolls, screeching and blasting blood everywhere. People certainly do <em>yell</em> in Half Sword, though it's partly, again, that the controls and handling don't lend themselves to swift and merciful KOs. Knock somebody over and you're obliged to stand over them sort of massaging your weapon into them until they stop bellowing and cop it out of sheer irritation. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible, as you'd expect, that all this reflects my own ineptness, though the blundering and absurd inhumanity of it all is a fair representation of the IRL fights I have been involved in. Regardless, it's very funny. "Proper" physics-based melee combat systems have been a thing in games for years, but they never fail to make me cackle. There are some Gang Beasts-worthy moments in Half Sword, albeit with a lot more gore. At one point I managed to knock a guy down while dropping my axe, which clattered to a halt a few metres away. Rather than give the downed opponent time to get up while I fetched it, I seized his ankle and dragged him kicking and screaming towards the axe. Then I stepped on the axe and hurt myself, and he stood up and beat my head in with a footstool. Touché, good sir knight. I'll see you at the next Roundtable.
</p>
<p>
The full version of Half Sword promises to be "an immersive, physically simulated medieval combat game that offers players a unique experience of becoming a commoner-turned-knight, fighting brutal tournaments in 15th-century Europe". It'll feature a "meticulously crafted collection of historically accurate arms and armor", NPCs with quests, and many flourishes based on "the expertise and feedback of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) practitioners and sword fencers". Sounds decent, but I'd also love to play an expanded version of the demo that abstracts the rags-to-riches theme into a bunch of random, ignoble fights in the dark for possession of some truly awful hats.

The prolific studio behind works like <em>FLCL</em>, <em>Gurren Lagann</em>, and the legendary <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion </em>has been struggling financially for several years. On June 7, the company announced it’s filing for bankruptcy and closing down.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Despite the prestige associated with the studio, Gainax has been dealing with financial woes throughout its nearly 40-year history. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-studio-gainax-goes-bankrupt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-studio-gainax-goes-bankrupt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span> lays out, the studio had been marred by production issues, tax fraud in the ‘90s, and multiple lawsuits —including some involving Studio Khara, which was founded by Gainax founder and <em>Evangelion</em> director Hideaki Anno. All of these issues snowballed over the decades until finally a debt collection company filed a lawsuit against Gainax this May, leading to a bankruptcy filing on May 29. A statement on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gainax.co.jp/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gainax.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company’s official website</a></span> explains that the company had racked up a lot of debt, especially in the years since 2012. The studio lays the blame at the feet of company management, who operated the company as if it were their private property, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gainax-the-studio-behind-the-evangelion-series-goes-bankrupt-amidst-unmanageable-debt/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gainax-the-studio-behind-the-evangelion-series-goes-bankrupt-amidst-unmanageable-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Automaton</em>’s</a></span> translation.</p><p>The studio is closing, but the Gainax trademark has been transferred to Studio Khara. That company has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.khara.co.jp/2024/06/07/240607/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.khara.co.jp/2024/06/07/240607/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released its own statement</a></span> on its website, explaining that while Anno left the company in 2007 and became a shareholder at Gainax, attempts by him and others to correct the studio’s poor management could not right the ship given its decades of debt. Studio Khara will work to transfer IP rights to companies and creatives. The statement signs off expressing regret that Gainax’s work has ended on this note.</p><p>It is a shame that Gainax came crashing down like this, and even as someone who has watched all of <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> and its movies, I didn’t realize just how fraught the studio’s situation had been over the years until I saw the bankruptcy news. Just another reminder that even companies that create some of the most beloved works in their medium can be a trainwreck internally. What a disaster.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">While it's nice to see an overt reference to Bloodborne, the fact that it comes alongside a skin for a "legacy" character that hasn't starred in a new game since 2002 doesn't exactly instill confidence. Still, it's a reminder that Sony is well-aware of the large contingent of Yharnamite fans out there, even if the company is content to leave those fans disappointed for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors of a Bloodborne remake from Bluepoint (which co-developed the PS5 Demon's Souls remake) have swirled for years, but they've never been officially confirmed or denied. Earlier this year, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki told Eurogamer that any such remake or sequel would be up to Sony, and said that it's possible that Sony may wait until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theoretical-bloodborne-remake-could-receive-value-from-new-hardware-miyazaki-says/1100-6521268/">it releases new hardware</a> to remake the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="151" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Euro 2024 mode is a must-play for all <em>EA FC 24</em> players, and EA Sports has ensured that it can attract the interest of beginners and veterans alike.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Like the World Cup 2022 mode in <em>FIFA 23</em>, the Euro content is exclusive and unlikely to appear in the next four games. The entire UEFA Euro mode is fully licensed, translating into authentic squads, historic moments, and many other things. Ultimately, the objective is to rewrite your history, and here are five teams that can help you do that.</p> <h2 id="h-5-best-teams-in-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode" data-injectable="false">5 best teams in EA FC 24 Euro 2024 mode</h2> <h2 id="h-france" data-injectable="false">France</h2> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The French national side has a wealth of talents all over the pitch. Kylian Mbappe alone is a handful for any defense in <em>EA FC 24</em>. He’s arguably the most meta attacker you can control in any game mode, including the Euro 2024 mode. He’s well supported by the likes of Griezmann, Coman, and company, all of whom are viable attackers in their own rights. The defense has stars like Upamecano, Kounde, and Theo Hernandez, while the midfield is well marshaled by the Real Madrid duo Camavinga and Tchouameni. Youngsters like Zaire-Emery and Bradley Barcola add an X-factor on top of it all.</p>
 <h2 id="h-netherlands" data-injectable="false">Netherlands</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="807" data-injectable="true">Whether the Netherlands is among the top five teams in the real-life tournament can be up for debate. However, the team is exceptionally strong in terms of the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode. The defense has Virgil Van Dijk, the best defender in the game. Matthijs De Ligt and Nathan Ake have also proven themselves at club level. The midfield has the star power of Frenkie De Jong, and the duo of Koopmeiners and Simmons have had fantastic seasons. In attack, you get the services of Cody Gakpo and Memphis Depay.</p>
 <h2 id="h-portugal" data-injectable="false">Portugal</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="574" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Portugal is full of players who perform well in the game’s meta. They’re led by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-do-siuu-in-ea-fc-24/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who, despite all the nerfs, continues to be a dominant performer in front of the goal. The duo of Joao Felix and Rafael Leao are efficient dribblers. The midfield offers you the duo of Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes. They have their limitations, but you can’t find better football passers. The defense might appear weak initially, but Joao Cancelo, Nuno Mendes, and Ruben Dias are there. Portugal is a solid squad to pick in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode.</p>
 <h2 id="h-italy" data-injectable="false">Italy</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">This new generation of Italians has a lot of strong performers in its ranks. Donnarumma is one of the best keepers in the game if not the best, and the defense has players like Di Lorenzo and Bastoni. Nicolo Barella can control the midfield well, while Chiesa is an excellent wide attacker. The squad also includes utility options like Lorenzo Pellegrini, Gianluca Mancini, and Giacomo Raspadori. This team might not have big stars, but there’s a solid defensive foundation and overall balance.</p>
 <h2 id="h-england" data-injectable="false">England</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="881" data-injectable="false">Both Spain and Germany are hard to turn down, but the latter lacks a solid striker, while the former could fit better in the game’s meta. This English side, present in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> Euro 2024 tournament mode, has some unique talents. Who better than Jude Bellingham to boss your midfield? Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden offer a lot of creativity, while Declan Rice is a great defensive screen. Harry Kane might not be quick, but he has precise finishing skills. The defense has great wing backs and defensively robust center-backs, making England an excellent choice in the Euro mode.</p>
