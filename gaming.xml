            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">blog post</a> on the Call of Duty website, publisher Activision directly addressed the fact that there has been a growing conversation around Call of Duty having an identity crisis, and confirmed that "<em>operators, operator skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</em>."</p>



<p>It's a bit of a surprising move, in a sense, because the idea that Call of Duty is not what it once was is a conversation that's been around since we started to see celebrity operator skins and fictional characters added into the game like it was a more realistically stylized version of Fortnite. It's not exactly a new talking point. </p>



<p>But now that Battlefield 6 has stormed in and<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/"> proved that there are thousands, if not millions</a>, of players, who don't care about playing as Cheech and Chong, Rambo, or Nicki Minaj in their realistic military FPS, Activision is ready to try and prove that Call of Duty hasn't forgotten its roots.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>First off, thank you. Call of Duty has always been fueled by the community. Every match, every clip, every bit of feedback; you‚Äôve shaped this franchise right alongside us. </p><p>We know there‚Äôs been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/q9egebdlMD">pic.twitter.com/q9egebdlMD</a></p></div>‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1960390735305335176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We know there's been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you</em>," the post reads. </p>



<p>It continues to say that the "<em>north star</em>" for Treyarch and Raven in developing Black Ops 7 has been to create a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2, which remains one of the more beloved games in the entire Call of Duty series. That's been the goal, but Activision stipulates they've strived for that "<em>while taking some big swings</em>."</p>



<p>Whether Treyarch and Raven achieve in creating a Black Ops 2 spiritual successor remains to be seen, but in regards to giving Black Ops 7 its own spotlight, that's where cancelling the carry forward with Black Ops 6 comes in. </p>



<p>"<em>Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting,</em>" Activision writes. "<em>That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</em>" Warzone will remain the Call of Duty melting pot it is though, as Activision confirms that Warzone "<em>is not affected</em>" by this change, and that you'll still be able to access your Black Ops 6 operators, skins, and weapons, in Warzone.</p>



<p>The blog post continues to say that we'll have more information on how Black Ops 7 will retain the Call of Duty identity as an "<em>immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded</em>" shooter in the coming weeks, and reminds readers that Call of Duty NEXT will take place on September 30, which will include the multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 ahead of its first beta the following weekend.</p>



<p>This post might be what Activision thinks Call of Duty players want to hear, but those actually concerned that the series has lost its identity won't be satisfied with words alone. Those minds will be shifted by actions alone, and we'll see how Activision approaches its collaborations for Black Ops 7, and if players will continue to run around dressed up as celebrities and cartoon characters in multiplayer matches. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, but there's a clear subset of the Call of Duty community that could do without it.</p>



<p>Besides, not once in this post does Activision say they won't be doing that with Black Ops 7, and with the no-carry forward not applying to Warzone, players looking for that experience will likely still find it there.</p>

Swift announced their engagement on her Instagram account with the caption, ‚ÄúYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.‚Äù While the comments are turned off (as they are with every post on her profile), as you can imagine, the internet is losing its mind. ‚ÄúWhy are you writing about Taylor Swift on a video game website?‚Äù </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><span>She was in </span><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a><span>, leave me alone.</span></p> <p><span>Love them, hate them, or feel nothing for them, Swift and Kelce are America‚Äôs sweethearts. The general public is already greatly invested in Swift‚Äôs love life, since her songs and the mythos around her have etched the 35-year-old pop star‚Äôs romantic ups and downs into modern pop culture folklore, and seeing her in a relationship that seemingly lacks the kinds of dramatic complications you write albums about has prompted fans to root for this relationship to be the one that works out. A lot of people have been tuned into the lore for years, and for those who have treated Swift‚Äôs love life as a story they‚Äôve been watching unfold, it‚Äôs basically like watching a slow-burn romance finally reach its next stage.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged <a href="https://t.co/MpS8BLPOZj">pic.twitter.com/MpS8BLPOZj</a></p> <p>‚Äî Siobhan ‚ú® (@Siobachka) <a href="https://twitter.com/Siobachka/status/1960389888366219708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I AM SO HAPPY FOR MY CLOSE AND PERSONAL FRIEND TAYLOR SWIFT <a href="https://t.co/O2gBDwphSa">pic.twitter.com/O2gBDwphSa</a></p> <p>‚Äî pippa (@piptweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/piptweets/status/1960388307847631020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally crying for my close and personal friend taylor swift <a href="https://t.co/65TZrdVhVq">pic.twitter.com/65TZrdVhVq</a></p> <p>‚Äî burcu ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• (@thatsoburcu) <a href="https://twitter.com/thatsoburcu/status/1960388498931769581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">taylor is finally living her fairytale dreams that she would write songs about as a teenager someone SEDATE ME <a href="https://t.co/NcQraMZkUZ">pic.twitter.com/NcQraMZkUZ</a></p> <p>‚Äî Taylor Swift Updates (@SwiftNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftNYC/status/1960391657104294356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do i explain to my nervous system that i‚Äôm not being held at gunpoint and it‚Äôs just taylor swift announced her engagement?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-bloober-wants-to-conquer-the-world-again.1281147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team‚Äôs journey could easily be the plot of a Hollywood film. Since the release of Layers of Fear in 2016, the Polish studio has experienced a rollercoaster of hits and misses, often delivering titles that were met with mixed reactions from both players and critics.</p>



<p>But everything changed in 2024 with the launch of Silent Hill 2 Remake. Bloober nailed it‚Äîreviving one of the most iconic survival horror games with a fresh yet respectful approach. The remake‚Äôs success catapulted the studio‚Äôs reputation, establishing them as true craftsmen of psychological horror. Naturally, expectations for their next original IP, Cronos: The New Dawn, skyrocketed.</p>



<p>Thanks to an invitation from Bloober Team, I had the chance to play the first 30 minutes of the game during a hands-on demo at Gamescom 2025‚Äîand I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-preview-meet-the-traveler">Cronos: The New Dawn Preview ‚Äì Meet the Traveler</h2>



<p>In Cronos: The New Dawn, you play as the Traveler‚Äîa kind of soldier dispatched by an entity known as the Collective to a bleak future. Your mission? Travel back to 1980s Poland and rescue select individuals from a catastrophic event.</p>



<p>The opening moments are intentionally cryptic. Who are the Travelers? What is the Collective‚Äôs true role? And what exactly caused the event? The game throws these questions at you, trusting the narrative to unravel them gradually.</p>



<p>During my session, I came across several collectibles that added depth to the world and enriched the immersive storytelling Bloober is known for. Surprisingly, the combat reminded me a lot of <em>Dead Space</em>‚Äîin the best way possible.</p>



<p>The Traveler starts off equipped with a pistol capable of two firing modes: a standard shot and a charged blast that deals heavy damage and can interrupt enemy charges.</p>



<p>Ammo is scarce, so melee combat becomes essential. You can punch enemies to create space and escape quickly‚Äîespecially since their reaction time is fast. One standout mechanic is ‚Äúfusion‚Äù: if a living enemy reaches the corpses of two fallen foes, it can merge with them, becoming faster and more powerful. To prevent this, the Traveler can deploy a flame cylinder that burns bodies on the ground.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deixar os inimigos se fundirem resulta em grandes problemas</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-intuition-and-isolation">Intuition and Isolation</h2>



<p>I don‚Äôt usually play survival horror games, but <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> made me reconsider‚Äîlargely thanks to its smart level design. Exploration, environmental puzzles, and progression are all intuitive and never frustrating. With a bit of attention, even genre newcomers can navigate the world with ease.</p>



<p>The intuitive design is paired with a haunting sense of isolation. Cold color palettes dominate the environments, reinforcing the feeling of desolation. The world has ended‚Äîand chaos is all that remains. Complementing the visuals are eerie sound effects and a retrofuturistic soundtrack that blends synthetic tones with organic instruments.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-bloober-do-it-again">Can Bloober Do It Again?</h2>



<p>By the end of the demo, I didn‚Äôt want to stop playing. The immersive atmosphere, the unanswered questions, and the brutal, strategic combat left me eager for more. Based on what I played, Cronos: The New Dawn is shaping up to be another major win for Bloober Team.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won‚Äôt need to wait long to see if the final game is great or not. <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> launches on September 5th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

Most importantly, with a spread of colors, the Crocs manage to capture a pretty robust picture of the island featured in New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top of the Crocs is a soft green color, with images of the classic Animal Crossing trees, while the platform heel features blue and white ocean waves. A yellow line separates the two, acting as the beach. The heel grip has similar blue and white tones to the platform, but to create the effect of clouds in the sky. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The base pair of Crocs also comes with six ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù Jibbitz that aren‚Äôt available for purchase individually. These include K.K. Slider, Timmy and Tommy, Tom Nook, Isabelle, a weirdly tall house, and a classic fruit tree. As far as we know, everyone gets apples, but it would be a cute gimmick if the fruits were randomized. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Additional Jibbitz Charms Can Be Purchased Separately</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The more challenging decision is whether to pick up any additional charms. The Creator set features the always-fashionable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/How_to_Unlock_Able_Sisters_Shop">Able Sisters</a> as well as the shirt and backpack icons used throughout the series. The Collector set features, as you‚Äôd expect, three characters that help you build your various collections: the museum-keeper <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/blathers">Blathers</a>, his stargazing younger sister Celeste, and the art dealer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/redd">Jolly Redd</a>. You also get the fossil and seashell icons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we have the special ‚Äúsingle charms‚Äù you can currently only find online at the Crocs store. One can only imagine how Nintendo or Crocs decided on these, but for around $5, you can grab a single charm of one of your <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Villagers_and_Special_Characters">neighboring villagers</a>. At this time, your only options are Bunnie, Rosie, or Marshal, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the charm line expanded to include more characters down the line (<em>cough, </em>Raymond).  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is the first Crocs and Animal Crossing crossover, it isn‚Äôt anywhere close to the first fashion collaboration for Nintendo. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-converse-sneakers-collab-pikachu-eevee-mewtwo-charizard">Pok√©mon crossed over with Converse</a> back in 2022, while Levi‚Äôs once stocked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-levis-denim-collection-revealed">a full Super Mario collection</a>. Puma featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/puma-animal-crossing-crossover-sneakers">Animal Crossing and other Nintendo properties</a> on a range of activewear back in 2021. Most of these collections quickly sold our or were otherwise in limited stock, so it's a good shout to grab a collaboration like this before it's only available on the resell market. </p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 26, 2025 5:16 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-and-charms-are-now-available]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>‚ÄúCommunity is the heart of skateboarding, and it‚Äôs the heart of&nbsp;skate.,‚Äù</em> said Jeff Seamster, Head of Creative on Skate<i>.</i><em> ‚ÄúFrom day one, we‚Äôve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We‚Äôve built this game alongside our community ‚Äì listening, learning and evolving together. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned skater or just dropped in,&nbsp;skate.&nbsp;is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers ‚Äì just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we‚Äôre hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>In Skate, players will be able to roll, grind, and ollie around the city of San Vansterdam which will be a large open world, with plenty of places to pull of tricks. San Vansterdam is split into four different neighbourhoods which are Hedgemont, Gullcrest, Market Mile and Brickswich. Each area has its own challenges and unique designs. To pull off various moves, the Flick-It system is going to be the key as it will be offering precision and control. New tricks are being added to Skate as well, and these are wallies, slappies and firecrackers. Additional features like Quick Drop will allow players to add ramps and rails to areas, allowing customisation that will allow refreshing of areas.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were able to go hands-on with The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and speak to two of the key developers from MachineGames (Lead Game Designer Ezekiel Virant and Creative Director Axel Torvenius) as they led us through the making of this expansion, which will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and will eventually be available on Nintendo Switch 2 next year once the game launches there. Let's begin with the developers' words.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> The Order of Giants DLC's premise is that we set out to place the beginning of the DLC inside the Vatican sandbox, so you need to have played the game up to a certain point in the Vatican sandbox, and if you have the DLC installed, we have this new character called Father Orlando Ricci. When you interact with him, he will trigger a cutscene, which activates the DLC.</p>



<p>Father Ricci is obviously very, very obsessed with finding this secret chamber. He's also hinted that Father Ventura is onto him and that he's being forced out of the Vatican, which hints to the fact that only a small part of the DLC takes place inside the Vatican sandbox, maybe 10 or 15 minutes of gameplay, but then we quite quickly push the players to a complete new path, which is the streets of the Rome and the Tiber river and all the places underneath. Even the spaces in the Vatican sandbox were visible but inaccessible in the base game.</p>



<p>As you explore the DLC, you'll find lots of clues and hints, similar to what we did in the base game, in all the Chapters. We have tons of notes for you to find and fill out Indiana's journal. There are around 70 new collectibles in the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> You can take this mission anytime in the campaign, really, even if you've already completed the game and you have a save and buy The Order of Giants DLC, you can still fast travel back here and start this mission, so there's no need to start a whole new game. As soon as you've gotten the camera and met Gina, you're good to go with the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> From the moment you enter the casina onward, everything is completely new content. At the beginning of the DLC's production, we thought we should reuse some stuff, but in the end, not much has been reused from the main game. Basically, everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new.</p>



<p><strong>So none of this is cut content from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Exactly, it's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game, but obviously, there were some things when we were working on the main game where we were already planning for this. The concept images and stuff like that. We knew that we were going to hopefully be able to dive deeply into this part of the narrative with The Order of Giants.</p>

It's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It was one of the big mysteries of the game, after all.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, so it's one of those nice opportunities to finally be able to actually do a DLC that dives a little bit deeper into the mystery of it.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We also have all-new puzzle mechanics. We are not recycling any of the old mechanics from other areas. There is a mix of big and small puzzles to get that balance between them.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> By the way, you can fast travel in and out of the DLC as you see fit.</p>



<p><strong>Is The Order of the Giants DLC harder than the base game when it comes to combat and/or puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> I think the puzzles lean towards being a little bit more difficult than the base game, actually, but of course, we still have hints. And we also still have the adventure mode if you want to have a simpler time in some of the puzzles. In terms of the combat, depending on where you are with the base game, the game will actually scale the difficulty. So, if you're starting right from the Vatican, it will be easier, but if you're in the endgame, the enemies will be more challenging.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> We will also be connecting the dots from certain narrative threads seen in the main game. Moreover, in terms of visual fidelity, everything that you'll see in the DLC is at a minimum as good-looking and polished as in the base game, and in some instances, it's even better. Similar to what we have in the main game as well, everything starts with a small mystery and then grows from there. In The Order of Giants, Father Ricci asks you to find the secret chamber and the giant helmet found within, but there's much more to it, so Indiana will have to keep digging.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We have multiple larger puzzles like this one in the DLC, similar to the base game. There are a lot of layers and mechanics, new mechanics, and we're truly trying to push the player all around the environment. This is one of the brand-new mechanics that we started working on immediately after the base game wrapped up. In most Indiana Jones adventures, the puzzles that he unravels start with him figuring out the mechanics, and then once he gets into a good flow, something breaks, and he has to clear the breakage or do something else.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>What we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Did you incorporate any feedback from the players' experience with the base game into the design of these new puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah, we've watched a lot of players while they interact with our puzzles. I think what we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</p>



<p>The designer who worked on this puzzle had an idea to rotate something with a wrench, and players could slot the wrench in and out. Then, another designer who had been working on the redirection maze for a while joined him to create this one.</p>



<p>One unique aspect of developing these puzzles compared to those from the base game is that they were finally done in our office. Most of those in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were made during COVID, when people were forced to work remotely. This is the first time the people could meet physically to design them.</p>



<p>There are more secrets to be found on the levels. Something that we've always tried to maintain is to allow for new paths to open, for new secrets to be revealed, so there's always this layering of the environments where you dig deeper and find something new, and depending on your playstyle, you may be able to find more stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> This traversal section is one that was just so super inspired. One of the designers who worked on this was someone who didn't do a big traversal section throughout the main game, but we had the opportunity to try a lot of new ideas with the DLC. Since the engine was in such a good shape that we had all the mechanics nailed down, it was easy for us to experiment and make new things without having to worry about bugs. This traversal scenario here, where you deal with pulleys and weights and moving up and down, shows off this brand new mechanics; it's a whole new way of using the whip.</p>



<p>This whole level here is like that. We started designing new mechanics and new features. We began by putting together a fresh view of mechanics with this rope and these pulleys. The designer had it in their mind, and I think they actually tried to do it a year or two ago, but only had the opportunity to make it work and get all the tech pieces in place for The Order of Giants DLC. When we first started doing this level design and walking it out, we actually found that it was getting longer, but people were having a lot of fun, so we increased the scope and the complexity of this whole scenario, just based on just internal player feedback. We felt it would be a missed opportunity otherwise.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate of the length of The Order of Giants DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter. But I've been playing through the final build back home in the studio and I think I'm at, like, four and a half hours, but then I know everything. Some of the puzzles can be very challenging even at medium difficulty, but that's why we also have easy difficulty available. If you don't want to spend too much time on puzzles, you should still be able to navigate through and continue the adventure. </p>



<p>I think it's important to emphasize that this is not a puzzle DLC. It's still primarily a story-driven narrative DLC. The balance here is similar to what we have in the base game: large puzzles, small puzzles, hard combat, light combat, cutscenes, set pieces, tense action, even some boss fight. Everything that was in the main game is represented in the DLC as well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Basically, everything players loved about the base game, they're getting more of it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yep. Exactly the same type of tone, sensation, same humor and everything. It's very much like an extension of the main game. I think that's something we felt was very correct to do, because we're still telling a new, standalone, unique adventure, a new story. But we saw so much feedback from the player community where people were like, we want more Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Finally, we had the opportunity to get the DLC out, which is just doing that. It's adding more to the beloved world of Indiana Jones.</p>



<p><strong>Earlier, you talked about the game's fidelity, which is already great. But I know that you are also improving upon it with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-hair-coming-september-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming RTX Hair update</a>. Can you talk about that a bit?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> I can't go into technical details, but what we're happy to see is that the development and integration of RTX Hair makes it so much better. Actually, there's a lot of things in the game that can benefit from it, because many things utilize the hair system, not just hair itself. It's a system that is used over other aspects as well. Everything that is fur or hair-related will have better render fidelity.</p>



<p>Some people may think it's a small thing, but there are all those small things that add up. The details and everything just make everything come together. We are really happy with the RTX Hair integration.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-nintendo-switch-2-release-order-of-the-giants-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a Switch 2 version</a>, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, it will be released next year.</p>



<p><strong>Are you doing that internally, or is that work being outsourced?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yes, most of the work is done internally. Our CTO, the engineers, and the programmers are working on it to ensure it is as good as we can possibly make it on a handheld platform.</p>



<p><strong>You already ported the previous Wolfenstein games to Nintendo Switch, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yes, both the last two Wolfenstein games. It's a continuation of Machinegames bringing the titles to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Which is great. As a developer, you want to own as many as possible so that your game can be enjoyed, so we were very happy with the Switch 2 confirmation.</p>



<p><strong>One last question. Can you share whether there will be more of Gina in this DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Gina is not part of the DLC. This is more of Indiana Jones going on a little bit of a rogue adventure on the side. Gina is most likely still back undercover in the Vatican, doing some research at this point.</p>



<p>That was one of the reasons we wanted to really focus on Indiana Jones and the core of the IP to push him on a side quest. Obviously, we have a lot of sections in the main game where we do things together with Gina, which is nice because we want that balance. She's an important character, but we also see that it's cool when you're completely alone and you get the sensation that it's only up to you to solve the mystery, so it fits in within that balance too.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah. I think Indie is a bit distracted at this point and he wants to keep searching and pushing, whereas Gina is really on a beeline to find her sister.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In The Order of Giants DLC, you'll see Father Ricci, but there are also appearances of Father Ventura and Mussolini as well.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Based on what we played at Gamescom 2025, The Order of Giants looks like a thoughtful extension of what people (the undersigned included) already loved about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: awesome graphics, outstanding puzzles, and great atmosphere. There are also some interesting new platforming mechanics, too, especially those based around Indy's whip. The demo only featured a very brief combat scene, but according to the developers, fans should expect roughly the same split between combat, exploration, and narrative that made the base game so great.</p>



<p>There's not much to wait to experience the new content, with the DLC slated to hit all platforms on September 4. Look forward to our review soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision and Treyarch are making a big change to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, just under 12 weeks before its launch in November. All those wacky cosmetics from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry over to the new sequel as previously promised. The devs behind <em>Call of Duty</em> say the change is to ensure <em>Black Ops 7</em> is ‚Äúauthentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting.‚Äù</p> <p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">On August 26</a>, in a lengthy community update posted on the official <em>Call of Duty</em> website, Treyarch thanked fans for all the feedback and acknowledged the ongoing conversation online surrounding crossover skins and wacky cosmetic items in video games.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe know there‚Äôs been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of <em>Call of Duty,</em>‚Äù said the studio. ‚ÄúSome of you have said we‚Äôve drifted from what made <em>Call of Duty</em> unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.‚Äù</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="COD x Beavis &amp; Butt-Head | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjaKA57mnu8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Players were worried that the weird cosmetics and crossover skins from <em>Black Ops 6</em> would immediately turn<em> Black Ops 7</em> into a <em>Fortnite</em>-like experience. That‚Äôs because the plan was to let skins from <em>BLOPS 6, </em>which now includes characters like Beavis and Butt-Head, carry over to <em>BLOPS 7</em>. But that‚Äôs no longer happening.</p> <p>‚ÄúOperators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry forward into <em>Black Ops 7</em>,‚Äù announced Treyarch. <em>‚ÄúBlack Ops 7</em> needs to feel authentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting. That is why<em> Black Ops 6</em> Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to <em>Black Ops 7.</em> Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.‚Äù</p> <p>The developers of <em>Black Ops 7</em> also claimed that a ‚Äúton of feedback‚Äù has already been implemented into the game. And the studio explained that future cosmetic bundles and items added to <em>BLOPS 7</em> will be ‚Äúcrafted to fit the <em>Black Ops</em> identity.‚Äù Treyarch further added: ‚ÄúWe hear the feedback. We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core <em>Call of Duty</em> experience.‚Äù</p>

 <p>Activision did confirm that <em>BLOPS 6</em> skins will still move over to <em>Warzone</em>. So your strange collection of characters can still go enjoy battle royale.</p> <h2>Why <em>Call of Duty</em> is making this big change</h2> <p>People have been yelling online for years about <em>Call of Duty</em> skins and cosmetics going too far and feeling out of place. So why the sudden change now, just a few months before the next game‚Äôs launch?<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919"> Well, it‚Äôs likely because of <em>Battlefield 6.</em></a> EA‚Äôs upcoming shooter held an open beta earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">and it was immensely popular</a>. It is also a more grounded, gritty, and realistic war game compared to recent<em> Call of Duty</em> entries. And when EA DICE design director Shashank Uchil was asked if the studio planned to add crossover skins like Beavis and Butt-Head or Goku to <em>Battlefield 6,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">he claimed that wasn‚Äôt going to happen</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>‚ÄúIt has to be grounded,‚Äù said Uchil. ‚ÄúThat is what<em>&nbsp;BF3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BF4</em> was‚Äîit was all soldiers, on the ground. It‚Äôs going to be like this. I don‚Äôt think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let‚Äôs keep it real, keep it grounded.‚Äù</p> <p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/">Another DICE developer told <em>Comicbook</em></a>:&nbsp; ‚ÄúWhat I will say is what‚Äôs really important to us is that things feel grounded, and we want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like ‚ÄòI look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin.‚Äô But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that‚Äôs the approach we‚Äôre thinking.‚Äù</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">following last week‚Äôs reveal of a very wild-looking</a> and not at all grounded<em> Black Ops 7</em>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><em>IGN</em> asked the game‚Äôs creative director</a>, Miles Leslie, about wacky crossover skins. His answer was a big nothing burger that didn‚Äôt really commit to anything, vaguely claimed the studio would ‚Äúcalibrate‚Äù future skins based on feedback, and promised that all fans would ‚Äúfeel represented.‚Äù This answer went over poorly. And, after today‚Äôs big news that <em>Black Ops 7</em> will feature more grounded skins and won‚Äôt let <em>Black Ops 6</em> cosmetics carry over as planned, it seems the folks in charge of <em>Call of Duty</em> are trying to get the train back on the tracks in the face of October‚Äôs <em>Battlefield 6.</em> Will it be enough? I‚Äôm not sure, but it is interesting to watch <em>Call of Duty</em> react to the first serious competition it‚Äôs faced in years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/davy-x-jones-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/davy-x-jones-hands-on-preview-a-new-take-on-the-pirate-legend.1281087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to try out Davy X Jones, the latest IP from Polish studio Parasight, thanks to a special invite. Right from the start, it‚Äôs clear the team has a passion for reimagining legendary figures from human history‚Äîalways with their own unique twist.</p>



<p>Their previous title, Blacktail, retold the tale of Yaga (yes, Baba Yaga) through Parasight‚Äôs narrative lens. In Davy X Jones, as the name suggests, we step into the boots of the infamous Davy Jones, who‚Äôs on a revenge-fueled quest against Blackbeard. After being killed, Davy‚Äôs head is separated from his body‚Äîcreating a bizarre but brilliant duo of protagonists.</p>



<p>This split isn‚Äôt just for laughs (though the banter between head and body is genuinely funny); it also plays a key role in gameplay. The head performs specific actions, like devouring orbs that restore health, adding a clever layer to combat and exploration.</p>



<p>Speaking of combat, it channels the frantic energy of the DOOM franchise. Each of Jones‚Äôs arms wields a weapon‚Äîa bladed hook and a pistol. While the ranged mechanics felt solid, the melee system could use some refinement. At times, hits lacked impact. Thankfully, the game still has time to polish things up, thanks to the early access launch plan.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard was the difficulty. You need to stay on the move constantly, dodging and parrying enemy projectiles‚Äîor you‚Äôll be dead in a few hits. Sadly, the demo didn‚Äôt include any scenes with Abby, the whale-ship that serves as the game‚Äôs hub and crew management area.</p>



<p>Progression systems weren‚Äôt showcased either, so I didn‚Äôt get a taste of how character upgrades or gear improvements work. Still, I walked away impressed. Having played Parasight‚Äôs previous work, I can confidently say Davy X Jones feels more refined across the board‚Äîeven in its pre-release state. I‚Äôll definitely be diving into early access when it drops on August 28.</p>

                <p>In an unexpected statement today, Activision made a dramatic announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">no longer allow</a> players to transfer any Black Ops 6 characters, weapons, or skins to Black Ops 7. Many are taking this as a sign that Activision doesn't want Black Ops 7 to be overrun with the wacky skins that Call of Duty has become known for against a backdrop where competitor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> will only include "grounded" cosmetics.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision said it is aware of the "conversation" happening online about "the identity of Call of Duty" and the perception from some that it's "drifted" away from its identity.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," the company said.</p><p>Activision added that Black Ops 7 developers Treyarch and Raven have been guided by the goal of making a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 while at the same time "taking some big swings."</p><p>The company had previously said Black Ops 7 would included the franchise's Carry Forward feature that allows content from the past game to move forward to the next one. However, Black Ops 7 is doing away with this, and now, operators, skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</p><p>"Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7," the developer said. This only applies to Black Ops 7, as previous content will continue to carry forward to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement not long after Battlefield 6's big reveal, during which developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>The Call of Duty in-game store no doubt is a big-time money-maker, fueled in part by the kind of outlandish skins previous games have offered. It remains to be seen what kind of extra cosmetic content Activision will up-sell in Black Ops 7, or if the statement today will have any bearing on that.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta</a> begins in October. </p>

"I‚Äôm gonna say that again, to make it clear this isn‚Äôt just 'one of those things you say in a layoff message'. We TRULY wish we could keep every one of these people on the team. But we can't. This is a reflection of the tough reality we face as a business and the change needed to give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rec Room</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a chance to thrive in the years ahead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the post, the laid off workers will continue to be paid for the next three months, receive health benefits for the next six months, and have the option to keep their laptop or desktop computer.

According to Brown, the team invested "heavily in creation tools across PC, VR, consoles, and mobile," but the reality "has been harsh." The CEO claims the mobile and console versions never got to the point where "those devices were good for building stuff." Some of the efforts to bridge the gap, including the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.recroom.com/posts/maker-ai">Maker AI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> tool, frustrated the studio's "more impactful creators."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-ceo-summoned-to-court-in-harassment-case" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft CEO summoned to court in harassment case</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the same time, the lower-powered devices still fostered "millions of pieces of content," which reportedly put a strain on the team that had to come up with procedures to review it all. "Making all this run across every device was a massive technical challenge and burden.

The CEO says the studio has been stuck in an "uncomfortable middle ground" during the past few years, wondering whether to keep pushing the internal UGC vision while potentially increasing the frustration of players and the team, or scale back the vision by cutting the team in half.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Both paths were painful," Brown wrote.

			<p>Acclaim, a US-based video game publisher who you'd recognize for its success in the 1990s with games like Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Turok, NBA Jam, and a suite of movie licensed games under its belt is <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">back from the dead</a> after filing for bankruptcy in 2004. The publisher is making a grand return with its own PlayAcclaim showcase series debuting in two weeks time, on September 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Titled "<em>A New Era is Coming</em>," this showcase is set to include the publisher's "<em>upcoming lineup of titles while celebrating the brand's unforgettable legacy</em>." There are even hints at what'll be revealed, and how Acclaim is going to kickstart its comeback, according to a press release, that eagle-eyed viewers can spot in the teaser trailer released today.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="#PlayAcclaim Transmission Received: A New Era is Coming" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Acclaim is now led by Alex Josef, who prior to being the chief executive officer of this new iteration of Acclaim was the chief executive officer of publisher <a href="https://www.graffitigames.com/">Graffiti Games</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We're not here to chase ghosts,</em>" Josef said in a press release. "<em>We're here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what's coming through is something exciting and different. You can't rewrite the past, but you can build upon it. This is about owning our story and moving it into a future that feels bold, energetic, and completely fresh</em>."</p>



<p>Though this new iteration of Acclaim won't be publishing the Mortal Kombat games anymore, it'll be interesting to see what it adds to the modern videogame landscape, and for fans of the games the Acclaim used to publish, perhaps we'll see a few more series get a resurrection of their own. </p>



<p>We'll see what Josef and his team have in store in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-is-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6-to-release.1281036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta ended far too long ago already, and fans are chomping at the bit for more fast-paced, destructive action. Instead of waiting until October 10 to get their hands on Battlefield 6, hundreds of thousands of players are pouring into Battlefield 2042, sending the game rocketing back up the sales charts almost four years after launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 was a rocky title from day one, and for a while, it threatened to bring about the ‚Äòend‚Äô of the franchise. It has been a dark few years for Battlefield fans, and while Battlefield 6 is expected to be the savior of the series, Battlefield 2042 is finally getting a long-awaited moment in the sun.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-player-count-soars">Battlefield 2042 Player Count Soars</h2>



<p>Battlefield 2042 recently leapt up the charts on Steam, rocketing to 75,000 peak concurrent players and rivalling other top-tier shooters thanks to a) Battlefield 6 hype, and b) a staggering sale that dropped the game to record-low prices.</p>



<p>It was the highest peak player count Battlefield 2042 had secured on Steam <strong>since launch</strong>, provided you don‚Äôt count the free weekend in October 2023 that saw the game land 107,376 concurrent players.</p>



<figure><figcaption>That peak is really something (Source: SteamDB)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It‚Äôs safe to assume similar numbers are circulating on other platforms, particularly as Battlefield 6 draws ever closer.</p>



<p>In the most recent release of the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> newsletter, Battlefield 2042‚Äôs growth was studied by the team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 2042 <strong>sold almost 500,000 on Steam </strong>last week. While the hype for the imminent Battlefield 6 explains part of this, the real reason for its spike is a HUGE price drop, -95% to $2.99, its cheapest price yet on Steam.</p>



<p>EA often does massive fire sales like this on its legacy titles to give it revenues a boost ahead of its financials. The $1.4 million in Steam revenues from Battlefield alone is nothing to sniff at. Expect more at the end of Q3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What‚Äôs sad is that folks will be pouring into Battlefield 2042, perhaps expecting a similar experience to Battlefield 6, which many would have recently run through when the open beta was live. What they‚Äôll be getting isn‚Äôt <strong>bad</strong>, but it‚Äôs not a patch on Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into Battlefield 2042 in anticipation of Battlefield 6? Or did you pick it up just because it‚Äôs cheap? Either way, let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that Skate will launch in early access three weeks from now on September 16, 2025, bringing years of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-pre-pre-pre-alpha-signups-insider-program-testing/">closed playtesting</a> and waiting to an end. It'll be available to download for free on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Yesterday, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/">confirmed</a> that we'd get the early access release date announced and the game's cover art revealed today, with both arriving in a short trailer showing off some gameplay and introducing players to San Vansterdam.</p>

<p>The fourth entry in EA's Skate series has been long-awaited, with 15 years between Skate 3's 2010 release and this new Skate game from Full Circle. Of course, it looks very different than the trilogy of games that skateboarding fans fell in love with between 2007-2010.</p>



<p>This new Skate is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">free-to-play live service game</a>, that will feature cosmetic microtransactions and require that <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players always be online</a> if they want to hop into San Vansterdamn. It's Skate for the modern video game landscape, or more accurately, it's the only iteration of Skate that EA believes is worth making in today's video game landscape, as EA ignores the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk remasters</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Skate is not just a return, it's a complete evolution of the franchise that's built to last,</em>" said the game's executive producer, Mike McCartney, in a press release. "<em>Our goal with Skate is to capture the freedom, creative expression and community of skateboarding, and share it with as many people as possible. From day one, our priority has been to honor the legacy of the franchise while pushing it into a bold new future - one built in partnership with our players</em>."</p>



<p>While many players might not be on board with a Skate game that's potentially more focused on selling you a new colorway for your board than it is on making a good game, the fact that this is an early access release does at least mean, to some degree, Full Circle and EA will create the experience alongside player feedback. And, so long as Full Circle is able to nail the gameplay, you should be able to ignore all the live service filler you didn't ask for in your Skate game.</p>



<p>"<em>Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it‚Äôs the heart of&nbsp;</em><em>skate</em>," added the game's head of creative, Jeff Seamster. "<em>From day one, we've aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We've built this game alongside our community - listening, learning, and evolving together. Whether you're a seasoned skater or just dropped in, Skate is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers - just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we're hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Skate's early access, free-to-play journey begins in a few weeks time. Hopefully, it's a strong enough start that we're not hearing about Skate being unceremoniously shut down in less than a few years time.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> modding group have just polished off a game jam in which they challenged themselves to recreate every singleplayer map in id Software's 1996 FPS from memory alone. That is, they were forbidden from replaying the original game before they started. As Slipseer user iLike80sRock puts it, "if somehow id1 was wiped off of all computers in the world, do we collectively remember the maps well enough to recreate them?"</p><!--more-->
<p>The Quake from Memory pack has been in the works since last year. Find the finished package <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-from-memory-full-release.487/">here</a>, with installation instructions. I don't know the original Quake well enough to comment on the accuracy of the results - I was naught but a sobbing child when Quake came out, and also, a hopeless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> enthusiast. Still, I'm very interested in the concept of this jam, because when we recreate things from memory, it <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/visual-memory-distortions.html">tends to reveal some kind of bias</a>. </p>
<p>The comments on that Slipseer thread run a fun gamut. Levels are "either uncannily spot on or butchered". Some rooms are too tall, perhaps because people remember being physically smaller when they played the game, and that difference in scale has somehow bled across the gap between simulation and the flesh. Some nail traps seem to fire too fast. Some maps "are very different in ways I can't explain in words".</p>
<p>There's a sense of fascination, throughout: it's not just people complaining that the Shamblers are the wrong way round. The premise of recreating the game from memory cultivates an intrigue and a generosity not typically found in responses to certain high-fidelity videogame remasters or remakes. </p><p>In the absence of lasting, external tangible records, such as writing, remembering becomes <a href="https://historyireland.com/recycling-the-dustbin-of-irish-history-the-radical-challenge-of-folk-memory/">more of a communal practice</a>. I'm interested to know if the Quake from Memory modders were allowed to show each other their work and compare reflections, or if each mapmaker had to go it alone. "Collectively" implies the former.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I've been trying to work out if I could recreate any of my favourite games from memory. Back in the day, I could have drawn most of Sonic 2's layouts by hand, but I have played a million games since, and that squiggly hedgehog lore is lost to me. I have sharper memories of G-Police, the cyberpunk flight sim from WipEout creators Psygnosis.</p>
<p>In particular, I have quite vivid memories of one mission in which you have to stave off base assaults while tracking down and obliterating an approaching land train. The time management rigours of that mission have drummed those dome cities into my head. Still, don't come crying to me if somebody manages to delete all surviving copies of G-Police. Missions 11-16 are just hypermissile whooshing noises on repeat.</p>
<p>Which game could <em>you</em> recreate from memory alone? Thanks to RPS reader Salty for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-346?view=comments">posting about this in the latest RPS wappity</a>.</p>

              <p>Electronic Arts and developers Full Circle announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">after years of waiting</a> and fans begging for a new game, the upcoming <em>Skate</em> reboot will launch in September in early access on consoles and PC.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1960371890570023372">On August 26</a>, EA posted a short trailer for the next <em>Skate</em> game, which is confusingly just titled <em>Skate</em>, and finally confirmed an early access release date. Previously, the publisher had teased that it would be out sometime this year and later promised it would be out this summer. But now we know that the new, online-only <em>Skate</em> reboot is launching on September 16. Mark your calendars and set aside some time to kickflip. Or crash. You‚Äôll probably be crashing a lot.&nbsp; Here‚Äôs the new trailer:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are so hyped to announce that skate. will release in Early Access September 16th, 2025.

The game is set in San Vansterdam, a city built from the ground up by EA and Open Circle to be the dream playground for all skateboarders.</p> <p>It‚Äôs been a long wait for this new <em>Skate</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">EA first revealed it was working on a new <em>Skate</em> in 2020</a> after years of fans begging them to make it. Since then, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">leaked a few times</a>, and EA has put out early, unfinished footage of <em>Skate</em> as part of a plan to be more transparent about the open-world skateboarding game‚Äôs development. <em>Skate</em> has also been playtested by fans in the lead-up to its launch. The new <em>Skate</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 16.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears Activision and Call of Duty‚Äôs teams have listened to the community‚Äôs cries. It‚Äôs been revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won‚Äôt feature a Black Ops 6 carry forward. This would‚Äôve seen cosmetics from BLOPS 6 be available in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-players-think-black-ops-6-purchases-carrying-over-to-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB summary hinted at Black Ops 6 purchases carrying over</a> into Black Ops 7. Despite claims that Call of Duty remains a realistic military shooter, this would‚Äôve meant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>, Squid Game, and various other novelty skins existing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This now appears to be off the cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-won-t-feature-black-ops-6-carry-over-content">Black Ops 7 Won‚Äôt Feature Black Ops 6 Carry-Over Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I mean, what is this? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 26 news briefing on the Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> addressed the ‚ÄúIdentity of Call of Duty.‚Äù It discussed Black Ops 7 being a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. However, the statement also recognized new changes that will be reflected in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>‚ÄúOperators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,‚Äù is the front-page story here. Activision has decided against the planned carry-forward from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The statement continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBlack Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward,&nbsp;because we recognize your time and progression are important. This change applies only to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Call of Duty:&nbsp;Warzone is not affected,&nbsp;and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can‚Äôt help but wonder if this is a response to Battlefield 6. EA and Battlefield Studios have already come out and said: ‚Äú<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 likely won‚Äôt have unrealistic skins &amp; cosmetics</a>. In any case, the negative reaction to Black Ops 7 has more than likely alarmed Activision. We‚Äôll have to see if the company caters to any more feedback moving forward.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you make of this bombshell? Is it the right call? Are we finally seeing the end of wild Call of Duty crossovers? Let me know what you think through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Co-op gaming isn‚Äôt making a comeback; it never left. LEGO Voyagers is the latest title to feature two-player-focused adventuring in a fantastical world you‚Äôre encouraged to explore. I had the opportunity to play it at Gamescom 2025. I also had the pleasure of talking to (and playing the game with) Karsten Lund, who revealed LEGO Voyager‚Äôs potential 5-hour length and other features in a special interview.</p>



<p>Karsten is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a>‚Äòs senior quality manager. He graciously kept me company as we journeyed together through a succinct LEGO Voyagers demo. He had likely played the demo to death when Gamescom 2025 was all said and done. However, I conducted a one-to-one interview all about the LEGO Voyagers demo.</p>



<p>He was more than happy to answer several key questions I had about the game and gave us all a sneak peek at the game‚Äôs motives and content.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-is-something-everyone-s-ready-to-play">LEGO Voyagers is Something ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs Ready to Play‚Äù</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We smashed it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Voyagers</a> doesn‚Äôt focus on a specific media license or property, or a talkative character with a riveting backstory. We care about two mute bricks who want to rescue a spaceship. Lund explained the dynamic and what the team wanted to achieve with Voyagers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThis time around, we focus on the brick; figuring out a way to put brick and brick building as the star of the show as opposed to the minifigure-based games that are also out there. So in this game, you actually play as a LEGO brick, a small one-by-one brick with an eye. Then you have to navigate the levels that are completely brick-built as well.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I did mention recent contemporaries that have excelled in the genre‚Äî<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a>‚Äò work, in particular. Karsten says that ‚Äúthe way has been paved now, right?‚Äù in (presumably) reference to the likes of It Takes Two and Split Fiction. </p>



<p>Furthermore: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something everybody loves to play and everybody‚Äôs ready to play.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Hazelight‚Äôs games, LEGO Voyagers supports the Friends Pass system. This means only <em>one of you</em> needs to buy the game to play it in co-op. Future content hinges on the game‚Äôs success. With it being an easy and accessible co-op LEGO release appealing to a wide demographic, this probably won‚Äôt be an issue.</p>



<p>I also enquired about the game‚Äôs length and if there are any fun mini-games to break up the gameplay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe have a game of tic-tac-toe in the middle of the game, so we‚Äôre giving lots of opportunities to play and hang out in the game. We‚Äôve seen players complete this in four and a half to five hours, if they just run through it and solve the puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I gave my full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers verdict in my complete Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, which I encourage you to check out!</p>



<hr>



<p>LEGO Voyagers is scheduled to release on September 15. Will you be picking it up straightaway? Do we need even more co-op games and fewer multiplayer-only titles?

            <title><![CDATA[Gears of War: Reloaded Review Update]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update.1280982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2006 Gears of War is the classic case of "don't judge a book by its cover;" this seemingly meatheaded, bro-forward game has cemented itself as not only one of the best third-person cover shooter series with its iconic gameplay and weapons, but also one that shrugs at its stereotypes to both embrace them (when was the last time you heard someone called a dickwad?) and defy them with great storytelling and fantastic voice acting. Ten years after its first makeover, it's gotten another with Gears of War: Reloaded. Unlike some games that get a premature remaster treatment a few years after their release, this one looks and feels like a noticeable improvement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we‚Äôve come to expect from Xbox Game Studios developer The Coalition, the PS5 and Steam crowds are welcomed to the first game in this iconic series with gorgeous modern graphics and framerates, and no more waiting around on long load screens. Before we get into the details of Reloaded, here's what IGN said about Gears of War‚Äôs first remaster from 2015: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From playing about seven hours, I can say that the glowing review of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and its few faults still stand true with Reloaded. The story begins by throwing you into the thick of a losing war. Things go from shit to shittier for Marcus Fenix and crew as they try to accomplish one task that spirals out of control, and while that may not be fun for them, it sure is exciting to play, especially with the technical updates. Here are the highlights: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reloaded plays in 4K with up to 120Hz output (if you've got the screen for it). </li><li>The 60fps is a nice upgrade on consoles for the campaign, which previously only went up to 30fps at its launch and 60fps with the Series X performance boost, and 120fps in multiplayer is equally welcome.</li><li>There are more options to change up controls, audio, and more Reloaded than were in Ultimate Edition.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Touch of Color</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 Gears of War: Ultimate Edition did a great job upgrading the notoriously drab look of the Xbox 360 original with color adjustments, lifting the muddy grey and brown fog from the planet Sera. Reloaded takes that a step further, with an even more lively color palette and better lighting that resembles what we saw in Gears 5. The uplifted style gives extra vibrancy to splurting blood during a chainsaw kill, and the blue skies clouded by smoke and dust look nice, too. The Coalition added extra detail to the environment as well, like additional paintings in legal buildings, dense bookshelves, fridges with rotting food, more corpses, and other fitting decor like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Welcome to Delta Squad, PS5 </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still mighty odd seeing Xbox Game Studios on the screen while I hold a DualSense, but I can only say that the shredding of exclusivity lines hasn't hurt Gears of War one bit. If anything, it's made a strong case for me to do a co-op run on PlayStation 5. The core of Reloaded is the same between all three platforms, but the DualSense adds a twist with the adaptive triggers and any comms done through radio output through the controller's speaker. It was a neat surprise having dialogue and sound effects ‚Äì like hitting the perfect active reload ‚Äì presented this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the adaptive triggers can be off-putting in some situations, like when hopping on a Troika where the triggers feel like they're on max resistance for firing the turret or when driving a vehicle, so I could see them being unwelcome to some. I got tired of it in the second act during a long driving section, so I ended up turning adaptive triggers off for a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Gears that's evolved over time is the heavy screen shake with the roadie run. It's less pronounced in other Gears games that‚Äôve come along since, but The Coalition kept the exaggerated effect for Reloaded by default. I appreciate its unique touch and that the shakiness encourages tactical use. Running around an encounter isn't the way to play Reloaded, and if you do, you'll likely be punished for it. Instead, you'll want to run and bounce between cover, keeping yourself protected from the onslaught of enemy fire.  If you don't like screen shake, though, it can be turned off. It's good to have options! </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Some Minor Bugs</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The cool additions are also joined by some minor bugs I‚Äôve seen in the roughly six hours I‚Äôve played on PlayStation 5. There was weirdness in checkpoints jumping me forward and facing a different way, characters‚Äô voices would drop for a line randomly, and I saw some enemies get stuck in between cover. Those bugs have appeared infrequently and weren‚Äôt too bothersome, though, and are probably nothing a patch or two won‚Äôt fix. I didn't see these happen much during my time with the Xbox version, but just because I didn't see them doesn't mean they aren't there. Bugs are tricky like that!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bad Squad AI</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one actively annoying gameplay issues I came across was how incompetent and overall wonky my AI companions were on the Hardcore difficulty level, which is a noticeable downgrade from how they performed in Ultimate Edition. In Reloaded, they go down <em>constantly, </em>whereas in Ultimate Edition they still went down occasionally, but seemed to be helping more<em>.</em> Hardcore is only a step above normal and below Insane, so I expected they should be able to hold their own at least a bit. I noticed Dom waltzing into the dark and dying to the lurking Kryll that shredded him in seconds in one mission, and every now and then, Dom or the other two companions, Cole and Baird, would get stuck far behind, unwilling to leave a doorway. I love Delta squad, but I'm not reviving them every encounter only to put myself in danger.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cherry on Top: Extras for Gears Fans</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: Reloaded includes a nice Extras section, which is something you'd want to see in a remaster like this to reward returning fans who‚Äôre buying it for the second or third time. What'll interest most folks in the Extras section are the five different issues of the Gears of War comic. Grabbing the collectible COG Tags throughout the campaign unlocks pages in five different issues of the Gears of War comic, which is a nice reward for those who haven't read them. This was available in the Ultimate Edition, and it's a welcome return. Completing acts of the campaign also unlocks neat concept art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, while multiple sets of credits may not be what someone who‚Äôs new to this game cares about, for folks like me, seeing the credits available for Reloaded, Ultimate Edition, and the original are in line with Gears' respect for teamwork.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplayer Only Has Minor Tweaks</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer hasn't changed (in terms of what content is included) between Ultimate Edition and Reloaded, though The Coalition upgraded to 60Hz dedicated servers, as opposed to the 30Hz we‚Äôve had in previous versions. The maps got the remaster treatment too, with better lighting, visual effects, and best of all, an upgrade to 120fps on consoles (PC players also get a 240fps option). I expect weapon tuning to be in flux after launch; The Coalition already noted it's making some improvements to the Gnasher, making perfect active reload damage fixed, and more tweaks based on feedback from the beta. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Miranda's Top 10 Games of 2025</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Get Your COG Tags </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If this is your first time playing Gears of War, I recommend finding a friend to join you ‚Äì the Gears of War teams have always designed these games with a partner in mind (and as I mentioned, the AI doesn‚Äôt really pull its weight on the higher difficulty levels). The Coalition thankfully maintained the option to play Reloaded couch co-op, which we don‚Äôt see enough these days, and of course, you've also got the option of online crossplay if your co-op buddy is on another system. I'm still undecided on whether or not I want to spend my next co-op replay on Xbox or PS5 or bounce between them (thanks, cross-progression!), but I'm excited to dive back in again either way.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2021, Marvel Studios attempted to expand the reach of the MCU with an adaptation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">Eternals</a>, a lesser-known group of immortal heroes. Kumail Nanjiani was cast as Kingo alongside Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and more. Eternals didn't earn enough to merit a sequel, and Nanjiani has revealed that he had a deal for a video game and a theme park attraction that never came to pass.</p><p>"I signed on for six movies, you know," said Nanjiani during his appearance on Mike Birbiglia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Y8zwAj3sYpc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working It Out</a> podcast. "I signed on for a video game. I signed on for a theme park ride. They make you sign up for all this stuff ... And so you're like, 'Oh, this is the next 10 years of my life, so I'll be doing Marvel movies every year, and then in-between I'll do like my own little things, whatever I want to do.' And then none of that happened."</p><p>That deal appears to have been predicated on Eternals being a hit like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, which did get licensed out for video games and theme park rides. Marvel hasn't had a lot of video games based directly on the MCU movies in the last two decades, but the studio apparently kept the possibility open for Eternals.</p><p>Nanjiani previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-eternals-star-kumail-nanjiani-went-to-therapy-after-bad-reviews/1100-6520870/" data-ref-id="1100-6520870">disclosed that he went to therapy</a> after Eternals was greeted with bad reviews, but he told Birbiglia that the experience taught him that too much of his self esteem was tied up to other people's reactions to his work.</p><p>Eternals had $402.1 million worldwide, which is a threshold that Marvel Studios has had trouble reaching this year. Regardless, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-brings-adamantium-finally-references-eternals/1100-6525358/" data-ref-id="1100-6525358">the only Marvel movie to pick up on some of the threads introduced in Eternals</a> was Captain America: Brave New World.</p><p>Nanjiani also noted that he's proud of Eternals, and his experience with it has given him material for his latest standup comedy set.</p>
