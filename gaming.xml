            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda’s Latest Update is Awful News for Fallout Fans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-fans-awful-news-bethesda-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda%E2%80%99s-latest-update-is-awful-news-for-fallout-fans.1349554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard revealed that The Elder Scrolls 6 is still ‘a long way off’, despite being revealed almost a decade ago. It’s dire news for fans of The Elder Scrolls, who haven’t received a new ‘numbered release’ since 2011’s Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>



<p>However, in a twist that might displease post-apocalyptic fans, the knock-on impact of this news is that Fallout 5 will be <strong>even further away </strong>than anticipated. The studio’s production line will see The Elder Scrolls 6 on the market before Fallout 5 even enters meaningful development, which is a big issue for fans of the decades-old series.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-5-could-be-ten-years-away">Fallout 5 Could Be Ten Years Away</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GQ around the tenth anniversary of Fallout 4, celebrated by the release of the Anniversary Edition, Todd Howard touched on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-is-still-a-long-way-off/">increasingly long development window</a> of The Elder Scrolls 6. He suggested that the open-world RPG is a long way off and that fans should be ‘patient’.</p>



<p>This presents a tricky issue for Fallout fans.</p>



<p>While Fallout 76 is here and still receiving massive updates, a numbered Fallout release (by that I mean Fallout 5) is likely several years away from being released, if it ever surfaces at all.</p>



<p>We know that the team is working on ‘more Fallout’, but that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">doesn’t necessarily mean Fallout 5</a>. It most likely means <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-begging-bethesda-fallout-3-remastered-game/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a> or a New Vegas project.</p>



<p>It has been known for several years that Bethesda Game Studios’ running order would take them from Starfield to The Elder Scrolls 6 to Fallout 5. Given that we don’t have a <strong>release year </strong>for The Elder Scrolls 6, it could be a while before it hits the market. That means that for as long as it takes to get out the door, Fallout 5 will take even longer to appear.</p>



<p>Presently, we know <strong>nothing </strong>about Fallout 5. There’s not a shred of information to share aside from knowing that Bethesda Game Studios has a core concept for the game.</p>



<p>Bad news, apocalypse fans – you’ve got a while longer to wait.</p>



<p>Are you eagerly awaiting the arrival of Fallout 5? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-and-64-of-them-are-on-steam.1349548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to impress, and the player count is not only holding firm as the game’s lifecycle pushes on – <strong>it’s growing</strong>. The game has gone from strength to strength, and with a roadmap of content sitting on the horizon alongside that positive community sentiment, the game shows no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that the game hit a concurrent user count of 700,000 players over the weekend across all platforms. From the data we’ve collected, we know that a whopping 64% majority of those players were present on Steam.</p>







<p>The extraction shooter genre (however <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-extraction-shooter-dumb/">dumb the name may be</a>) has always been front and centre on PC. From Escape from Tarkov to Marauders, and from Gray Zone Warfare to Arena Breakout: Infinite, the PC platform loves an extraction title.</p>



<p>The latest addition to the lineup is ARC Raiders, released on October 30 and introducing an all-new concept to the genre, a ‘post-apocalyptic’ setting backed by an AI-powered robotic threat.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but the latest figures revealed by Embark Studios paint a particular picture.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Raiders!<br>It's been a little over one week since we opened up the tunnels for you to head Topside, and this past weekend we reached over 700,000 concurrent Raiders on the surface! 🥳<br>We're so happy to have you all here!<br>The many different ways you play and participate in ARC… <a href="https://t.co/Do6bAhWf4o">pic.twitter.com/Do6bAhWf4o</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1987930324156678210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>More than 64% of players are on <strong>Steam</strong>, showing that adoption is perhaps lacking somewhat on PlayStation and Xbox. With a market share of just 36%, console players are showing a lack of investment in the exhilarating extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s a fair statement, as the ‘extraction shooter concept’ is new to console-exclusive gamers. Until now, almost <strong>nothing </strong>with this operating model has appeared on console, save for failed titles like Call of Duty’s DMZ.</p>



<p>If you’re reading this and wondering if you should try ARC Raiders on console but are sceptical about the genre, let me point out that this is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/">highest-rated multiplayer shooter</a> in almost a decade.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to sit high on the charts. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest in the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo 4’s Chinese Version Has Been Censored in a Weird Way]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-china-version-censor-weird-way/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4%E2%80%99s-chinese-version-has-been-censored-in-a-weird-way.1349536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Diablo 4 is all about high-octane combat, impressive visuals, and rivers of hot, red blood. It’s a game tied inexorably to the occult, the underworld, and the afterlife, known for grotesque monsters, visceral sequences, and intense battles that keep the blood and guts flowing.</p>



<p>That’s why it comes as a surprise to some to learn that Diablo 4’s ‘Chinese version’, which was approved for release a few months ago, has been heavily censored, stripping all traces of <strong>blood </strong>from the game and replacing some boss characters’ scarier skins with elements much more tame.</p>



<h2 id="h-diablo-4-toned-down-in-china">Diablo 4 Toned Down in China</h2>



<p>Last year, Microsoft and NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-games-are-officially-returning-to-china/">penned a deal</a> to distribute Blizzard’s games throughout China after leaving the region in 2023. In a drastic move that pushed Blizzard out of China, games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo were rendered unplayable there.</p>



<p>In July, several games were ‘approved’ by China’s National Press and Publication Administration, and one of those games was Diablo 4, the critically acclaimed action RPG title released in 2023.</p>



<p>Now, reports have surfaced that Diablo 4’s Chinese version has been censored, with Blizzard having been forced (assumedly) to remove blood and too much gore from the game. In a post from WOWHead, screenshots were revealed showing a dust-like substance being present in a fight instead of red blood.</p>



<p>Additionally, elements like skulls and bones, common trappings of the underworld, have also been removed. Wandering Death, a boss character made of bones and passed souls, is now made of <strong>rocks</strong>.</p>



<p>No reason has been provided to explain the changes, but it’s assumed that it’s linked to rules against promoting superstition and the supernatural in China. It’s a cultural point, and the regulatory body wants to remove some of the more volatile depictions of death and decay.</p>



<p>Do you think China should slow down on the censorship, or is it not that deep? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-11-884/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-884-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-tuesday-november-11.1349524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Tuesday, and as usual, that means it’s time for another NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s task isn’t an impossible one, but the fastest way possible to solve the NYT Connections challenge for today is to scroll down and use the hints and solutions I’ve assembled for you.</p>



<p>If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections answers and need some back-up, I’m here to help you out. Simply scroll down, pick out the hints, and continue that streak.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #884:</p>



<ul>
<li>MUSIC NOTES</li>



<li>FOUNDATION</li>



<li>STAND</li>



<li>SCALE</li>



<li>BASE</li>



<li>REST</li>



<li>RANGE</li>



<li>COMPASS</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHTER</li>



<li>ENVELOPE</li>



<li>POWDER</li>



<li>SCOPE</li>



<li>SPEECH BUBBLE</li>



<li>BLUSH</li>



<li>EXTENT</li>



<li>HOLDER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Get ready for your close-up… these belong in a beauty bag</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>How wide, how far, how much… these words measure scope</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>They hold things up, keep things steady, or give something a place to rest</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Tap to open… these are visual symbols for apps</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-11-884">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 11 (#884)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLUSH, FOUNDATION, HIGHLIGHTER, POWDER</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – EXTENT, RANGE, SCALE, SCOPE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BASE, HOLDER, REST, STAND</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMPASS, ENVELOPE, MUSIC NOTES, SPEECH BUBBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

It's got grey hairs, now old enough to have a couple of kids, a few different careers, a car in the garage.

If you did, you could play nearly a nearly perfect port of Namco's superb Ridge Racer, try some 3D fighting (a novelty!) in Battle Arena Toshinden, a bit of 3D platforming (woah!) in Jumping Flash!, and 2D sidescrolling platforming in Rayman. The games were perhaps a tad "safe" at the time, but it hinted at big things coming – and within a year, the PlayStation had cemented itself in the Australian gaming landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up my PS1 from a Cash Converters in 1999, then immediately bought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/22/metal-gear-solid-6">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/04/final-fantasy-vii-review">Final Fantasy VII</a>. From there, I delived into a catalogue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/21/xenogears">JRPGs</a>, racing simulators (yeah, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/23/gran-turismo-3">that series</a>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/01/r-type-delta">scrolling shooters</a> and impenetrable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial_(video_game)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dating games</a> as my N64 quietly looked on, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">judging me</a> from the shelf. I'm fairly certain I did not see daylight for about two years – and I knew I wanted to do this stuff as a career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By that point, it was also clear that Sony had a stranglehold over the entire industry – delivering a suite of the finest games month after month that neither Nintendo or SEGA could match for sheer volume. It brought gaming out of the niche basements of the stereotypical gamer and put it smack-bang on the covers of cool magazines. It changed everything.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/536276266-1321476293317591-6086579087571452701-n-1762817912289.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shots fired.

It looked sleek. It looked powerful. In a Kubrickian way, it whispered, <em>"I am a mysterious and untouchable creation that will change the world"</em>. In a very real sense, it did. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation 2 Arrives</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With launch games like Ridge Racer V and Tekken Tag Tournament, it brought the PlayStation brand out of infancy and into the big leagues. Sony's much-vaunted "Emotion Engine" promised state-of-the-art graphical fidelity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/03/ps2-demos-to-die-for">showcased in real-time tech demos</a> that exceeded prerendered cutscenes on the PS1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a breakthrough. Everyone wanted it – a DVD player! A gaming console! In one! And at the time, it was shockingly affordable for a device that could offer both. It propelled DVD sales, gave additional breathing room for developers moving towards larger games (and files). The controller even had analogue face buttons! Can you dig it, baby? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/04/ps2-launch-thousands-clamor-in-the-streets-for-playstation-2">The Japanese launch was an overwhelming success</a>, propelling international hype for the PS2 into the stratosphere.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-10-45-38-am-1762818359583.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iconic and minimalist, the PlayStation 2's blue box proudly displayed on launch day in Akihabara.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN AU started up in 2006 – exactly 10 years after the debut of the PS1 (or PSX as everyone had taken to calling it). In those days, the PS3 had only just debuted in Japan to rapturouos response, thanks to the disruptive adoption of Blu-ray players (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/08/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd">going head-to-head against HD DVD, then cutting off HD DVD's head to become the dominant format of the 2010s)</a> and increasing uptake of 1080p displays. People wanted content to showcase their cool tech. Sony delivered the PS3: an all-in-one Blu-ray player, harddrive-equipped media device and, at the time, beastly gaming device.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS3: Running Up That Hill</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony, it must be said, made it a bit hard for itself around this time. The birth of the meme-era took on the PS3 press reveal, turning "Riiiiiiiidge Racer!", "Giant enemy crab" and "George Foreman grill" into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT920jOJUsY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet phenomenons</a>. That seemed to start a period of iffy consumer sentiment, in part aimed at the USD$499 and USD$599 launch pricing. The Australian launch was still off in the distance, over the horizon, but gamers were braced for a sting in the wallet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/15/au-ps3-first-impressions">first hands-on look at the PS3</a> as a fledgling Australian team of three fine folks: Bennett Ring, Cam Shea, and myself. Sony Australia rolled out a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/20/pause-australian-playstation-event">series of consumer and media events</a> in which to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/27/au-sony-experience-more-event-coverage">showcase its polished ovoid tower</a> and we walked away mostly impressed by the potential of the system. IGN's US team were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/22/ps3-2006-year-in-review">on hand to cover the year's launch titles</a> too. Resistance: Fall of Man was the media darling of the time and, to this day, remembered very fondly. However, it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/09/world-war-iii-ign-aus-next-gen-console-showdown">some teething pains and needed to grow into itself</a>.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4-40-52-pm-1762839656871.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ex-IGN Big Boss Bennett Ring swerves into the Motorstorm turns, while Cam stands there, looking tall.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few years, and a few price cuts and redesigns, the PS3 finally found momentum and delivered on its ambitions. We have the PS3 to thank for Naughty Dog's Uncharted series – a game that, for many, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/uncharted-drakes-fortune-review">came out of the mists and made the console a must-buy</a>. By Uncharted 2, it was clear that Nathan Drake was a star for the ages, and Naughty Dog was just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without doubt, the system's<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review"> pinnacle achievement was The Last of Us</a>. It was a technical showcase for the ageing hardware and a cinematic and gameplay line in the sand for developers. At risk of turning this into a love letter to Naughty Dog, Sony truly understood that this studio propelled its hardware forward – and gamers responded to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, Sony also went on a Wii-inspired foray into motion-based gaming with the PlayStation Move controller and camera. It was successful enough to spawn a whole series of Move-enabled titles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">PlayStation <em>Phwoar</em>!</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping 12 whole years ago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/20/playstation-4-revealed">the PlayStation 4 was revealed in fine fashion</a>. Cam and Luke waxed lyrical about it in the video above. It seemed then, as it does now, a return to form for Sony's PlayStation brand. It came out of the gates strong and player focussed. The "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkMdi3XBhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the Players</a>" campaign underscored a renewed focus on the core player experience. Wisely so, particularly with Nintendo's Switch just around the corner and an industry that was never bigger and more flush with great games and hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there were new experiences to be had – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/14/a-closer-look-at-the-playstation-4-controller-prototype">and a new controller design</a> (the first major rethink of the iconic PlayStation controller in the system's history) was coming. Naughty Dog released another breakthrough title, The Last of Us 2. The power of the PS4 also enabled Sony to experiment with another emerging field: VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, the PSVR headset. For the time and not <em>un</em>substantial money, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review">PSVR offered impressive VR fidelity combined with great games</a> and IPs that other competing hardware could only look on enviously. When juiced up with the PS4 Pro (a new mid-generation hardware refresh), it improved performance even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While VR may have had its moment in the sun, and it now feels like the technology is mostly hibernating until the next big thing comes along, it pointed towards more TV-free gaming experiences that have become more and more normalised.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 and Beyond</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-5/PlayStation_5_Release_Date,_Pricing,_and_Launch_Games">Enter: The PS5</a>. PlayStation 5 – the current generation of Sony consoles, in standard and Pro models. By 2020, digital marketplaces were standard and the TV screen was just one way of interacting with your PlayStation. The PS5 ushered in PSVR 2, a souped up version of the PSVR we know and love. Plus, it brought to the table a Switch-like (but not quite) handheld solution: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">The PlayStation Portal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've noticed, we haven't discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">Sony's PSP</a> (in gloriously piano black, a luxurious widescreen handheld in 2004) or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/13/sony-playstation-vita-review">PS Vita</a> – pseudo PS3 in your pocket. But all of those handheld experiences seem to have been teasing where Sony (and Nintendo, for that matter) are heading. Already rumours are swirling about the <em>PlayStation 6</em> and oh boy do I feel old now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here's to you, Sony PlayStation. You are 30 years young in Australia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a very different world and games industry today than the one that I and many others remember from the turn of the millenium. However, the PlayStation has been an island of stability, joy, and adventure throughout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we all be playing our PS10s in 2055? Jacked straight into our neural cortex like a back alley goon from Neuromancer? Will TVs still exist? What about game stores? One thing is true: PlayStation fans will always adore this brand – so in a sense, the future is up to you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/special/playstation-30th-birthday-giveaway-au?">Aussies: Win a PlayStation®5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle!</a></h3></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-au-retrospective-playstation-turns-30-in-australia]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has revealed that the PlayStation 5 has sold over 84 million units worldwide since its launch in 2020. Furthermore, the console doesn’t seem to be stopping, selling over 3.9 million in the past three months.</p>



<p>Despite a high price tag, the PlayStation 5 has gone on to be a highly successful console compared to others on the market. With landmark first-party titles like Ghost of Yotei, God of War: Ragnarok, and Astro Bot, there’s a lot to love about Sony’s latest gaming product. Earlier this year, the console was said to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-has-sold-over-75-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 75 million units</a>, which is a pretty impressive number. Now, it’s gone up almost 10 million, with a good bit of those sales done just recently.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a financial report from PlayStation</a>, <strong>the PlayStation 5 has sold 84.2 million units worldwide</strong>. Over the past three months, it’s sold 3.9 million, a 0.1% increase from last fiscal year. For comparison, the Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/microsoft-xbox-one-discontinue/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold around 84 million</a> and the Xbox One sold 53 million (<a href="https://gamingbolt.com/xbox-series-x-s-has-sold-21-million-units-xbox-one-at-58-million-as-per-microsoft-brazil-presentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last reported in 2023</a>) over their lifetimes. It’s a pretty impressive feat, especially since the console is still on the market for $500. Unfortunately, it’s unknown if PlayStation 5 Pro is included or what it has sold.</p>



<p>Other interesting stats from the report include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-final-launch-trailer-playstation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s sales, which <strong>total 3.3 million copies</strong> since its launch in October. Furthermore, it seems <strong>a majority of gamers bought digital</strong> in Q2 of 2025, just around 72%. In terms of PlayStation Online, over 119 million monthly users are on. Overall, it seems like Sony is happy with how the PlayStation 5 is shaping out. With many exciting game still to come, like Saros, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>, and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, it’ll likely be an uphill slide from here. </p>

<p>This award recognises industry icons and organisations that have exhibited a "significant, sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation".

<p>Reggie has even shared an official comment about Pokémon's success over the years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Pokémon Company is without peer, responsible for creating a massive juggernaut of a franchise that has become a landmark title in gaming’s storied history. I saw firsthand the love and care that went into each Pokémon game I was part of, and how much each new game resonated deeply with the fans. Now, to be there for Pokémon, when it’s being recognized as this year’s winner of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award, it’s a full circle moment that I am ecstatic to be a part of!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in the same PR, Pokémon originally broke through in the "mid-to-late 90s", and most recently achieved "$12 billion global retail sales in 2024, including over 489 million game copies sold since 1996".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pokémon is considered one of the world’s highest-grossing media franchises. Its legend only grows stronger as new generations are drawn to new video games, animated series, movies, The Pokémon Trading Card game, mobile apps and more from The Pokémon Company."</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo yesterday <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">launched a new search page</a>, allowing users to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Switch 2. This includes the ability to look up individual games and apps, instead of having to wait for Nintendo to update entire pages and official documents.</p>
<p>It's got us wondering how you're finding Switch compatibility on the new hybrid device now that we're six months into the system's life. Admittedly, there are still some issues - with games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR: Automata</a> and video apps like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/youtube">YouTube</a> still not supported. Of course, Nintendo previously noted how not every Switch game would be supported on release, but there have been game updates since then.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067khszuy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anno 117: Pax Romana Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-review.1349419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the sun rises on the cobbled market street that ascends from bustling docks on the vibrant Mediterranean waters to the new forum high on the hill above, Anno 117: Pax Romana fills me with delight and civic pride. It took a long time, but I feel like I finally clicked with this series that I've had a little bit of a rocky relationship with, having come in a bit late and at an awkward time with 2205. Its complex economics can still seem to wobble spectacularly off their axis and leave you in a dire failure spiral, but resplendent mechanics for trade, naval warfare, and the blending of cultures offer chances to right the ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The basic routine in Anno 117 is familiar and effective if you've played other games in the series. You start out building modest residences to house hardworking <em>liberti, </em>or freed people<em> </em>– somewhat conspicuously sidestepping the institution of Roman slavery. When their needs are met, they can promote up the social ladder all the way to snobby patricians who demand all kinds of exotic delicacies from around the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of what influences these promotions is simply access to goods, which is a city-wide thing. But another component is living near high prestige buildings like theaters and shrines… and far away from unpleasant or polluting ones like a charcoal burner. I love the way this naturally creates clusters of higher-class housing on important market streets, tapering off into working class neighborhoods in more industrial areas. It adds to the feel of a real, living city. And since paved roads extend the range of those buildings, that's an upgrade that lets you immediately see its positive effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's genuinely delightful to zoom in and watch my little toga-clad citizens going about their business. Every building from a stately villa to an idyllic lavender farm is studded with detail and character. Even the untouched green fields and peaceful blue waters full of marine life create a strong sense of place. The character models for leaders and advisors may be the one thing that didn't wow me. They're full of character, but especially in some of the campaign cutscenes, there were some significant lip sync issues that made it look like a much older game or a badly-dubbed movie.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Anno 117 really comes alive with its detailed trade system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The summery paradise of Latium isn't the only locale to explore and exploit. Eventually you unlock the ability to sail to foggy, rocky Albion – that is, Britain – with its own resources, aesthetic, and population. I was a bit worried Anno would lean too hard into othering stereotypes about "mystical Celts" here based on some of the marketing, but it's actually a pretty grounded and sensible depiction. The really interesting choice you have mechanically in this region is whether to stay true to Celtic traditions or fully Romanize your new subjects. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and you can eventually mix and match for some powerful synergies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anno 117 really comes alive with its detailed trade system, though. To truly meet the needs of demanding nobles in the two regions, you'll have to set up production chains for luxury goods that might pull resources from two or three different islands, then ship them across the world map from one region to another. Each delivery requires individual ships assigned to the trade routes, so I can see exactly where my next delivery of cheese is and even reroute it somewhere else.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all fairly easy to set up and tweak thanks to the well-organized interface, and naturally creates incentives to build smaller villages that do one specific thing as well as warehouses and waystations to speed things up. My cheese island is quite far away, so I noticed my trade ships spent half their time sailing across Albion. But if I set up a colony close to it that's basically just a cheese warehouse and some subsistence fisheries, I can constantly be moving cheese there with intra-region trade ships to be picked up at the edge of the map all at once. I adore this kind of logistics stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anno 117 is a pretty good RTS, too. I'm especially a fan of its naval combat, which I had to master quickly to protect my trade routes from increasingly vicious pirates. Maneuvering ships feels weighty and realistic, with differences in maneuverability based on whether they rely on sails, oars, or both, and I eventually got pretty good at maneuvers like trapping a sneaky little pirate ship in a cove where there would be no escape.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a pretty good RTS, too, and I'm especially a fan of its naval combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ground combat is just fine. It does its job, with a small selection of melee, ranged, and siege units that can fulfill a handful of different roles. It's possible to succeed without ever getting into a land battle if you have a good navy, but in the few cases where I did, I found some interesting tactics to dig into. It feels like a real RTS at least, as opposed to a half-baked minigame, which I really appreciate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diplomacy is pretty basic stuff, with a single interesting wrinkle in that the Emperor works a bit differently. You can't really make treaties with him, but he will make demands of you, and succeeding, failing, or refusing affects your reputation with Rome. When he likes you, you get bonuses. When he doesn't, you get penalties. But both ends of the scale culminate in some very powerful rewards. Either you play nice and get appointed Consul, or you defy his authority so effectively that you grant yourself Proconsular authority, Caesar-style.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 City Builders</h3><p>I just reviewed Cities: Skylines 2, so let's take a look back and rank the best city builders over the ages.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a decent story campaign, but it's really more of an extended tutorial. It took me less than 10 hours to finish and only really scratches the surface of the mechanics you can play with in endless mode. You can play as either Marcus or Marcia, with the latter being a sort of madcap "Weekend at Bernicus’" scenario where you are taking on the governor duties of your totally-not-dead husband. It's hardly Shakespeare, but there's some interesting intrigue going on and a cast of memorable characters. The Canaanite Ben-Baalion was a particularly endearing companion who presented me with an emotionally satisfying choice at the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can continue from the ending of the campaign as long as you want, most of my playtime was spent in the endless mode, which lets you start in either Albion or Latium and offers a wide range of difficulty options. You can even pick from a set of rival governors with different personalities and playstyles. I don't think they necessarily play by the same rules that you do as a player, however. Looking at some late game cities they built… I honestly don't know what's going on. But they can be compelling adversaries or valuable trade partners nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still some classic Anno issues kicking around, like the fact that very large economies can become unwieldy and are prone to death spirals. If food is disrupted, population drops, which causes food buildings to become underemployed, leading to even less food and even more population drop. At one point I had to restart because I accidentally changed a large city's patron god, which made it instantly insolvent and nearly irrecoverable due to lost agricultural bonuses. But trade is kind of the hero here once again, since setting up buy orders for whatever you're out of can bail you out of a lot of tricky spots as long as you have cash. It's a little fiddly setting up a lot of different trades at a lot of different harbors the first time, but the interface is easy to work with, and once things were set, I didn't find I had to mess with them very often.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops typically force compromises on storage, RAM, or processor power to hit accessible price points, and leave buyers frustrated with sluggish performance. Dell quietly sidesteps this problem by offloading fully-loaded Inspiron 15-inch laptops through Amazon rather than advertising aggressive discounts on its own website to protect brand perception while clearing inventory.</p>
<p>The Inspiron 3530 with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5432/">Intel i7 processor, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD currently sells for just $939 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $3,599 price tag</a>. Dell’s own site shows no comparable promotion which makes <strong>Amazon the exclusive channel for this 74% discount</strong> that brings professional-grade specs down to consumer pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5432/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Dell Loaded This Laptop With Premium Components</h2>
<p>Fantastic performance without the thermal throttling that makes cheaper laptops struggle with demanding workflows comes <strong>with the 13th generation Intel Core i7-1355U processor</strong>. This 10-core chip with 12MB cache revs up as high as 5.0 GHz when needed for responsive computing. Moreover, the integrated graphics in the Intel Iris Xe really push beyond what most mainstream integrated options can provide: This means you’re getting a laptop that will not become obsolete the moment you need to do something more resource-intensive than just basic web browsing and document editing.</p>



<p>Adding 32GB of DDR4 RAM to this machine takes it from merely adequate to truly capable for professional work. Such ample memory allows seamless multitasking among creative applications so you could edit photos in one window, render video in another and monitor your email in a third. For anyone who works with virtual machines, large datasets or memory-intensive development environments, the extra 32GB gives you the headroom that spares you constant application switching and waiting.</p>



<p>This 1TB SSD gives plenty of storage for operating system and personal files without imposing constant cleaning or cloud dependence. Solid-state storage delivers boot times measured in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch almost instantaneously compared to mechanical hard drives. A PCIe connection provides the drive with the bandwidth needed to operate at maximum speed, meaning large files transfer quickly and the whole system feels responsive.</p>
<p>The anti-glare coating on this 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen provides excellent visual quality that, during extended work sessions and increases comfort. A 1920×1080 resolution enables one to have sharp rendering of text, which reduces eye strain when working with documents. WVA panel technology assures the viewer of accurate color representation and wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>The options include older legacy USB 2.0 ports for older peripherals, modern USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C ports to enable fast data transfer, HDMI 1.4 for external displays, an SD card reader in service of photographers, and a standard headphone jack. WiFi 6 support provides the fastest wireless connectivity currently available, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures reliable connections to wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro includes</strong> additional security features and the ability to join a domain that’s not offered in the home versions, while the<strong> Copilot AI assistant</strong> offers contextual help to make productivity tasks easier.</p>
<p>For $939, this laptop is cheaper than many mid-range machines with half the RAM and storage: <strong>it’s a spectacular value that Dell can’t promote too loudly without undermining its premium brand position</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p><em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> was one of my absolute favourite games of 2024. I've said a lot of nice things about its <a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review/" rel="noreferrer">sandbox design</a>, its writing, the music, the scope, but today I want to talk about one thing in particular, because that's what this feature is about: its art.</p><p>With a relatively limited budget and small team, some smart art design decisions and faultless inspiration means I remember <em>Sandwitch </em>as fondly for its looks as I do games with 100x the budget. It had such a <em>breezy </em>vibe, one that was perfectly in keeping with the game's familial tone and seaside setting. </p><p>Because I loved it so much, and because I haven't run one of these posts for a while, I figured there was no better subject for a Showcase blog than Charles Boury, who served as Art Director on the project.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey Charles, thanks for chatting with us! What was your experience working on the game? Did you think it would resonate with a global audience the way it has?</strong></p><p><strong>Charles Boury</strong>: I was very much involved since early production to final release, for nearly three years. It’s the longest I’ve worked on a game. I was grateful of the absolute trust the team gave me for setting an art style and developing a world. Giving life to the story and the world of Cigalo was awesome. Every game dev story has highs and lows, and we had big lows for sure. I had moments of desperate doubts. It was hard. But we hanged on. For me, the early pitch was so important that I think it was worth it.</p><p>We aimed to create something more gentle and diverse, you know, that’s why it resonated strongly with players around the world. Everyone in the team wanted to deviate from the common open world, where you slash, extract and conquer. We were tired of seeing humans portrayed as inherently bad, and nature as a resource. We wanted to be optimistic for the future, spark an aspiration to live in communities, and deal with conflicts without violence.</p><figure></figure><p>As an art director, my role was to transcribe these intentions in visuals. But I think my most useful contribution to this project was to come up with a way to create a small open-world with a tiny team of 3 artists, with an easy-to-scale style that is still appealing.</p><p>But to be frank, I didn’t expected the game to go so well. It may be because of the queerness of its cast and plot, filling a need of representation, or the proud political stances our Creative Director Emi took on socials. Few games and studios are promoting diversity and anti-capitalism. But is this the only reason why people are drawn to this game? I believe its joyful visuals and soothing gameplay create the initial spark. Why the trailer did so well? Is it the vivid but smooth color palette, or the Mediterranean vibe? Or is it the yellow van? I really don’t know, but I think it’s a coherent artistic statement.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p><br><strong>LP: I mentioned what I <em>thought </em>were some of the game's visual inspirations in my piece about <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>, especially <em>Wind Waker</em>, but what were some of the <em>actual </em>influences for your work on the game?</strong></p><p><strong>CB: </strong><em>Nausicaa</em> was a big inspiration, visually and politically. The other main influence is the illustrative work of Simon Stålenhag. Then there are more specific refs, like the character eyes of <em>The Wind Waker</em>, the dunes of <em>Journey</em>, the music of <em>Sable</em>, and many more.</p><p>Formally, the visual of our game lean slightly on a “Ghibli aesthetic”: characters with big eyes, solid, vibrant colors, and recurring tropes like a young female as a protagonist. But we tried to be more faithful of our inspirations than a simple formal resemblance. We aimed to give a playable experience true to the values we loved in Ghibli movies. So: everyday-life, pastoral aesthetics, humane issues, the trope of a trusty vehicle (the glider of <em>Nausicaa</em>, the plane of <em>Porco Rosso</em>, Kiki’s broom…). Also, we are aware of what games are: trendy, mass-media leisure hobbies delivering power fantasies to rich people. It doesn’t align with the values portrayed by the story. But like Ghibli studio, we decided to use a seductive media to deliver our message to a wide audience, make an exploration open-world game while pulling away from its usual shortcomings.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p><strong>LP: I saw on your site you mention techwear as an influence in some of the game's costume designs. [Willem Dafoe voice] As something of a </strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>techwear</strong></a><strong> guy myself, were there any brands or pieces you drew on specifically for the characters?<p>CB: </p></strong>I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I don’t know any techwear brand! I didn’t do acute researches and only skimmed the net for a few cool refs, without knowing any specifics about the trend. So a simple combination of high waist pants, straps, a bomber jacket and a waist bag. I hope I didn’t miss the spirit of techwear while designing the protagonist's clothes.</p><p>This style was chosen as a way to hint at her ability to parkour, and reveal the dichotomy between her situation, coming from an urban and high-tech environment, and the other characters, living in a lonely village.</p><figure></figure><hr><p>If you want to see more of Charles' stuff, you can check out more of his art (and comments on projects he's worked on) <a href="https://charlesboury.fr/?ref=aftermath.site">at his personal site</a>.</p><div data-layout="immersive">

            <p>
I hope none of you are allergic to shellfish, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shrimp-game">Shrimp Game</a> is exactly what it sounds like: a game about shrimp! And yet that is a complete bastardisation of what it is, for you do not simply play as a shrimp, you are piloting a shrimp, or SHRIMP (Submersible Hydrodynamic Research Integrated Marine Platforms), and you must survive a hellish underwater landscape filled with sea creatures that strive to see your life ended and "Lovecraftian bosses."
</p>
<p>
There is a hint of games like Armored Core to be found here, more so in movement mechanics. You don't pick out parts for your shrimp, but you do pilot it as if it were a mech, zooming around the seascape, shooting at other fishes and the like with your abilities. These abilities are based on elements like fire and earth, or light and dark, and you can even mix and match them to a certain degree. You will also find, amazingly, that you can play the game's campaign in six-player co-op, or you can try out its PvP modes like "Shrimp Royale, Shrimp Tag, and Capture the Turtle!"
</p>
<p>
Shrimp Game currently has a demo on Steam that I spent a bit of time with after spotting it in The Virtual Moose's most recent <a href="https://virtualmoose.org/2025/11/08/indie-game-roundup-november-8-2025/">indie game round-up</a> - just in the campaign mode, though its online mode is available too - and it is as frenetic as it is wacky. Enemy attacks approach you at all angles, you need to be constantly aware of your surroundings otherwise you'll end up sleeping with the fishes, literally and figuratively.
</p>
<p>
Its world is tantalizingly weird and mysterious too, as silly as it might be to feel this way about something called Shrimp Game, I really vibed with its salty hellscape. I want to learn about why this world exists in the way it does. I want to understand why I have to pilot the shrimp.
</p>
<p>
When can I do this? Well, sometime in 2026, as it doesn't have a more specific release date beyond that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824880/SHRIMP_GAME/">wishlist the game on Steam</a> (and try out the demo) right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a lot of work and years of waiting, Blizzard’s massively popular loot-filled action RPG <em>Diablo 4</em> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/blizzard-brings-diablo-4-to-china-in-december-after-long-awaited-approval-379129">is&nbsp; officially making its way to China next month</a>. But, due to various regulations in the country regarding the depiction of corpses and supernatural elements, blood and other elements like a big ol’ skeleton boss won’t be featured in the localized version of <em>Diablo 4.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4-license-approved-by-chinese-government-377853">In July,</a> <em>Diablo 4</em> was one of the few foreign games officially approved by China’s National Press and Publication Administration for launch in the country. Since then, players have wondered what changes would be made to the game, which features a lot of skeletons, dead bodies, zombies, and gore. Now, via a free early trial available to players who pre-registered to play <em>Diablo 4</em>, we have our first look at some of the changes Blizzard has made to get the game published in China.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-chinese-servers-will-have-some-cosmetic-differences-for-players-379189">As reported by <em>WOWHead</em> on November 10</a>, one of the biggest and most noticeable changes is that in China, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_censorship_in_China"><em>Diablo IV</em>&nbsp;doesn’t feature any blood</a>. Instead, blood is replaced with a brown, transparent dust-like effect. In a game where nearly every action against NPCs results in blood splatter or even full-on explosions of sticky red goo, this is a very noticeable difference, especially when fighting large groups of enemies who normally pop like overfilled water balloons when smacked around with a sword.</p>

 <p>Another big change spotted by the outlet is that at least one boss has been changed. In the original version o<em>f Diablo 4</em>, one of the game’s bosses is Wandering Death, a large, ghostly skeleton who players team up to take down. In China, this<em> Diablo 4</em> world boss has been turned into a giant made out of rocks and boulders. While <em>WOWHead</em> wasn’t able to confirm how other skeletons look, it’s believed that, due to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/21/chinas-new-gaming-rules-to-ban-poker-blood-and-imperial-schemes/">China’s strict regulations against depictions of dead bodies and occult-like imagery</a>, other skeleton enemies in the ARPG will likely not look the same. Even some icons in <em>Diablo 4</em> had to be changed to remove skulls.</p> <p>Of course, these changes will let <em>Diablo 4</em> launch in China on December 12, over two years after it launched in the rest of the world. I imagine that, for players who have been patiently waiting to play<em> Diablo 4</em> in China, these changes won’t ruin the fun of killing four million enemies and picking up 400 swords.</p>

                <p>Late last month, the superhero work comedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a> was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.</p><p>Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqU5hSVA78" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Friends Per Second</a> podcast (Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.</p><p>"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now," said Shorette. "That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have."</p><p>Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">a video game project in the works with Critical Role</a>, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI2S4LITn8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EI2S4LITn8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with over 131,000 concurrent players</a>. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.</p>

<p>On <strong>Wednesday, 12th November 2025</strong> at <strong>6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm GMT</strong>, Nintendo will be debuting the first proper trailer to the sequel to Nintendo and Illumination's 2023 box office smash, <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>A YouTube premiere has already been set up, and you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6ePBMZWeCo">watch it right here</a>.</p>

<p>We've had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1mTbYB6EOM">one brief teaser</a> of the movie during September's Nintendo Direct, which confirmed the film's official title. But other than that, we know little else other than it will be arriving in cinemas on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, earlier today, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a certain character design</a> may have leaked for a second time.

			<p>Shortly after a new look at Yoshi and the reveal of Bowser Jr. in the film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">leaked by an image of a Pillsbury Cookie Dough box</a>, Nintendo announced that it will host a Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the Super Mario Galaxy Movie this coming Wednesday, November 12, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">announced on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and in the Nintendo Today! app. The post on X (formerly Twitter) clarifies that there will be no video game-related news, so don't expect anything game-related. This Direct is specifically focused on the film, and that's it.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>The news of this Direct isn't exactly surprising, considering that just last week, a report (that we now know was at least partially correct) <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">claimed that the first proper trailer for the film would be shown online soon</a>, since it would also be shown at upcoming screenings of Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part-two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>We'll almost definitely see the first proper trailer for the film on Wednesday, and, if this Direct will be anything like the Direct event Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-movie-first-trailer-chris-pratt-voice/">did for the Super Mario Bros Movie</a>, we'll also likely find out the rest of the cast (save for those who are returning) and discover a little more about the film's plot.</p>



<p>The first Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive hit at the box office, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">making over $500 million in its first week</a>, and eventually eclipsing $1.3 billion globally. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">sequel was confirmed soon after</a>, which, if it keeps its current April 3, 2026 premiere date, will arrive almost three years to the date from when the first film premiered.</p>

<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie came out in 2022 to massive success.

A sequel, now titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, was quickly greenlit, and a short teaser was released during the last Nintendo Direct. While leaks have been rampant and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a trailer</a> abundant, it seems Nintendo is ready to show it off, and soon.</p>

<p>Announced by <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintend</a>o, <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct will livestream at 6 am PT/9 am EST on November 12th, 2025</strong>. It will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, and the Nintendo Today! app. The presentation plans to talk about the upcoming film and show off the first official trailer. The tweet does note that no new game information will be revealed at the event, so don’t expect any 3D Mario news. Still, we could get some casting and character reveals for the film, slated to release on April 3rd, 2025.</p>



<p>A bit ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-bowser-jr-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a leak</a> regarding who may be in the film came from Pillsbury slice-and-bake cookies. The box showed off Yoshi, who was teased at the end of the first film. His design, more realistic than his game counterpart, looked quite good. On the back, we did see Bowser Jr.’s logo, hinting that the son of Bowser is making his debut in the film. Seeing how popular The Super Mario Bros. Movie was, the new trailer for Galaxy is sure to be a hit for fans and moviegoers alike.</p>

            <p>
Do you think there are people out there that feel as passionately as sports fans do when someone gets added to their team that might make them better, but with video game developers? Probably not, or at least only on a personal level, but for that hypothetical group of people that exists, a new trade (is that how you refer to sports doers, I really don't know) has taken place between the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, and CD Projekt Red.
</p>
<p>
Karel Kolmann announced on his personal Bwitter account earlier today that "<a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342">Things are happening!</a>" those things being that he now works for CD Projekt Red as a senior quest designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-loss-is-the-witcher-4s-gain-as-cd-projekt-red-picks-up-the-lead-gameplay-designer-behind-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-action-rpg/">GamesRadar</a>). While I can't tell you the exact missions Kolmann worked on in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a handy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkolmann/overlay/1738234374263/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAA-hQ1MBs2pvuw9SYLFGUiET729k6q5A4Fw">LinkedIn post</a> tells us that he designed and wrote 11 of them, and also designed the game's crime system alongside the stealth and perception systems of NPCs.
</p>
<p>
A clue into the kind of work he might be doing on The Witcher 4? Literally no way of knowing! But he does have some specific skills, so Ciri getting up to some stealthy stuff feels possible at least.
</p>
<p>
As it currently stands, we… don't actually know all that much about The Witcher 4. Here's some things we do know: it's "more console-first" though it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-console-first-development-still-push-pcs">still be able to melt your PC</a>, it'll be made in Unreal Engine 5 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">even got a fancy tech demo</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't be out before 2027</a>, and will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">apparently explore sexism more directly</a> with Ciri at the helm. Considering it only properly started development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">at the end of last year</a>, we're probably a ways out from getting any kind of gameplay trailer. I'm sure you can just play The Witcher 4 for the umpteenth time while you wait.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-game-tests-if-people-know-how-much-porn-characters-have-on-the-internet-and-they%E2%80%99re-failing.1349320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know what they say: “Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it.” This internet rule posits that every fictional character has lewd art of them somewhere online, and there’s a website called Rule 34 that curates it and lets you search by character. But are you internet poisoned enough to be able to guess which characters have the most entries on that site? I thought I was, but I was very wrong.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.rule34dle.org/"><span>Rule34dle</span></a><span> is a browser game that pits two characters or franchises against one another and asks you to guess which of the pair has been the subject of more smutty art on the internet. I figured this would be easy. I know who the sickos are on the internet, and I also know which fandoms have the most artistically inclined community members. Or so I thought. But even after being a fan for nearly 30 years and writing about the series almost every day here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, I underestimated the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-official-forums-moderation-ban-rules-nintendo-1850605719"><span>depravity of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fandom</span></a><span>. What do you mean Snivy, the sassy little snake guy from </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>,</span> <span>has more entries than Kitana from </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>In just a few minutes of guessing, I was repeatedly taken aback by the gaps between some characters. Sometimes they were as wide as the ocean, and at other times they were too close for comfort. Leavanny from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>being just a couple of hundred entries away from the frost giant heartthrob Loki? That didn’t sound right, so I went investigating, and lo and behold, it was true. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The surprising answers do make Rule34dle a really fun game to play with friends or on stream. I’ve started seeing streamers play the game, and they’re also shocked at some of the results, so maybe some of us have just never quite peered into the abyss long enough.</span></p>         <p><span>If you want to try it out, none of the NSFW stuff is shown in the game itself, so you’re safe on that front. You can also try </span><a href="https://ao3dle.org/"><span>AO3dle</span></a><span>, which is the same concept but specifically pulling from fanfiction site Archive of Our Own. That one at least offers some plausible deniability because not everything on there is porn.</span></p>
