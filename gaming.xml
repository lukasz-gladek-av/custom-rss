		<p>Garcia Hotspur will be fighting Hell itself once again when Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered releases on October 31st. The release date trailer is a bit insane so mentally prepare yourself before clicking on play. It confirms that Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered will have new costumes for Garcia Hotspur, and a New Game+ mode, which was not present in the original 2011 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwpT42plQiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story follows demon hunter Garcia Hotspur who comes home to find that the Lord of Demons has kidnapped his girlfriend, and will kill her over and over in the underworld. Garcia cannot stop him initially, but he descends to the underworld with his demon ally Johnson. Johnson is also Garcia’s main weapon taking on the shape of a gun, as well as taking the form of a torch and motorcycle too. The game does have some environmental puzzles to complete too, which Garcia navigates by using light bullets to push back the darkness. The darkness is pockets of the underworld that would damage Garcia, taking his health and eventually killing him if he stays in those areas for too long.</p>

<p>In our original 2011 review for Shadows of the Damned, nofi wrote,<em>“Shadows Of The Damned provides eight hours or so of some of the best third person shooting we’ve seen for ages – it’s well produced, expertly paced and deliciously funny.&nbsp; It’s not scary, by any stretch, but it doesn’t need or want to be – this isn’t played for scares, more for cheap shock and fun, and it manages that perfectly.&nbsp; Sure, it’s not for everyone and once it’s done it’s done (there’s no New Game +) but if you’re looking for something to blast through this weekend this might just be your tonic.”</em></p>

<p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and it is available to pre-order on all platforms for £19.99.</p>

This new project is different from their ongoing actual play or the original programming on their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beacon</a> streaming service. They and Third Person are working on <em>Moonward: A Midst Roleplaying Journey</em>, a brand new experimental miniseries.</p>
<h2>The Moonward: A Midst Roleplaying Journey Announcement</h2>
<p><em>oonward: A Midst Roleplaying Journey</em> is a four-part experimental series. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/metapideon-and-critical-role-purchase-semi-improvised-audio-drama-series-midst" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Midst</em> series</a>, it is a blend of audio drama, live music, multimedia, and semi-improvised theatre, all in service of creating an immersive experience. The miniseries is accessible to both newcomers and Midst fans alike.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonward-third-person-trio-profile-image.jpg?itok=loCD_ts- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonward-third-person-trio-profile-image.jpg?itok=hFN-SIGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Critical Role founders Marisha Ray and Liam O'Brien will join the Third Person performance group for this miniseries. <em>Moonward</em> is a standalone story in the <em>Midst</em> cosmos. It will follow an expedition to uncover the remnants of Midst's destroyed moon.</p>
<p>It must be noted that <em>Moonward</em> marks the first time the Third Person performers have made their names public. Both Ray and O'Brien will be join Sara Wile and Matt Roen as players, and the experience will be guided by Xen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Midst itself was born from Third Person's shared love of tabletop gaming,” stated Xen. “We're thrilled, over the moon, you might even say, to return to our gaming origins with Moonward and tell a new Midst story in one of our most favorite formats."</p>
<p>“Midst has always been about play and experimentation,” said Wile. “We're honored to have this opportunity to adapt our storytelling style into a new medium with Critical Role, and we hope people will find it as fun to watch as we did to create!"</p>
<p>“The <em>Midst</em> cosmos was built using roleplay and improvisation to craft a collaborative narrative sandbox: Storytelling with friends,” added Roen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first episode of <em>Moonward</em> will debut on August 7 at 7 PM PDT on Critical Role's Twitch and YouTube channels, Midst's YouTube channel, and in podcast format via Spotify and Apple Podcasts. New episodes will debut on Wednesdays. Beacon members will have access to the first two episodes on August 7 and future episodes two weeks in advance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/24/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warner Bros. Games has acquired Player First Games, the developer of its cross-over platform fighter MultiVersus. The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240722944100/en/Warner-Bros.-Games-Acquires-Player-First-Games">press release</a>, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2022/05/30/an-interview-with-multiversus-director-tony-huynh">Tony Huynh</a> and Chris White.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The announcement comes&nbsp;<span>only a couple of months after MultiVersus'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/11/multiversus-is-back-in-action-this-may" target="_blank">relaunch</a>&nbsp;on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance</span>&nbsp;to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-mobile-game-to-shut-down-a-year-after-launch-as-developer-netherrealm-suffers-layoffs">shuttered the entire mobile division</a> of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”</p>

<p>“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”</p>

<p>MultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/multiversus/packing-a-punch">here</a>), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/check-out-the-jokers-multiversus-gameplay-and-the-batman-who-laughs-alternate-costume">The Joker</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/20/multiversus-launch-trailer-reveals-jason-voorhees-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith">Agent Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/jason-voorhees-gets-a-dedicated-multiversus-trailer">Jason Voorhees</a>, and the recently announced <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/22/samurai-jack-and-beetlejuice-are-headed-to-multiversus">Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator has just announced the arrival of World Update XVII, with the game returning to the United Kingdom and Ireland to expand these regions with new points of interest (POI), challenges, exploration flights and more. Learn more details about Microsoft Flight Simulator’s biggest world update below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Microsoft Flight Simulator World Update XVII: United Kingdom &amp; Ireland is now available as a free update. Players on Xbox Series X/S, PC, Game Pass and Cloud Gaming can now explore the new content.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="World Update XVII: United Kingdom &amp; Ireland Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xGlXW3-xYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new MFS World Update will include new POIs for players to visit and new landing challenges to test their capabilities. Players can also expect Discovery Flights and Bush Trips with enhancements towards the aerial imagery of the entire region. These enhancements come with the help of high-resolution DEM or Digital Elevation Maps for England, Scotland and Ireland.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the new update promises an “improved quality” for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The improvements come through a blend of the latest aerial imagery, digital elevation modelling (including LiDAR coverage), TIN (triangulated irregular network) surface modelling, and hand-crafted airports designed to enhance your gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, Jorg Neumann, further explained that the Big Data world will be shared between the 2020 and 2024 iterations of the games. However, they will not be “two different digital twins,” but cities, POIS, DEM, and aerials will be shared. The difference for the 2024 version will be seen in how the data is optimised and brought to the player, with much of the data stored in the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data stored in the cloud allows the developers to do more, like adding 200 species of trees instead of the original 2023, and be more accurate in depicting the regions in the game. Neuman expanded, stating that “Sophisticated is a keyword” when you describe the latest world update for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Check out their <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/24/biggest-world-update-ever-microsoft-flight-simulator-best-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> here for more details about World Update XVII.&nbsp;</p>

With over 100 billion in revenue, there are more gamers on mobile devices than any other platform. But that’s never been a fair comparison. Mobile games have always been distinct from their console and PC counterparts since mobile games cater to a different audience. But maybe that’s no longer the case?</p><p>At a recent showcase for games coming to Apple devices, I got a peek at what looks to be the next evolution in gaming on mobile: bringing console and PC games straight to your iPhone and iPads.</p><p>Alongside new Apple Arcade exclusives, developers like Ubisoft, Capcom, and EA were in attendance to show off console-level experiences running on the latest Apple machines, ranging from iPhones and iPads to Macbooks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Among the games we saw were Assassin’s Creed Mirage, the newest in Ubisoft’s popular open-world adventure series running flawlessly on an iPhone. This isn’t some watered-down demake like we’ve seen in the past. One game that comes to mind is Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition which is effectively a scaled-down remake of Final Fantasy 15 for mobile devices. </p><p>Mirage was running in full on iPhone, and combined with Ubisoft’s online account system, your save from the console version can transfer over to your iPhone version seamlessly, though you’ll have to purchase a separate version on your iPhone.</p><p>Mirage follows the heels of Capcom games like Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Village. As it happens, Capcom was also there to show off their most recent release, Resident Evil 7 which was running on iPhone and iPad, but is also available to play on Macbook as well.</p><p>Like Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Resident Evil 7 on iOS and Mac is the full experience, rather than some made-for-mobile port. Between these two games and titles already on iOS and Mac like Death Stranding, it appears that the next device to run console quality games is already in your pocket.</p><p>As far as performance goes, I didn’t notice anything particularly egregious. There were a few framerate dips when I played Assassin’s Creed Mirage, but overall these games ran silky smooth. Graphically, these games also impressed. While I wasn’t able to drill down on a proper pixel count, the smaller iPhone screens means whatever loss in detail is covered up by the smaller screen real estate. But even then, games like Resident Evil 7 in particular looked mighty impressive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Apple supports something called Universal Purchase, meaning if you buy a game to play on iPhone, you’ll also be able to play the game on iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro if they support it. But no luck for customers who’ve already purchased games like Resident Evil 7 or Assassin’s Creed on PlayStation or Xbox, which makes sense. But considering a game like RE7 has been out already for several years makes purchasing a full-priced new copy a somewhat bitter pill to swallow. </p><p>There’s also the matter of playing these games. During my experience with the fully ported console games, a controller like the Backbone is almost mandatory. I’ve heard younger gamers who grew up on mobile gaming are quite good at touchscreen controls, but my old dumb hands require tactile buttons. And considering the backbone retails for about $100, though there are certainly cheaper alternatives, is an added cost to get into full-fledged console gaming on mobile.</p><p>It feels to me like mobile gaming is entering new territory. For the longest time, mobile games were smaller affairs, designed to distract you on your commute while finding ways to charge you a few dollars here and there (and generating massive profit doing so), culminating in a world-dominating hit like Pokemon Go. A new era began with the rise of console-lite experiences like Genshin Impact which combined console-quality visuals and gameplay with the gacha mechanics that defines mobile gaming. </p><p>All the while Apple tried a new approach. Taking notes from services like Netflix, Apple launched Apple Arcade, a subscription-service with quality, ad-free games available to subscribers for a monthly fee. This service is home to several, quality indie games as well as huge hits like Hello Kitty Island Adventure.</p><p>And it seems that between Apple Arcade and full AAA game ports, Apple’s found a winning formula for games going forward. Apple Arcade is still in full swing, with hit, mobile-forward games like Vampire Survivor+ slated to arrive for the service, but for gamers looking for something more advanced, there’s a steady stream of AAA games heading to Apple devices.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Not everything will run on every Apple device. At the event we got hands-on with the upcoming Frostpunk 2 and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, but those were only playable on Mac. Though Prince of Persia was also released on the Nintendo Switch, I can’t help but think this title will also make its way to iPhone, even if Ubisoft hasn’t officially announced anything.</p><p>It certainly feels like we’ve entered a new frontier of mobile gaming. While consoles like Steam Deck and Switch have pushed the envelope of mobile console gaming, Apple’s latest moves into pure mobile gaming is certainly worth a deeper dive. There are some lingering questions, like whether Apple will begin offering new games day and date with other platforms, or Apple customers should just expect to get games much later than everyone else.</p><p>But for millions of iPhone and iPad owners around the world, suddenly getting a stream of quality, AAA games right onto devices they already own feels like a surprise revolution.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-finally-ditches-annoying-gas-mask-animation-after-years-of-player-complaints<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since Warzone launched in 2020 players have complained about the Gas Mask animation getting in the way of actually seeing what’s going on. Now, with the launch of Season 5, Activision has finally done something about it.</p><p>Warzone Season 5 launches today, July 24, and brings with it this much-needed improvement. Developer Raven Software’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> detail the ‘Dynamic Gas Mask Overlay Quality of Life’ change:</p><p>“The gas mask overlay will now fade in and out depending if you’re in gas or not,” Raven explained. “This way, players can equip the gas mask at any time without having their vision impacted.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The battle royale’s gas mask, which, as you’d expect, lets players breathe within the damaging gas as the circle of play shrinks, had an equip/unequip animation that would trigger whenever the wearer would move in/out of the gas. It had the habit of getting in the way of the action at the worst possible moment (during a firefight), forcing players to store it in their inventory and manually equip it when needed.</p><p>Now, this issue should be a thing of the past, leaving those with the gas mask free to equip safe in the knowledge that doing so won’t harm their chances of victory. Players have reacted positively to the change, which comes over four years after Warzone’s record-breaking launch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It only took 4 years and 3 months but it has finally happened in Warzone hahahaha</p><p>The Gas Mask Animation is Gone <a href="https://t.co/OI90iR0LRD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OI90iR0LRD</a></p></div>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1816130228647080072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, Season 5 makes big weapon balance changes and other user interface and user experience improvements. The update comes ahead of the launch of this year's mainline Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>, and its integration into Warzone.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>The use of AI in video game development has become a hot-button issue in recent months, especially at the very top of the industry. Now, a wide-ranging report claims that Call of Duty publisher Activision sold cosmetics that were partially made with AI.</p><p dir="ltr">The piece, which comes via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, describes a climate of fear and anxiety surrounding the use of AI in the gaming industry, especially for 2D artists. It opens with a quote from an alleged email from former Activision chief technology officer Michael Vance, stating that artificial intelligence was "top of mind" for the publisher, and that the systems "hold a ton of promise."</p>

<p dir="ltr">An internal memo cited later in the piece apparently approved the use of generative AI tools like GPT-3.5 to create concept art and marketing materials. A cosmetic created by AI was then reportedly released Modern Warfare 3 through the in-game store. The Wired report links to the Yokai's Wrath bundle, which includes a skin, loading screen, sticker, and more, though it's unclear exactly what was generated by AI. </p><p dir="ltr">"I think we all didn’t talk about it much for fear of losing our jobs," a pseudonymous Activision artist identified as "Noah" said. He further claims that "a lot of 2D artists were laid off" in early 2024 when Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, and that the remaining concept artists are being "forced to use AI to aid in their work."</p><p dir="ltr">We've reached out to Activision for comment on this, and we'll update this piece accordingly if we hear back. The Wired report presents the AI issue as one endemic to games, with many top studios and publishers like Riot, EA, and Activision struggling to determine the proper use of the technology. The report also suggests that the AI boom has triggered further interest in organizing activity within the industry, which may help explain how large studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda</a> have become fully unionized in recent weeks.</p>

There was no TikTok, DLC was still a relatively new concept on consoles, <em>Fortnite</em> didn’t exist, and covid-19 wasn’t a thing. But what if <em>Skyrim </em>launched in 2024? And what if it was written and developed by 13-year-olds? Well, you don’t have to wonder, because YouTuber CJMattis has created a video that presents us with that alternate timeline. </p><p>Using AI-generated voices, CJMattis has rewritten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">the famous intro to <em>Skyrim</em></a></span><em> </em>in which you wake up on a wagon alongside a few other captured prisoners as you all await your execution. Now all the characters use “Gen Alpha Slang,” according to the video’s title. </p><p>So instead of saying “Watch your tongue!” when someone in the cart speaks poorly of Ulfric Stormcloak, we get “Check your vibes!” When the person realizes who they are talking to they freak out, saying: “You’re the leader of the rizz-bellion!” At another point, someone asks what gooncave someone is from after he starts to panic and yell out, “No, this is cap. This must be cap.” </p><p>Here’s the original <em>Skyrim </em>intro in case you want to compare.</p><p>I do think that some of the “Gen Alpha” slang in this video is actually much older internet speak, like ratioed and doxx. And I’m not sure a reference to Twitch streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479">Kai Cenat</a></span> is slang, but hey, what do I know? I’m an old man. Besides, the main point of the video is to rot your brain, and it does a solid job of that. </p><p>Although, personally, I don’t mind kids using new words because that’s how this whole language thing works. That’s how this has always worked. The youth develop new words and phrases, their parents and teachers roll their eyes, and then 10 years later those kids—now teens—roll their eyes at the new kids and their fresh slang. Repeat until the heat death of the universe. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/24/playback-outland/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><em>Nearly 10 years on, the Playback series returns to revisit games from years past.</em></p>
<p>In 2011, Housemarque released Outland, its unique and only 2D platformer. It tends to be overlooked within the company’s impressive catalogue of games, overshadowed by hits like Resogun, Super Stardust Delta, and Returnal. Nevertheless, Outland emerged during a phase of experimentation for Housemarque, and its impact is noticeable in many later titles, from the particle-like graphics that distinguished Resogun to the varied enemy styles that may have inspired those in Returnal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Outland - Reveal Trailer [Europe]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bcc949DAWPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Outland has also been in my Steam library for years, languishing with zero minutes of play, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a go. You play as a nameless Hero who has visions of a battle from 30,000 years ago which sees another nameless hero fight the Sisters of Light &amp; Dark, before imprisoning them. The Sisters are nearing their escape, and your character, a descendant of the original Hero, is charged with the task of preventing their escape and thwarting their plans to destroy the world. To be honest, while it’s narrated well enough, Outland’s story is not particularly engrossing or interesting, playing into all-too-familiar story beats.</p>
<p>What Outland did do when it released was play on the dual identity of the Hero, who can switch between red and blue forms. These forms correspond to the light and dark forms of the Sisters and plays into the gameplay too. The different zones have enemies and puzzles that are colour-coded red and blue, so your character’s colour matters. In Outland, the red form can combat blue enemies and navigate through red traps with minimal damage, and the blue form has the same capabilities. The game gradually introduces this mechanic, increasing the difficulty level as you progress. Initially, you get accustomed to the basic controls, but soon you will be leaping across colour-coded platforms, needing to switch between red and blue forms swiftly. While the combat is relatively basic, even with the colour-switching element, and the variety of enemies is decent, the game’s boss fights are less compelling, ranging from tedious, like the golem encounters, to frustrating, such as a dragon battle.</p>

<p>Abilities are unlocked progressively in the game, from granting players a charge attack to moving up to a beam attack capable of eliminating multiple enemies or inflicting significant damage on bosses. Additionally, you can unlock environmental features such as teleporters, which provide access to previously visited levels, and leap pads that allow exploration of new world areas. Earning coins by exploring and defeating enemies enables you to enhance the hero’s health and increase the hero’s abilities’ charge capacity. However, obtaining these upgrades in Outland is not straightforward; it’s not merely a matter of accessing a menu and allocating points. Players must venture through Outland to discover upgrade statues, which are often hidden away from the main paths.</p>

<p>Outland’s visual design still holds up today, and there are moments where you see how the decisions made in Outland have influenced the future games, as well as building on the Housemarque games that came before. The final boss has designs elements that would not look out of place from Resogun or Returnal, and you cna see the developer’s trademark style starting to form. The music also deserves a special mention, elevating even those boring fights into something more frantic and engaging. It just sets up that some of these battles are meant to be epic in scale, and the final boss theme is incredible, even if the fight itself is basic.</p>
<p>Outland has become one of those games that’s increasingly difficult to add to your games library. It’s no longer available on Steam or the PlayStation Network, but you can still purchase it on the Xbox Store. Alternatively, you can obtain a physical Xbox 360 copy through the Ubisoft Triple Pack, which includes Outland, From Dust, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD, which has backward compatibility.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a set of statistics showing how players engaged with&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s various activities, and the game's cat quest has proven surprisingly (or perhaps completely unsurprisingly) popular.</p>
<p>While Sony and Team Ninja's open-world epic has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-showcases-dynamic-storytelling-player-choices-and-bonds-with-characters">deep historical narrative to discover</a> and plenty of the developer's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-combat-deep-dive">signature action</a> to enjoy, it turns out that finding and cuddling every cat in the game is an important activity for a number of players.</p>
<p>According to Sony, 16% of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>players collected every cat. That's 100 cats in total, which is a lot of wandering around Edo-period Japan. I haven't played this one yet, but I'll definitely be adding to this statistic when I do.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats-gun.jpg?itok=G4wY0kfS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats-gun.jpg?itok=V7EUOzsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>may have plenty of killing in it, but cats are more diverting.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's cats have proven so popular that in the latest update, a feature was added whereby you can get reacquainted with cats you've already met near Usugumo Dayu, so you can while away your hours simply loving cats and refusing to engage with the story. What a rush!</p>
<p>If you're not a cat lover, then there are plenty of other interesting statistics to pore over. Be aware that minor story spoilers for&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>follow, so if you're looking to go in without knowing anything, avert your eyes.</p>
<p>When given the choice between sparing or killing Gonzo in the main story, 35% of players chose to kill him, while 65% chose to spare him. 62% of players sided with the shogunate and 38% with anti-shogunate forces, which surprises me.</p>
<p>51% of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>players opted for Dusk, the game's "normal" difficulty mode, while 36% played on the easier Dawn difficulty and 13% opted to challenge themselves by playing on the Twilight mode.</p>

<h2>Give Team Ninja's latest a try yourself with the&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>demo</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/explore-the-top-choices-in-rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fascinating statistics</a> aren't all you're getting by way of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>goodies today.</p>
<p>If you're yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, you'll be pleased to know that a demo is now available <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Store</a>, so you can see whether this one is for you or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-humble-games-situation-gets-messier-with-claims-of-lies-and-damage-control/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p><strong>UPDATE (12:05 PM ET):</strong> Humble Games has denied using AI to write the statement put out by the company regarding the layoffs and restructuring. </p>



<p>In addition to that, a spokesperson for the company says that “Humble Games and Ziff Davis are not commenting further about the ongoing restructuring at this time.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: On Tuesday it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/humble-games-lays-off-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that layoffs were happening</a> at Humble Games, a subsidiary of IGN Entertainment. Despite many believing it was a closure of the publishing studio, the company put out a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/humble-games-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying that it was a “restructure”</a> rather than a closure of Humble Games.</p>



<p>Now, nearly 24 hours later, the situation is only getting messier. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, former Humble Bundle creative lead Chris Radley <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> that what was happening was “NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of Humble Games.”</p>



<p>He continued: <em>“Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left. DO NOT believe this AI message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was ONCE AGAIN a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative and its so disrespectful.”</em></p>



<p>What’s more is that <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a> was sent a recording that confirmed that all current Humble Games projects would be handled by The Powell Group, a third-party company.</p>



<p>Steve Horowitz, president of technology and shopping at Ziff Davis, said that the company failed multiple times to sell Humble Games before deciding to shut it down. Horowitz said that attempts to sell the company didn’t produce “a viable offer or outcome”.</p>



<p>He then went on to say that the company has seen “an additional millions increase in development expenses” leading to a “very tough but necessary decision to restructure all of Humble Games”.</p>



<p>“As such, we’re gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalog,” Horowitz said. “As a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted.”</p>



<p>Despite being called a “restructure”, there are no employees left at Humble Games. The company, for all intents and purposes, is no more aside from a name. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has once again reached out to IGN Entertainment and their parent company Ziff Davis for more clarification. Specially, we have asked about the claims that the statement was written by AI and how the company will move forward with no employees.</p>



<p>Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload.935664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816128743888609327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, reliable leaker HYPEX supported leaks by SpushFNBR and KPMisParrot that tease the Desert Biome may be coming to Reload. </p>



<p>Loosely translated from the post <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1816126192711524462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by SpushFNBR</a>, a material with the same codename as Chapter 1’s desert biome was modified in version 30.30. </p>



<p>This implies that the Fortnite team could be working on reintroducing the desert biome. SamLeakss, also notable for Fortnite leaks, further supported the desert biome should be added to Reload “soon.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The desert biome of chapter one remains a beloved and nostalgic area, though it didn’t offer many named locations. </p>



<p>Fortnite Reload is the 40-player Battle Royale game with central reboot mechanics. It continues to thrive well enough, though fans are looking forward to another big update for Reload.</p>



<p>In addition to Reload, other recent Fortnite leaks pointed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-introduce-a-deadpool-wolverine-bundle-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential tie-in bundle</a> for the upcoming film Deadpool and Wolverine. </p>



<p>Just today, Fortnite did update its X social account with artwork teasing a Deadpool takeover. This adds a lot of validity to previous leaks about the bundle.</p>



<p>Fortnite just released its massive v30.30 update this week. The update introduces a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/">Fall Guys collaboration</a>, a new season of Rocket Racing, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive Tesla Cybertruck</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, the Fortnite team did not officially confirm anything about the desert biome making a big return.</p>
