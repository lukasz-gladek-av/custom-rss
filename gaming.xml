            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have announced that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales have reached another major milestone less than three weeks after the game's release.</p>
<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed two million sales since launching on April 26th, which means it's sold another million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count">hitting its first million on April 29th</a>.</p>
<p>The game's success is no big surprise given that it was one of the most wishlisted titles on Steam leading up to its release, not to mention its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count">impressive player count on launch day</a>, but Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse's achievement is commendable nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-armies.jpg?itok=oYpgF2IV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-armies.jpg?itok=f7yR6bRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has proven a runaway hit for developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse.</figcaption></figure><p>Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender says the company "had some pretty optimistic expectations" for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, as well as some less realistic "wild hopes", but that the two million figure has "exceeded even those".</p>
<p>Slavic Magic, meanwhile, hasn't commented on the sales milestone, instead <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1791065617002328457" rel="noopener" target="_blank">taking to X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>&nbsp;to express admiration for a&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>VR mod. Better hope he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-mods-discussion-banned-on-official-discord">doesn't take that discussion to the game's Discord</a>, eh?</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a city-builder with RTS and grand strategy elements (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet">very much not a&nbsp;<em>StarCraft&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor</a>) developed by tiny studio Slavic Magic.</p>
<p>Despite the title's plural, you play as a single manor lord, growing your medieval settlement by managing resources, overseeing production chains, and even fighting battles when the need arises.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-village-aerial.jpg?itok=h16pqTKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-village-aerial.jpg?itok=o9n1YikW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is scratching a lot of strategy itches.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is in Early Access right now, which means there are still a fair few bugs and issues to work out, but developer Slavic Magic has been hard at work fixing those problems, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-beta-none-glitch">the infamous "None" glitch</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

  <p id="6lZvmm">Dearest Reader,</p>
<p id="UBiz7h">Another season (of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>) is upon us, and once again, it is filled to the brim with romance and scandal. As your ever-watchful Lady Polydown, it is my duty to assess all the comings and goings of the Ton, and let my gentle readers know who is worth keeping an eye on — after all, there are so very many members, but not all of them are as compelling as others! </p>
<p id="oizT5Q">This season, all eyes turn to Miss Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). After two seasons of watching her pine for her best friend Mr. Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), it’s high time this wallflower takes matters into her own hands! </p>
<p id="mOuYG1">But is Mr. Colin worthy of Miss Penelope’s affections? This is a conundrum that has puzzled me season after season. Miss Penelope has been nothing but a loyal, devoted, and supportive friend to him. Whilst away from her company, Mr. Colin has changed a great deal, but is his newfound sturdiness and swagger enough to mend the wounds on Miss Penelope’s heart? </p>

<p id="7vimGq">Mr. Colin’s affections, at least, <em>do </em>change this season, after Miss Penelope enlists his help to attract a suitor. Her brief flirtation with the reclusive naturalist Lord Debling (Sam Phillips) is actually most compelling — though it is clear that even if they would make a lovely match on paper, her heart may still be stuck on an old chapter. But this author wishes there were a <em>bit</em> more proof of Mr. Colin’s feelings, beyond a couple of heated dreams. </p>
<p id="5jJBsD">As for Miss Penelope’s side venture as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler"><em>other</em> gossipmonger</a>… let’s just say it has not been forgotten. It lingers, especially because it utterly destroyed her relationship with one Miss Eloise Bridgerton. And this season, Miss Eloise (Claudia Jessie) is in the company of Miss Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), the past few seasons’ continual villain. Yet, if there’s a glimmer to be found, it’s this facet, a development that yields an actually meaningful friendship, giving Miss Cowper’s character depth and maturity. What a surprise to find myself rooting for this previously unlikeable debutante! Even when she’s plotting against Miss Penelope, I am sympathetic, now that we know more about why Miss Cowper is the way she is. And the friendship she shares with Miss Eloise is particularly evocative, as three seasons in they are both shunned by the current marriageable market. </p>

<p id="7PTpWv">But the love story that has captured the heart of this author isn’t the one at the center of the season. No, it is the one between shy Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) and the stoic Jonathan Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli)<strong>.</strong> Miss Francesca would simply like to be left alone this season, and the only one who understands that is Lord Kilmartin. Compared to the big flashy courtships of her siblings, Miss Francesa’s is incredibly subdued and quiet — and yet, it is a different sort of romance, one we’ve yet to see in previous seasons, and one that has completely stolen my heart. The Queen may not approve, but this author is utterly charmed! </p>
<p id="iv4has">Ah, the Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and his new bride Kate Bridgerton, nee Sharma (Simone Ashley) have returned from their honeymoon — and they are here to kiss and look very beautiful. Do they add much to the fraught pageantry of this current season? Not particularly, but they are so very darling and in love (and also, they do not take up <em>too</em> much time away from the main action). I acknowledge that I am being completely and shamelessly catered to, yet I do not care, as it fills my heart with joy to see this happy couple once again. </p>

<p id="3MuxB7">Meanwhile, Mr. Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson) has once again found himself cavorting around town and getting caught up with yet another woman introduced just this season. The one thing Mr. Benedict had going for him was his love of art and painting, but after finding out that his brother paid for his admission into the Royal Academy of Art, Mr. Benedict made quite the ruckus, and consequently abandoned his artistic pursuits. And yet, without his proclivity for the paintbrush, where does that leave Mr. Benedict? A boring bachelor, that is what. Now, all he does this season is sneak around with his sexually bold lover, without even really interacting with his siblings or doing much else of interest. </p>
<p id="ynSguB">What has most befuddled me most, dear readers, is the constant fixation on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22991651/bridgerton-season-1-recap-season-2">Mr. Will Mordich</a> (Martins Imhangbe) and his family. If that name does not ring a bell, don’t feel guilty; I certainly would not have remembered his name, were he not the owner of what was once a popular club. But thanks to a distant relative’s perplexing will, which leaves a lordship to Mr. Mordich’s eldest child, the Mordich family is thrust into high society. A noble effort, but one that still singles them out from the rest of the Ton’s players. Yes, Mr. Mordich is good friends with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix">Duke of Hastings</a>, but the Duke has been off with his lovely Daphne for two seasons now. Too often, Mr. Mordich and his family feel too minuscule when isolated against the spectacle of the rest of the season. What is the point? I do not know, but at least it is charming to see the child lord learning about silverware.</p>

<p id="7BbHqx">As for elsewhere on the Ton, well, they all get some sort of minor plotline. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/28/22203598/bridgerton-characters-essay-marriage">Dowager Viscountess Violet Bridgerton</a> (Ruth Gemmell) finds herself smitten with her dear friend Lady Danbury’s brother (which I, personally, am in favor of, considering we learned in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709730/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-review"><em>Queen Charlotte</em></a> that Lady Danbury once had an affair with Lady Violet’s father back in the day). The Featherington sisters, meanwhile, are racing to produce a male heir with their husbands — a most amusing plot to see these clueless young couples be romantic together (what matches made in heaven!). And of course, the queen is determined to oust Lady Whistledown, though that game has been at a bit of a stalemate for a while now. </p>
<p id="x1juSg">I am torn, dear readers. On one hand, I came to this season expecting some delicious romance and I have most surely gotten that! Not just between Miss Penelope and Mr. Colin, but also between Miss Francesca and her surprisingly charming suitor. And other relationships continue to intrigue me, like Miss Eloise and Miss Cowper’s unexpected friendship. Yet, there are so many superfluous people to keep track of this season, to the point where I am wondering why their actions are even worth paying attention to. That is, alas, the <em>Bridgerton</em> dilemma: for every interesting sibling and their romantic partner, there are dozens of dull stories twisting in and out of their lives (some with looser connective threads than others). </p>
<p id="FfCmjZ">But even when the sea is calm, the tides of courtship may yet turn. After all, the season is still young. There is plenty of time for those less enlightening individuals to become a little bit more interesting (and for Mr. Benedict to remember he has a passion for something other than bedding rich widows). We shall see what the second half of the season holds for us. Till then, this lighthouse keeper waits atop her tower, a watchful eye cast across the Ton. </p>
<p id="VxhDFB">Yours Truly,</p>
<p id="eHts7I"><em>Lady Polydown</em></p>
<p id="eT7A4w"><small>The first half of Bridgerton season 3 is out on Netflix now. The second half (also four episodes) arrives on June 16. </small></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Star Wars has invaded every inch of our culture, including Star Wars toys, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-star-wars-lego-sets-in-2022">Star Wars LEGO sets</a>, and even the tabletop. It may come as a surprise, but the slate of board and roleplaying games based on this popular intellectual property includes several absolutely killer options. </p><p>The diversity here is strong. There are smaller, less complex options, as well as sprawling games with mounds of miniatures. Each of these titles offers a compelling experience that captures aspects of this beloved film series. All of these are currently available and can be picked up and played right now.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Star Wars Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/PgY0A" target="_blank">Star Wars: Shatterpoint</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jPgbv" target="_blank">Star Wars: Unlimited</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/x3bJY" target="_blank">Star Wars: Jabba's Palace - A Love Letter Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5pXlV" target="_blank">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5pXlV" target="_blank">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5LxAY" target="_blank">Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w4kJK" target="_blank">Star Wars: Outer Rim</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/e15v5" target="_blank">Star Wars: X-Wing (2nd Edition)</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/XbX8x" target="_blank">Star Wars: Armada</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/y5Vm0" target="_blank">Star Wars: Imperial Assault</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jnJlv" target="_blank">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/nLm28" target="_blank">Star Wars: Destiny</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2vK6e" target="_blank">Star Wars: Legion</a></li></ul><p>Short on time? Click the links above to check out each game on the list. Read on for details about each one.</p><h2>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</h2><div id="183081"><p><h3>Star Wars Shatterpoint - Core Set</h3></p></div><p>Shatterpoint is the newest Star Wars tabletop design. This comes from Atomic Mass Games, the studio that took over X-Wing and Legion, and which conceived the exceptional Marvel Crisis Protocol miniatures game. They are fully behind this new release and have already released many additional miniatures with shiny new content.  </p><p>Following in the footsteps of Crisis Protocol, Shatterpoint focuses on a small number of units with players fielding squads from the Clone Wars era. Aesthetically, it’s a more vibrant and focused experience in comparison to Legion. The larger-sized 40mm miniatures are impressive and offer a striking presentation. Gameplay is dynamic and swift with several unique flourishes. It is rather detailed, however, and offers plenty of tactical fat to chew on. This comes at the cost of complexity, which can occasionally bog down play. For those looking to engage in this exciting new title, you will find a rather sophisticated game full of modern touches. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review">Star Wars: Shatterpoint review</a> for more detail.</p><h2>Star Wars: Unlimited</h2><div id="196833"><p><h3>Star Wars: Unlimited</h3></p></div><p>Following the success of 2023’s Disney Lorcana, the trading game format has found new life. Disney wants to keep the cash flowing, and that’s arriving courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Unlimited. This one has just hit the market and is generating a great deal of buzz. With a little focus, you can hear the millions of wallets crying out in terror.</p><p>Gameplay is relatively straightforward and leans into concepts common to the TCG format. You spend resources to put new equipment, characters, and vehicles into play. One novel concept is alternating actions, following a pattern common to miniatures skirmish games. This establishes a unique cadence to play that offers some distinction from its peers. Veering away from Decipher’s old CCG, they’ve opted for new illustrations as opposed to stills from the films. This helps to bolster the game’s personality and enhance its attraction. We were able to get our hands on an early copy of the two starter decks, and you can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-the-death-star-star-wars-unlimited-has-incredible-power-and-a-notable-flaw">read our preview</a> for additional thoughts. </p><h2><strong>Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace - A Love Letter Game</strong></h2><div id="196834"><p><h3>Star Wars Jabba's Palace A Love Letter Game</h3></p></div><p>Love Letter is the popular card game that made serious waves in 2012. It’s seen a large amount of spinoffs since, including Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace. This functions much like the other variants, taking the core framework of Love Letter and adding a twist to freshen up the experience.</p><p>Players choose between two cards to play each turn. Each has a different effect and includes iconic characters from Return of the Jedi. For instance, Boba Fett allows you to take a card from another player, while Salacious Crumb lets you look at their hand. The goal is to outlast your opponents by using a degree of intuition and bluffing. This particular edition adds a new Agenda mechanism which changes scoring each round. It’s a solid changeup that adds some variety and tactical nuance to play. This is a simple game, one that is appropriate for a wide age range. Better yet, it’s incredibly cheap. </p><h2>Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</h2><div id="177415"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p>If you and a friend or family member want to duke it out in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game is an excellent choice. Rather than making you buy booster packs to assemble a deck, this standalone game comes with all the cards you need to pit the Reble Alliance against the Empire. It's a great pick for newcomers to deckbuilding games, but it has enough depth and strategy for diehard fans. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</h2><div id="179755"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p></div><p>If you've played Pandemic (and not just by living through one!), you know the basics for how this game works. Set during the Clone Wars era of Star Wars, this board game pits the Jedi against Count Dooku and the Sith Lord's forces. It comes with four scenarios to play through, giving it lots of replay value. </p><h2>Star Wars: Armada</h2><div id="165959"><p><h3>Star Wars: Armada</h3></p></div><p>One thought everyone had when they saw how fantastic the X-Wing miniatures looked was to wonder what a Star Destroyer would look like. In that thought, Armada was born. It has the same great pre-painted ships, but the action has moved from tactical dogfights to epic fleet combat.</p><p>Along with the change in scale, the tone and feel of the game has also changed. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">Two players</a> still pick a roster of ships and upgrades. But Armada is a more stately, strategic affair compared to the frantic dice-offs and cartoon action of its predecessor. What it loses in intimacy, it gains in depth.</p><p>Armada has another advantage: although individual ships are expensive, you need fewer of them. And there are fewer to choose from than X-Wing. So although the rules are more complex, the game as a whole is easier to get your head around.</p><h2>Star Wars Villainous: Power of The Dark Side</h2><div id="165965"><p><h3>Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side</h3></p></div><p>Following on from 2018’s very successful <a href="https://zdcs.link/A5oB0" target="_blank">Disney Villanous</a>, this amped-up version lets you pilot some of the most famous villains from the Star Wars franchise to succeed in their evil plots. You’ll need to shepherd resources and cards wisely as you pursue your character’s unique objective, such as Darth Vader turning Luke to the dark side. But beware: other characters can draw from your fate deck and play pesky heroes and deleterious events onto your board, setting your plans awry unless you can deal with them. With new resources and the potential to move into deep space, this is a more complex and challenging game than the original, but it pays off with crunchier strategy and more engaging theme. </p><h2>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h2><div id="165957"><p><h3>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h3></p></div><p>Star Wars games tend to focus on the epic struggle or the details of one battle. Outer Rim fills the wide gap between with a strategic story of the lives of the scum and villains who ply their trade on the galaxy's edge. Except since they're your scum and villains, it's up to you how villainous you want them to be.</p><p>As you fly missions and smuggle cargo from system to system, your choices will shape your character. The cleverly linked mission cards give each game a cohesive but unique narrative. You'll upgrade your skills and ship along the way. But whether you choose to be a heroic rogue or a sky bounty hunter is up to you. Why not both?</p><p>Of course, this being a board game there are numbers to juggle, dice to roll and resources to manage. It'll take both luck shrewd wits to be the galaxies greatest rascal. Much like real life, really. Also check out our rundown of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">best strategy board games</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition</h2><div id="165958"><p><h3>Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition</h3></p></div><p>The success of this tactical space fighting game has spawned imitations across the hobby. But X-Wing has two things its mimics do not. First, it's Star Wars. Second, the figures are pre-painted to a high standard, so you can have amazing-looking games for zero effort. And if you collected Star Wars toys as a kid, the nostalgia appeal is impossible to ignore.</p><p>The game became a victim of its own popularity, bloated with confusing expansions. But a second edition has cleaned things up and added a bunch of cool rules tweaks. Now, as well as the squad building and hidden movement tactics of the original, you can deploy force powers to aid your cause. Existing players can get upgrade kits with new dials and cards for their collection.</p><p>And the core game remains fantastic fun, a fast-paced snapshot of movie action. There are ship lines not only for Rebels and the Empire, but ones from the prequels and newer films, alongside iconic rogues in Scum and Villainy. Also check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">best war board games</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h2><div id="165960"><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><p>Spaceship combat in Star Wars is spectacular, but it's not where the real heart of the films is. That's in the unfolding story, the Jedi powers, the blaster battles. It's in Han and Leia, Luke and his father. If that's where you are with the movies, Imperial Assault is your game.</p><p>Borrowing heavily from the mechanics of dungeon-crawling game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent</a>, this is a grid combat game. You set up a map of interlocking tiles and play out a battle between Imperial and Rebel forces using plastic models of film characters. Turn by turn you need to position your models and use their abilities to best effect in order to win an edge over the opposition.</p><p>That's only half the story. This is two games using similar mechanics. One is a battle game where you pick your models and fight it out. The other is an ongoing adventure where one player controls the Imperial forces and the others Rebel heroes. Over the course of many sessions you'll see your own Star Wars saga unfold. Whichever way you prefer to play there are a vast number of expansions to extend your game.</p><h2>Star Wars: Rebellion</h2><div id="158890"><p><h3>Star Wars: Rebellion</h3></p></div><p>If controlling Star Destroyers or AT-AT's isn't big enough for you, how about a Death Star? In fact, how about several Death Stars? That's what's waiting for you in this grand board game, which lets you replay the entire rebellion on your dinner table.</p><p>Of course, as befits the movies, the Rebel player can't hope to hold a holo-candle to the might of the Imperial navy. But they don't have to: they have to fight a clandestine war of insurgency and politics, swaying planets to join them while poking thorns in the Imperial side. The Emperor and his minions, meanwhile, merely need to destroy the Rebel base to win. Except they have to find out where it's hidden first.</p><p>Rebellion takes a long time to play, but it's engrossing, strategic and surprisingly characterful. Players do get to control a lot of popular film heroes and villains, albeit relegated to a single card.</p><h2>Star Wars: Destiny</h2><div id="165961"><p><h3>Star Wars: Destiny</h3></p></div><p>In a move as bold as Obi-Wan confronting Grievous, Destiny resurrects the collectible card game. You begin with a fixed starter set, either Rey or Kylo Ren, and expand it with blind boosters. From this collection you build decks that span across space and time, featuring the likes of Count Dooku pairing up with General Hux.</p><p>The unique hook is that Destiny isn't only about playing cards - you’ll be tossing dice around, too. Each character in your deck brings custom dice to the fight, and rolling them partly dictates what you can do with your turn. While this might sound a strategic no-no, it keeps the game varied, fast and exciting, much like the battles it seeks to re-create.</p><p>Plus, the variety of the dice themselves help build tactical options. Dice that are more reliable are also less flexible, so it's up to you how you build your force.</p><h2>Star Wars: Legion</h2><div id="165963"><p><h3>Star Wars: Legion</h3></p></div><p>Legion is the ground-based equivalent to X-Wing, a miniatures title with troops and tanks instead of spaceships. The miniatures don't come painted or assembled for this. But don't let that put you off. Publisher Fantasy Flight has learned well from other popular miniatures games and put out a doozy.</p><p>At heart, there's the measuring and moving, estimating and dice rolling you'd expect from a game of this type. Two clever tweaks to the formula catapult the game to the next level. First is the activation system in which you have to balance moving what you want against when you want to move it: you won't get both. Second is the card-based scenario creation which puts a tactical twist on making each game unique.</p><p>There are sculpts of all your favorite characters and vehicles from the movies to expand your collection. The fact they make up a varied strategic challenge to build an effective army is just a bonus.</p><h2>Star Wars Board Game FAQs</h2><h2>What is a miniatures game, and how do the various Star Wars ones differ?</h2><p>Miniatures games share a lot of DNA with board games which, confusingly, often have miniatures as playing pieces. The difference is twofold. Firstly, miniatures games have much higher quality figures and for many players, painting and converting them is an additional hobby in its own right. Second, miniatures games are generally played on an open table with scenery of your choice, on which you move pieces by measuring distances with a tool or tape measure, rather than a fixed board with spaces.</p><p>There are currently four different Star Wars miniatures games, a reflection of the franchise's popularity and visual appeal. The easiest one to get into is space dogfighting game X-Wing, which comes with fantastic pre-painted starfighters, like the iconic titular ship and TIE fighter. It has the simplest rules of the four, you don't have to do any modelling at all, the starter set is fun to play with by itself, and you don't even really need any scenery. Next up is Armada, which represents fleet level action with pre-painted scale models of huge capital ships like the Star Destroyer. Although it has a smaller range of models they're also more expensive and you'll need more than just the starter box to properly appreciate what it offers. Some of the expansion content comes with miniscule starfighter wings, and they won't look great next to your painted models unless you take the plunge and paint them up yourself.</p><p>The ground combat games, Star Wars: Shatterpoint and Star Wars: Legion are very different beasts, as both come with unpainted models and the expectation is very much that you'll paint them up yourself.  You'll also need a collection of scenery although both starter boxes come with some for you to play with. Shatterpoint uses bigger models for smaller-scale action, skirmishes between famous characters from the Star Wars franchises. It's the most complex of all four games but rewards you with movie-like narrative action. Legion depicts bigger battles and is slightly more anonymous in the sense that most of your forces will be stormtroopers or rebel soldiers, with the occasional better-known character as a leader. But while its easier to learn, you'll also have a lot more painting to do to get those larger forces tabletop ready!</p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-90s-board-games">best '90s board games</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/forever-entertainment-on-making-what-was-old-new-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The publisher talks about how and why remakes such as Front Mission 2 are a part of its business model</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Remaking games is not easy. You have to consider how retro titles will play on modern consoles and for today's audiences. You also have to work on the finer details, such as the clarity of dialogue, balancing gameplay, and quality-of-life changes. The list goes on.</p>
<p>However, when remakes become a part of your business model, you have it figured out. Forever Entertainment has proven itself in this field with the remakes of Panzer Dragoon, The House of The Dead, Front Mission 1st, and Front Mission 2. In 2018, it announced that it is also developing the Panzer Dragoon 2: Zwei remake.</p>
<p>Communications and marketing manager Monika Ginter tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> that the firm's focus on retro titles spans from genuine interest from the team.</p>
<blockquote>"We are currently working on both announced and unannounced titles. Remakes are one of the pillars of our operations"</blockquote>
<p>She says, "We are fans of old games — they had a big impact on our lives, and we wanted a modern-day player to be able to experience the classics of our childhood, too. We think this is still a niche in the market that will gain more and more interest over time. Every year, we try to release an increasing number of remakes, and we are currently working on both announced and unannounced titles. Remakes are one of the pillars of our operations."</p>
<p>For clarity, Ginter explains the distinction between remake and remaster titles for consumers.</p>
<p>"Often, people confuse a remaster with a remake, but the latter involves starting from scratch and demands a considerable amount of work. While our remake versions may appear similar to the originals in terms of mechanics, we invest significant effort by closely analyzing the original to build our games entirely from the ground up," she explains.</p>
<p>Ginter continues, "We firmly believe that gaming classics deserve more than just a 'straight port.' The popularity of our past remakes indicates a growing support for this niche among gamers, and we are dedicated to delivering new releases that not only revive the classics but elevate them to new heights.</p>
<p>"One of the most important aspects for us when creating remakes is finding the balance between the old and the new. It is crucial to preserve the spirit of the original while incorporating improvements that the modern-day player expects."</p>
<p>Ginter says past releases paved the way for the firm to focus further on its remake output. To this point, Forever approached Square Enix with the proposal of remaking the first three Front Mission titles. She says that their past successful remake releases helped with those negotiations.</p>
<blockquote>"We have many fans of turn-based strategy games...it's always better to work on what you love"</blockquote>
<p>"As a publisher and developer, we are always on the lookout for new opportunities. Remakes presented an interesting challenge and, in a way, a realization of our own ambitions — after all, who wouldn't want to create their own version of games played in their youth?" she explains.</p>
<p>"Additionally, within [Forever Entertainment], we have many fans of turn-based strategy games, and we operate on the principle that it's always better to work on what you love."</p>
<p>Forever released Front Mission 2 Remake on additional platforms last month. It was released on the Nintendo Switch last year. The strategy game was originally launched in 1997 for the PlayStation 1 in Japan by Square Enix. The title had not received an English or Western release before its re-release.</p>

<p>Front Mission games feature multiple characters and large political plots, making them text-heavy RPGs. When remaking the second game, Forever also localized it in multiple languages and balance gameplay. Ginter explains that the company relied on its previous work and experience to take on the task.</p>
<p>"We take an individual approach to each game," she explains. "Recognizing the historical significance and RPG elements of the Front Mission series, we prioritized providing support for multiple languages. This ensures a comfortable gaming experience and broadens the audience. While we have previously localized several RPGs into different languages, such as Rise Eterna, Front Mission represents our most extensive localization project to date, undertaken entirely from scratch."</p>
<p>Regarding the project scope, Ginter says that English script translations for Front Mission 1 and Front Mission 2 totaled nearly 140,000 words. Localizing each title involved ensuring the narrative, dialogue, and text conveyed the essence of their original scripts.</p>
<p>"While working on remakes, we are in constant contact with IP owners; this ensures the balance between introducing quality-of-life changes and preserving the essential elements of the original game. Our aim is to make the game accessible to newcomers to the series while retaining the depth and detail that are iconic to the Front Mission series."</p>
<p>Ginter explains that Forever received guidance from Square Enix during the development process. However, it also consulted various Japanese-language sources, including the original game guides, to ensure the strategy RPGs were consistent with the franchise's lore. While working on these remakes, the publisher was also aware that it had to meet expectations.</p>
<p>She explains, "Developing a game that satisfies the nostalgia of long-time fans while also captivating a new audience, essentially breathing a second life into the series, is no easy feat. With each new remake, we strive for continuous improvement, and it seems we are succeeding, thanks in part to the valuable feedback from our players."</p>
<blockquote>"Developing a game that satisfies the nostalgia of long-time fans while also captivating a new audience, essentially breathing a second life into the series, is no easy feat"</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the quality of life and gameplay features, Ginter says that Forever is receptive to balancing games based on user feedback. In one case, a bug existed within one of the last stages in Front Mission 2. A cutscene would not trigger the mission's end, and the bug was eventually patched after it was brought to the company's attention.</p>
<p>Ginter explains, "We always consider what players want in terms of quality-of-life improvements while maintaining a balance between introducing new features and keeping the essential elements of the series intact. Our commitment doesn't end at the game's release — we continuously listen to player feedback and roll out updates that address issues and add new features.</p>
<blockquote>"We consider the Nintendo Switch as the ideal platform for various classic remakes"</blockquote>
<p>"In The House of The Dead: Remake, we introduced new game modes like the Horde mode, and there's now a gallery with achievements, unlockable weapons, and a model viewer featuring all enemies. These updates reflect our dedication to enhancing the gaming experience based on the valuable feedback we receive from players."</p>
<p>Regarding the target audience for remakes, Ginter says that the Switch serves as the go-to console for Forever's releases.</p>
<p>"Until now, our remakes have focused on games from Japan, and Japanese gamers have shown great excitement for our updated versions of classics. In terms of platforms, we consider the Nintendo Switch as the ideal platform for various classic remakes. We appreciate the accessibility of the Nintendo Switch. With a diverse user base, our games can reach a broad audience, including those who may not have encountered classics like Front Mission or Panzer Dragoon before."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/1997s-fightnjoke-gets-re-release-with-online-multiplayer-and-rollback-netcode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=1997s-fightnjoke-gets-re-release-with-online-multiplayer-and-rollback-netcode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Mental Drink has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328400/FightNJokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a new version</a> of 1997’s MS-DOS title <em>Fight’n’Joke</em>, which doesn’t have any relation with 2017’s <em>Fight’n Rage</em> (that I know of). This re-release is pretty lavish, featuring rollback netcode and online multiplayer. That’s swinging for the fences.</p> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">If you hadn’t heard of <em>Fight’n’Joke</em>, neither had I. It’s hard to overstate the massive impact that 1991’s <em>Street Fighter II</em> had on the game industry, so the ‘90s were packed to the rafters with fighting games looking to get in on that sweet, sweet success. This also resulted in a few parody games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/weekly-kusoge-clayfighter-sculptors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clay Fighter</a></em> and <em>Brutal: Paws of Fury</em>. DOS wasn’t exactly the most happening place for fighting games, however. If you wanted to be taken seriously, you generally needed an arcade release.</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">What really caught my attention with this <em>Fight’n’Joke </em>re-release was the sincerity behind it. About five people worked on the original release, but despite that, it looks pretty good for a late DOS title and it features most of what you’d expect from a fighting game. Sure, it’s two-button (plus a charge button), but so were a lot of the NeoGeo Pocket fighting games like <em>SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium</em>. I’m not trying to say it’s great, it just punches above its weight class.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fight'N'Jokes - Steam Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ew7GTHGH4k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">There are 10 characters plus four that are unlockable and 11 stages. You can re-map the controls, so it works easily with an arcade stick. The name alone sets it up like it’s supposed to be funny, but it’s mostly just cartoonish like a newspaper comic strip. The press release actually describes it as “semi-humorous,” which would be about right.</p>
 <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">Mental Drink still features the same brothers who were behind Nasty Brothers Software, the creators of <em>Fight’n’Joke</em>. The re-release ports the game to a new engine that runs natively on modern operating systems. Along with online multiplayer, that’s not an easy job. It really speaks to how much affection they have for the little title. It was previously ported to Switch and Xbox One, but that version didn’t have online multiplayer. They’re planning to patch the console versions to bring them to parity with the PC version.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false"><em>Fight’n’Joke</em> is available now on PC. Although it’s listed as Early Access, the core game is complete. Mental Drink is just looking for feedback on the online performance.</p>

            <p>Fans of odd games with multiple endings and themes of identity and oppression, rejoice! Or, maybe, not rejoice. Time will tell. In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier/">Nier</a>, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">Gematsu</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nier-series-director-says-hes-doing-something-with-the-key-creatives-it-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier/">PCGamer</a>, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saito is at GPTRACK50 now, a new-ish studio under NetEase working on something new (last year <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/10/gptrack50-led-by-former-capcom-producer-hiroyuki-kobayashi-developing-new-3d-action-rpg">Gematsu reported</a> it's a 3D action RPG). It seems unlikely that rights holders Square Enix will release the Nier series - the most recent being 2017's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata/">Nier: Automata</a>, an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about the many ways robots can die - and Taro has <a href="https://x.com/yokotaro/status/1175865227948089344">said in the past</a> that any questions about Nier should be addressed to Squeenix. So my first instict would be to say that Saito is being a coy little flirt and they aren't really working on Nier. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E4%BD%95%E3%81%8B%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8">Taro re-Xeeted</a> the interview with the comment, "Something new...", so the needle is currently pointing at Who Knows? </p>
<p>Nier: Automata was a huge success and remains beloved, so any potential sequel news will be gratefully recieved by its many fans. Yoko Taro, meanwhile, remains one of my most favourite goofs to be allowed to be in charge of making huge games. I still think fondly of his promo for pre-ordering Nier: Automota to get a t-shirt, in which he rolls around on the floor saying, "Nier: Automata t-shirt!" and, "Shit Square Enix!", and which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhDL3Q86ofY">somehow released on official Squeenix channels</a>. He's currently a director on the Voice Of Cards RPG series, though Katharine was sadly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-review">not so keen on the first one</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-guns-we-might-see/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As one of the leading FPS franchises on the market, everyone eagerly awaits the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 6. But in the meantime, let’s explore what possible Black Ops 6 guns we might see in multiplayer. It’s always fun to plan a loadout ahead of time, right?!</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-guns-we-might-get">Black Ops 6 Guns We Might Get</h2>



<p>It’s important to note that nothing is 100% confirmed in Black Ops 6 yet. We’ll see a reveal soon enough, with details likely to come at the Xbox Games Showcase in June, however. For now, this is pure speculation based on the types and availability of weapons found during the Gulf War, which we know is the setting for the next Call of Duty game!</p>



<p>In no specific order, here are a few of the guns in Black Ops 6 we might see:</p>



<ul>
<li>AS VAL</li>



<li>VSS Vintorez</li>



<li>MP5</li>



<li>USP-45</li>



<li>Beretta M9</li>



<li>Makarov</li>



<li>M4</li>



<li>AR-10</li>



<li>M16A2</li>



<li>AK-74</li>



<li>SVD</li>



<li>KSP-58</li>



<li>M240</li>



<li>Mossberg 500</li>



<li>USAS-12</li>



<li>L85A1</li>



<li>AT4</li>



<li>M47 Dragon</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, word around town is that Black Ops 6 is an open-world game with vehicles to help you traverse the environment. While not directly guns, we’re likely to see various tanks, like the M1A1 Abrams, and mounted-machine guns on the back of a pick-up truck, as usual with the setting.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-guns">Black Ops 6 Zombies Guns</h2>



<p>Alongside the potentially massive selection of weapons in Black Ops 6 multiplayer mode, there’s also the Zombies game mode to consider. This year’s entry will supposedly include the return of two iconic Wonder Weapons, namely the <strong>Raygun </strong>and <strong>Jetgun</strong>!</p>



<p>Like many of you, I coveted the Raygun in World at War. But I didn’t have a chance to mess around with the Jetgun. I took a lengthy break from Call of Duty before its time, which was during Black Ops 2. I’m excited to get my hands on both this year, though!</p>

A turn-based RPG from the height of Squaresoft's dominance in the 1990s, it combined sci-fi and fantasy elements and a whole lot of mental illness troubles with giant mechs wailing on each other. It was pretty cool, and now you can bring a little part of that into your life with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV5PYHPB?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix's model kit of the Siebzehn</a>, one of the titular "Gears" of Xenogears.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-digs-deeper-in-june.872679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghost Ship Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Season 5 release date, and it's just a few weeks away.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/5993806139359858959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on Steam</a>, Season 5, otherwise known as Digging Deeper, will arrive on June 13th across all platforms, bringing with it a new mission type and more.</p>
<p>Said release date was actually technically revealed on Tuesday in the form of a series of numbers hidden in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/4194617370630456481" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a teaser image</a>, but the aforementioned post has made the release date explicit, so you don't have to guess at what those numbers might mean.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date-teaser.jpg?itok=mlaa1RDM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date-teaser.jpg?itok=exud53kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you spot the 06, 13, and 24 hidden in this image?</figcaption></figure><p>Back in late April, Ghost Ship revealed tons of information regarding exactly what's coming to Deep Rock Galactic in Season 5.</p>
<p>A new mission type, Deep Scan, is coming, tasking you and your crew with locating Morkite Seeds deep within Hoxxes and extracting with them before you get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to a mysterious new Season Event involving a "peculiar new mineral formation" known only as a Core Stone, although Ghost Ship is remaining relatively tight-lipped as to what these formations are.</p>
<p>New enemies and Overclocks will also be available as part of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Season 5, so you'll have plenty to look forward to when the season arrives.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-core-stone.jpg?itok=xZF2rR4W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-core-stone.jpg?itok=5X4B6qfj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is a Core Stone. What does it do? You'll have to wait to find out.</figcaption></figure><p>Remember, too, that you can now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-reactivation">access the content</a> from previous&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Seasons if you've missed out, so if you don't feel like starting Season 5 straight away, you won't have to.</p>
<p><em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>is a co-op shooter in which groups of dwarves delve deep into the planet of Hoxxes to mine it for minerals, complete objectives, and defend themselves against the hordes of insectoid enemies that await them.</p>
<p>The game features procedurally-generated maps, tons of loot to collect, and destructible environments, and it's also regularly being updated with new content.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deep-rock-galactic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deep-rock-galactic/9NHFVWX1V7QJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also available on Game Pass. Ghost Ship says it'll share more about Season 5 and what you can expect from it soon, so stay tuned.</p>

  <p id="B562Ak">When the revised 5th edition of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> becomes available on Sept. 17, the world will finally get a taste of the seminal role-playing game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23730399/dnd-dungeons-dragons-revised-core-rulebook-preview-players-handbook-dmg">upgraded mechanics</a>. But D&amp;D’s most dedicated fans will likely have a head start. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067481/dnd-dungeons-dragons-onednd-delay-2024-rules-refresh-players-handbook-dmg-release-date-price"><em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024)</a>, including a version with a special alternate art cover, hits brick-and-mortar shelves first on Sept. 3.</p>

<p id="SWwzU0">Illustrated by <a href="https://www.wyliebeckert.com/">Wylie Beckert</a>, the alt art cover of the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024)<em> </em>features a party comprised of D&amp;D’s four iconic classes — the fighter, the wizard, the cleric, and the rogue — all gathered around a friendly gold dragon, sharing tea. This gentle scene stands in stark contrast to the mainline <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), which<em> </em>will have a bright, bold cover by <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobsontyler/status/1790443483280584774">Tyler Jacobsen</a> with similar characters posed in the moments before striking a blow.</p>

<p id="vFoX24">“We liked the idea of making the alt cover something that has a sweeter, calmer version of that,” said Wizards’ head of art, Josh Herman, in a video interview with Polygon. “Something that’s not so aggressive, [with] combat [and] fighting right away. That’s certainly a [...] huge pillar of D&amp;D, but sometimes a lot of what D&amp;D is, is just storytelling.” </p>

<p id="KB0lfH">“I kind of wanted a coffee table book,” Herman continued, “but a book where I would sit and relax in that sort of <a href="https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/hygge">hygge</a> way, where you can relax and just cozy up and read something.”</p>

<p id="HTwf8U">Fans will likely recognize Beckert’s style from the alternate art cover of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/16/21569738/dungeons-dragons-tashas-cauldron-of-everything-review"><em>Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything</em></a>, which was released in 2020. The artist, who works in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3nSSOqrWf7/?hl=en">ink and watercolors as well as with oils and powdered graphite</a>, was Herman’s first choice for the project. He praised both the softness of her textures as well as the motion in her composition. You can see it first in the momentum of the smoke over Tasha’s cauldron, and in the movement of her arms. </p>
<p id="i5uETu">On the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), Beckert’s prowess and style are expressed through the sinewy curves of the dragon that surrounds the party, almost protectively, before terminating in a cheeky ampersand symbol with the end of its tail. A light source, centered on the dragon’s magical breath, also calls back subtly to the very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player%27s_Handbook"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a>, with art by David Trampier that featured a fire-lit golden idol with giant red gems for eyes.</p>
<p id="enctMP">“I think what that old cover does so well,” Herman said, “is it shows people on an adventure. It shows people doing a thing in the middle of an adventure. This is the contrast of that. This is almost your downtime [between adventures]. This is relaxing. We’re at camp, and I’m recovering my spell slots. I’m just relaxing and chilling.”</p>

</p>
<p id="pCU34N">Beckert’s art is only one piece of the final cover treatment. The alternate art on each of the three core rulebooks, including the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>(2024), and <em>Monster Manual </em>(2025),<em> </em>will also include a special gold filigree border designed by <a href="https://www.smeyerartist.com/">Simen Meyer</a>, a sign painter who created the alternate art covers for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22315969/dungeons-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23608660/dnd-dungeons-dragons-keys-golden-vault-best-heists"><em>Keys from the Golden Vault</em></a>. That, along with the 50th-anniversary logo on the back, should make these books stand out in any collection.</p>
<p id="IW8avx">“I genuinely love the idea that a local game store is the first place you can get your hands on something,” Herman said. “And I especially love it that you can do it with the alt cover, too.”</p>
<p id="Nb3KPe">The <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024) will be available for pre-order beginning June 18 before arriving at local game shops on Sept. 3. Fans should expect <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>(2024) a bit later on in November, with <em>Monster Manual (2025) </em>arriving in February next year. </p>

<p>LEGO and PlayStation are developing a new game named ‘LEGO Horizon Adventures’.</p>



<p>Last week, trademark finder <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurakasis tweeted</a> that Sony and Lego were soon to announce a collaboration of a well-known IP. At the time, Kurakasis revealed the game, but as what seems to be obligatory from insiders these days, I <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1789324181210796309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaguely tweeted</a> that the project was ‘on the horizon’.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, it was said that the game is essentially “Horizon Forbidden West but Lego” and that the game will have “realistic graphics” – whatever that means for a LEGO game.</p>



<p>While the exact details of the game are unclear, I got wind of an advertisement trailer for the game which was completed last month, which suggests that an announcement is on its way (although admittingly could be delayed). But combining this information with Kuraksis’ <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tweet</a>, who finds the majority of his information via trademark filings, it suggests that the trademark has recently been registered (brownie points to anyone who finds it), backing up that an announcement could be soon.</p>



<p>Exact details on when the game will be announced are unclear, but recent rumors of a PlayStation Showcase in the coming weeks align nicely with what is happening with this game (trademarks, ad trailers, etc.). </p>



<p>What do you think of a LEGO Horizon Adventures game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

But it now seems clear Activison has decided on Black Ops 6, which makes sense given Call of Duty 2024 is the sixth main Black Ops game, but that does also mean we’re skipping Black Ops 5 (2020's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> looks set to be considered Black Ops 5 in the run).</p><p>Reports from last year indicated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fresh-call-of-duty-2024-details-confirmed-alongside-gulf-war-setting-in-new-report">Black Ops 6 will take place during the Gulf War</a>, additionally touching on the global political fallout after the Cold War.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/owlchemy-vision-pro-is-biggest-step-towards-vr-mainstream-adoption<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>We talk to the exec team about virtual reality's latest developments, and why hype cycles are making the journey to mainstream seem longer than it is</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Rumour has it that the Vision Pro is finally getting ready to get shipped outside of the US. Three months after its American launch, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/apple-set-to-sell-vision-pro-headset-internationally-for-first-time">Bloomberg</a> reported that Apple's VR headset could be shipping in several territories worldwide as early as next month, off the back of the firm's Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many headsets Apple has shifted since retail availability in the US but the high $3,500 price point has made the Vision Pro somewhat of a niche within a niche product. Global availability could heighten the demand though.</p>
<p>And that's good news for the developers who are supporting the Vision Pro, including Owlchemy Labs. The studio announced back in February that it was porting VR hits Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator to Apple's headset, and CEO Andrew Eiche says that the strategy has always been for the studio's games to be on as many platforms as possible, regardless of how big the platforms are.</p>
<p>"Owlchemy has always been a multi-platform studio even back to the days when we were doing mobile games," he tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. "And so it's less about a niche within a niche and more about the future. I think a lot of what Vision Pro represents, and a lot of what people care about, is they're hearing that this headset has reinvigorated the popularity of XR. I gave a webinar with Unity [about Vision Pro] and it was the most popular webinar they had ever done.</p>
<p>"And so, for us, this particular one is less about 'Oh, we need to be on the most popular headset.' It's more about what is good for the ecosystem. Our games are staples of VR and we love for the people who are just jumping into VR to play our games."</p>
<p>We ask Eiche whether he sees the Vision Pro as a viable platform for the mainstream, or whether he believes that's not the goal here.</p>
<blockquote>"This is less about 'we need to be on the most popular headset', [and] more about what is good for the ecosystem"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>"No," he answers. "I see it as one of the biggest steps towards mainstream adoption. I think there's still a lot of things that we have to figure out to get there. But as far as friction [goes], which is one of the biggest things that we fight in XR... It's one of the lowest friction devices. You put it on, there's no room setup, it's not yelling at you to draw circles or whatever, it just runs the apps. There's no caveats to it.</p>
<p>"And I think that, thinking strategically, that's really important to have a headset that you could just put on, it auto adjusts the lenses, it logs you in, it does everything."</p>
<p>The Vision Pro works with hand tracking, so not having to use controllers is also a strong selling point, he says, adding: "I think it represents the biggest step towards changing VR from a specific use case to a general computing use case."</p>
<p>Sandra Marshall, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jobs-roundup-january-2024-hutch-appoints-peter-hansen-chambers-as-co-ceo#:~:text=Sandra%20Marshall%20%7C%20COO%2C%20Owlchemy%20Labs">newly appointed COO of Owlchemy</a>, is in agreement that reducing friction as much as possible is the key, and that Vision Pro is a good example of that.</p>
<p>"It's in an ecosystem or a platform that people are used to, so if you already have the phone or the watch or whatnot, it's an extension of that, from a UI perspective, to get in and get it set up," she points out.</p>

<p>It feels like every new headset is expected to become <em>the</em> VR headset that will reach mainstream adoption. Back in 2013, <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> contributing editor Rob Fahey was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-the-vr-dream-go-mainstream">pondering whether or not the 'VR dream' could go mainstream</a>. And a decade later, it feels like the same questions are still unanswered, with the very same Rob Fahey arguing in 2023 that VR <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vr-isnt-ready-for-a-must-play-experience-opinion">still isn't ready to play host to the cultural phenomenon that a 'must-play' experience would provide</a>.</p>
<p>We ask the Owlchemy team what they think is missing, and how much longer the journey is going to take.</p>
<p>"I think the thing is that we were spoiled with smartphones," Eiche says. "And we forgot that smartphones had to go through Blackberry, they had to go through Palm… We had to go through all this stuff, and what we remember is Apple showed up and released this magical square that thinks and does everything for you. And you forget that Apple also made the Newton, which was a handheld device way back when, and famously was not successful.</p>
<p>"And I think a lot of what you get with enthusiasm is this kind of short look at things, but what has to happen first is the friction has to go down and we're still not there."</p>
<blockquote>"We need the usefulness of it to rise and there will be an inflection point [when] the device becomes useful enough that the friction is worth it"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>Even the best VR headsets feel heavy after a while, or get hot, he points out. And loving VR still sometimes feels like you have to justify yourself because people don't quite get the point.</p>
<p>"We need the usefulness of it to rise and there will be an inflection point," Eiche continues. "And it's going to be the inflection point of when the device becomes useful enough that the friction is worth it.</p>
<p>"For many of us it's there, but it's not there for the mainstream yet. But we're starting to see chipping away at that broader problem. So, I think, as developers and enthusiasts, you always want your eye on mainstream adoption but we need to be less worried about 'Are we there yet?' and more worried about 'Are we on a path to get there?'</p>
<p>"Sometimes technology appears and it's super useful, and you understand. Like Chat GPT shows up one day and everyone just f***ing gets it. But what you forget is that AI started in the '70s, and the first neural network proposal that [eventually] became Chat GPT, that started then, and we're just so used to not watching technology evolve, because it happens behind [the scenes] and then it gets productised and sent out as this great thing... And I think VR is one of the few cases where we've been so openly involved in watching every single step that we're like, 'But I love it, it should be here now!' And it's like… just wait!"</p>

<p>We mention some of the misconceptions VR has to fight, which are not dissimilar to some stigma associated with 2D-screen games at their debut; like the idea that VR is inherently isolating, as opposed to something that can be enjoyed as a group in the same room. (I'll personally always recommend to whoever says that to spend an evening with some friends and Beat Saber. Or Home Improvisation.)</p>
<p>Owlchemy product director Matthew Hemby comments: "Some of that is just also... it takes time. I remember getting my first iPhone and feeling like an absolute a**hole anytime I'd take it out in public. And so to Andrew's point about the tipping point of utility and friction... Some of this is also just us getting comfortable interfacing regularly with new technology around other people."</p>
<p>Marshall argues that people feeling like they're playing together when they're not physically in the same space is something a 2D screen can't give you.</p>
<p>"And I think having more multiplayer games will enable people that have these shared experiences together in a way that you can't get on other platforms," she adds. "The introduction of more mixed reality, as a way to see the environment around you as you have others with you, also contributes to that."</p>
<p>Owlchemy has been working on a multiplayer project that uses hand-tracking, which was announced at Gamescom 2022. So it certainly hopes to continue contributing to the march to mainstream adoption.</p>
<blockquote>"We need to be less worried about 'Are we there yet?' and more worried about 'Are we on a path to get there?'"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>The mention of Chat GPT earlier in the conversation leads us to discuss the ebbs and flows of hype cycles, which is currently all about AI but was about VR still not that long ago. And Eiche sees the trend going the same way it did for VR: "You just crash against the wall."</p>
<p>He continues: "Remember, VR was called the empathy machine, it was going to solve all of our problems… We're just at the top of the hype curve here, and a lot of that gets driven by where people want to invest, and very fancy demos. And my opinion [about AI] has always been that I'm very positive on it, but I'm positive on a very boring version of it.</p>
<p>"The ultimate end state of it is not that everybody suddenly has a [machine] over their shoulder just chatting with them all day. The ultimate end state is that you're going to buy an AI as a service package to integrate into your enterprise deployment and some companies are going to offer you that… It's very, very boring. But it's extremely useful.</p>
<p>"But right now, we're in the weird stage where people are over-applying. So, it's a buzzword the way that VR was. And it's funny because the group of people who chase the buzzwords, you always see them; they were in VR, they left VR for crypto, crypto was trash, they went to AI, it turns out AI is actually really hard to make, now Vision's [here] so they're back, and we see them again... And it's this cyclical group, and you're never gonna fix that, you just need to wait for the next buzzword. And then the people who are going to actually build it will stay and they'll work really hard."</p>

The project became a record-breaker after amassing over 3.2 million wishlists on Steam (a platform record) and topped 1 million sales within 24 hours of its early access debut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hooded Horse co-founder and CEO Tim Bender said the title has exceeded the company's wildest expectations. "It's been wonderful to see so many players give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a try," said Bender. "We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so quickly has exceeded even those."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">recent interview with Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Bender explained Hooded Horse began to suspect </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might do well after a Steam Next Fest demo generated around 500,000 wishlists during the event. Another 800,000 wishlists arrived in the two weeks prior to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> early access launch thanks to an upswing in press and influencer coverage, but still Bender refused to get carried away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As much as I'd like to say 'I saw it coming.' Anybody would have to be absolutely arrogant to expect that. It gained a higher launch peak [player count] than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Total War: Warhammer III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If I expected that I would have been insane. I was hoping for half of that," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of May 11, which is when we spoke with Bender, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a lifetime wishlist conversion rate of 26 percent. Bender clarified that percentage was different on launch day because more players have wishlisted the title since, but it's a metric that's indicative of the title's colossal success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The great thing is, you'd think because we launched with little over 3 million wishlists, that would mean we now have less than 3 million wishlists. But the wishlists have been increasing with the sales, so we still have over 3 million," added Bender. "It has basically built wishlists back up as quickly as it's converted them, so it's going to have a long future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Bender, fostering longevity is about encouraging players to hop aboard when the time is right–even if that means waiting for future discounts or the full launch. "I did the thing in business school they tell you not to do, but I told players more discounts are coming," he said. "But we don't mind [customers] waiting. We don't want them to experience regret."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Bender, including his thoughts on the use of "fundamentally stupid" recoup clauses in publishing deals, by checking out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">another excerpt from our interview</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-monopoly-go-partner-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> latest Partners event</a>, Robo Partners, is here for the next five days. During this event, you’ll pair up with up to three other players and collect points to build a robot. As you reach certain milestones, you’ll receive rewards, ranging from a few hundred dice to a Wild Sticker and exclusive token. </p> <h2 id="h-all-monopoly-go-robo-partners-event-rewards-and-milestones" data-injectable="false">All <em>Monopoly GO</em> Robo Partners event rewards and milestones</h2> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">From now until May 21, <em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Robo Partners event allows you to win five milestone rewards with each partner and a final grand prize after completing all four robots. While the first tier gives you 200 dice per partner, they scale quickly, with the last milestone providing over 400 dice and a four-star sticker pack. Below is a complete list of every Robo Partners event reward. </p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Event Milestone</th><th data-align="center">Points Needed</th><th data-align="center">Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">2,500</td><td data-align="center">200 Dice</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">2</td><td data-align="center">8,500</td><td data-align="center">Cash</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">3</td><td data-align="center">21,500</td><td data-align="center">Cash<br>200-300 Dice<br>Cash Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">48,000</td><td data-align="center">300-500 Dice<br>Three-Star Sticker Pack<br>High Roller</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">5</td><td data-align="center">80,000</td><td data-align="center">Cash<br>400-600 Dice<br>Four-Star Sticker Pack<br>15 minutes of Cash Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grand Prize</td><td data-align="center">320,000<br>(All four spots complete)</td><td data-align="center">5,000 Dice<br>Robo Penguin token<br>Wild Sticker</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Since you can receive each prize up to four times, you can get a minimum of 9,400 dice, eight sticker packs, and one Wild Sticker if you complete the entire event, making participating worthwhile if you have friends or family that actively play&nbsp;<em>Monopoly GO.</em></p> <h2 id="h-how-to-find-partners-for-the-robo-partners-event" data-injectable="false">How to find partners for the Robo Partners event</h2> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Finding partners during<em> Monopoly GO’s</em> Robo Partners event requires heading into the event’s menu, picking one of your empty spots, and inviting someone to join. If someone has already asked you, you’ll find options to accept or decline their offer. Otherwise, you’ll find your list of friends here, whom you can invite and await their response.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Alternatively, you can invite random players to join through this menu. However, there is a chance they won’t participate at all, so be careful with who you ask to join you in the event. You also can’t remove partners once they accept your invite, so your choices are final.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-during-the-robo-partners-event" data-injectable="false">How to score points during the Robo Partners event</h2> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">Scoring points during Robo Partners requires collecting event tokens and spinning your Partner spot points wheel. As you gain tokens, you can select one of your Partner event robots to find your and your partner’s current points alongside a points wheel. You’ll gain a random number of points by spinning this wheel, contributing to your milestone progression. You can also change your multiplier to earn more points&nbsp;by&nbsp;using more tokens per spin.</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">To gain more tokens for the Robo Partners points wheel, you must participate in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-safari-sprint-tournament-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tournaments and banner events</a>, finish your daily quick wins, and redeem shop gifts. Over time, you’ll gain hundreds, potentially thousands, of tokens to use during the Partners event, allowing you to claim its milestone and snowball your progress.</p>

<p>Despite a notice on the PlayStation Store that said an internet connection would also be required to play the game, Ubisoft has confirmed <em>this</em> is not true, and the entire game can be played offline. </p><p>Nowadays, Ubisoft requires an online connection to install its recent games.

            <p>
It looks like PS2 game Star Wars: The Clone Wars will join PS Plus next month.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by PlayStation Store price tracker <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars">PS Deals</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store">Gematsu</a>), the game will release on 11th June and will likely be part of the next wave of classics available to Premium subscribers.

</p>
<p>
This version of the game will include new modern features, including up-rendering, rewind and quick save functions, and custom video filters.

Reads the store listing description: "This title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles and provides newly added features. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation 2 version, or where some features may cause the title to not function properly. This version does not support the PlayStation 2 console's peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available."
</p>
<p>
It will also feature offline multiplayer for two players.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: The Clone Wars released on PS2 in Europe in 2003, alongside similar releases on GameCube and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts, it's set during the prequel era and has players controlling both vehicles and popular heroes for its single-player campaign. Multiplayer included four player splitscreen, plus an online mode for the Xbox version.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-headlines-playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-may">Sony revealed the next wave of games hitting the PS Plus subscription next week</a>, including Red Dead Redemption 2.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition will leave the service on 21st May</a>, leading to speculation a PS5 version could be on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandbox survival adventure&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, with the game's 1.0 update and console version emerging from the caves in summer.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4175476431591562550" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the top-down pixel-art survive-'em-up is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 27th, which is also when the 1.0 update will arrive for PC.</p>
<p>If you're one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-500k-in-two-weeks">hundreds of thousands of people</a> who picked the game up during its Early Access period, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s 1.0 update will feature major changes to the game's content and features, and it'll also bring a ton of quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-release-date-1.0-treasure-chests.jpg?itok=nusULWp5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-release-date-1.0-treasure-chests.jpg?itok=7me7PGHc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is finally emerging from Early Access this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's actually coming as part of that 1.0 update, developer Pugstorm is remaining tight-lipped for now. The studio says it's got "something cool" planned for the full&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>release, though, and that more information is coming soon.</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper</em>'s Summer update, which was scheduled to launch...well, sometime in summer, will now take the form of a performance and bug fix-focused patch rather than bringing any new content with it.</p>
<p>However, the content that was originally planned for the Summer update will now arrive as part of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0, so you're not missing out on any extra fun.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s full PC and console release right here. If you've never encountered&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>before, it'll give you a good sense of what kind of game you're in for.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is a survival sandbox game in which you (and, optionally, up to seven friends) explore a massive procedurally-generated cave complex, mining and crafting (ahem) your way towards unraveling the mystery of the titular Core.</p>
<p>The game was originally released in Early Access back in March 2022, racking up 100,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days">within its first two days on release</a>&nbsp;and breaking the 250,000 barrier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-250k-within-week">within a week</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out Pugstorm's full vision for&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>When they’re not banding together <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">to take on Sony</a> or attempting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disgruntled-helldivers-2-fans-start-petition-to-bring-back-fired-community-manager">reinstate fired community managers</a>, it turns out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players just want to make sure everyone feels included. Included in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op game</a>’s endless war of attrition to protect Super Earth from bugs, robots, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">basic awareness of military propaganda</a>, and included in just having mates. Enter player ‘dremskiy’, whose tragic booting from a private game in which they just wanted to make friends has resulted in so many friend requests that their Steam account won’t accept any more.</p>

<p>This is a story best introduced through the Reddit post that originally chronicled it, so here’s the inciting incident:</p>


<p>Whether through comedic timing or just an earnest desire to buddy up, the post struck a chord with fellow ‘divers, who bestowed upon dremskiy the monkey’s paw previously reserved for the likes of Keanu Reeves or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/let-me-solo-her-has-completed-a-stunning-malenia-only-elden-ring-run">Let Me Solo Her</a> - temporary Reddit deification. Soon, dreamskiy had so many friend requests that Steam got jealous and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cshou1/dremskiy_have_frends/">put a halt to them</a>.</p>
<p>If this is all a bit too UWU wholesome for your tastes, then never fear. There is a sardonic lining to this candyfloss cloud, you fonts of perpetual misery. It didn’t take long for the official Helldivers 2 Xitter account to get in on the meme. We love a terminally online brand rep. However, when Playstation UK’s account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csmqzi/not_you_lol/%22%3Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csmqzi/not_you_lol/">tried to join in the fun</a>, they were soon heartily ratio’d, as is the custom of our times.</p>
<p>This might have something to do with the fact that, despite earlier promises, Sony have started quietly <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789049418404229409">locking out </a>certain countries without PSN account access from playing the game they’ve already purchased on Steam. <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789337531517219154">This Helldivers 2 news account</a> has a handy map of affected locations, including the majority of Africa. My sources tell me this is some bullshit, a take I have corroborated with myself. Let's hope a better solution is found sharpish, before players start teaming up to change international laws or something. </p>

					</p></div><div>

					<p>The late 90s were a great time for video games as a whole. Instead of focusing on certain franchises that were sure to sell well, developers worldwide were constantly attempting to innovate established genres. Squaresoft, now Square Enix, was among the Japanese developers more willing to experiment, dipping their toes in many different genres, including the fighting games genre, with series like Tobal and Bushido Blade. The latter, despite only being comprised of two entries, is still well-regarded today for having managed to create an experience centered around 1-hit-kill mechanics that worked surprisingly well, and very few games managed to replicate properly.</p>
<p>Die by the Blade by Grindstone is only the latest fighting game that attempts to become a modern-day Bushido Blade. Unfortunately, the long development time wasn't enough to make it a game worth playing for fans of the series, as its decent core mechanics are marred by the subpar execution of everything that surrounds them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240514124106_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike most modern fighting games that attempt to draw the player in with elaborate story modes, Die by the Blade doesn't even feature a semblance of one. There's little to no information on the bland roster of characters, and what little there is, found in the Characters menu, doesn't say much about the samurai punk world they inhabit. From what can be gleaned from the brief descriptions available, a mega-corporation called Praxis is about doing all sorts of shady business which involves the main characters, whose names like Yoshi, Daisuke, Ronin, and Butterfly are as appealing as their design, but this is not elaborated in any way in the game.</p>
<p>While this is usually not a major issue for a fighting game, it most definitely is Die by the Blade. Getting players invested in the characters and their stories is what brought fans into Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Soul Calibur, Guilty Gear, and even Bushido Blade itself, whose story was among the highlights of the experience. The lack of such, in conjunction with the aforementioned bland character design, doesn't really work in the game's favor. There's simply no reason to care about these individuals, and this hurts the experience immensely.</p>
<p>The fact that the characters essentially all play the same doesn't help either. In Die by the Blade, the weapon dictates the moveset, as the characters only have some light differences in stats. Yoshi, for example, is the most balanced character, while Butterfly sacrifices Resolve, a stat that indicates stamina, for Speed. The combination of the seven characters and five weapons (Katana, Chokuto, Nodachi, Wakizashi, and Naginata) should provide players with plenty of options, but in reality, the differences between characters are minimal, and they do not matter as much as the weapons of choice do.</p>
<p>No matter the selected character and weapon, Die by the Blade plays unlike most fighting games on the market. Inside smallish 3D arenas, two players confront one another using their weapons, and the first one to get hit dies. Matches do not have a timer in most modes outside Challenges, so rounds could last very long if none of the players make any mistakes.</p>
<p>Being a 1-hit-kill experience, offense and defense work differently from most modern fighting games, centered on a stance system controlled with the right stick. Depending on the stance, it is possible to block the opponent's attack automatically if the stances match and unleash different vertical and horizontal attacks as well as Sequences, combo strings that can pressure the opponent heavily. Defensive options also include a parry, which allows the character to block any attack in a short time window after activation, regardless of the chosen stance, rolling, and sidestepping. Each of these techniques is effective in avoiding certain types of attacks, so mastering all of them is extremely important to win matches. Each must also be used judiciously, as it is not only dangerous due to this rock-paper-scissor system but also impossible due to the aforementioned Resolve system. This stamina gauge gets depleted by performing any combat action, and once depleted, attacks become slow, and it is impossible to auto-parry attacks. Hence, keeping it up is just as important as keeping an eye on the opponent.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240514123941_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the clunky movement, animations, and slight input delay are difficult not to notice, I must admit that the Die by the Blade core mechanics hold decent potential. With some choice tweaking, they could easily become noteworthy. Once a round gets going, the tense exchange of attacks is definitely exhilarating, especially after the Stance mechanics are fully understood, and the gruesome Finishers unleashed after certain Sequences are performed contribute to making the game feel like a true duel to the death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as mentioned, these core mechanics are marred by the subpar execution of everything surrounding them. The biggest offender, in my opinion, is the camera. Not only is the angle not very good for proper positioning, but it rotates for no reason every time an attack is parried. There are plenty of good reasons why the camera is consistent in fighting games, but Grindstone went for a cinematic approach that doesn't work well. The game also lacks visual clarity due to the sparks produced by parrying and blocking, so, in conjunction with the camera, it sometimes is difficult to understand what is going on, a critical issue in a 1-hit-kill game. Clarity issues are further compounded by certain arenas, like the dojo, which have some visibility and lighting issues.</p>
<p>Die by the Blade also leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to content. Alongside the extremely limited number of characters and movesets, the game features only a few play modes that do not even cover the essentials. Offline modes include a Versus and Tournament Mode, and single-player modes are limited to a Tutorial Mode, a Practice Mode that lacks important features like the ability to pin Sequences input on screen to practice them, and a Challenges mode, a basic survival mode that pits the player against a sequence of generic grunts for no reward other than Player Experience and Coins. These two currencies are part of the atrocious system used by Die by the Blade to unlock additional content, such as characters, weapons, customization options, and even play modes.</p>
<p>What makes this system horrible, besides the fact that it locks essential content like characters and weapons behind an arbitrary progression system reminiscent of free-to-play games, is the small amount of XP handed out - 50 points per victory, 5 per defeat. As such, it can take well over two hours to unlock everything, which is a very long time for a game without compelling play mode. The system seems to have been thought out to pad the game out and attempt to hide the fact that it offers very little.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240507130013_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Online modes in Die by the Blade don't fare much better. Unfortunately, I couldn't test out the netcode due to the low online population during the review period, and I will update this part of the review accordingly once the game is out. Still, even if it was the best implementation of rollback netcode around, it wouldn't really change the fact that the mode selection is just as limited as the offline one. Besides Ranked Matches and Ranked Tournaments, the game only offers a friendly match mode that requires the host player to invite another player. The lack of casual matchmaking feels like a major oversight, although I feel it may have been a conscious choice from the developer not to disperse its player base among different matchmaking pools. Even after it launches on consoles later this year, I feel Die by the Blade will become one of those niche Discord fighting games that only get to be played by a small community.</p>
<p>Die by the Blade also disappoints in regards to visuals and performance. Simply put, the character models look undetailed, are stiffly animated, and have no visual flair that distinguishes them. Same for the environments. They are the blandest take on the "samurai punk" theme that powers the experience, and they have nothing remarkable going on for them. They are empty and feel completely lifeless. With such underwhelming visuals, seeing how even performance wasn't good was baffling. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at an average of 116 FPS during a benchmark session in the Challenges mode with DLSS Quality and maximum settings. While the average framerate was high, frame times were all over the place, with evident stuttering before the match began and during Finishers. The 32 1% low recorded during the benchmark session tells everything there is to say regarding the smoothness of the experience.</p>

<p>Despite some decent core mechanics, Die by the Blade seems to lack a solid vision, featuring design choices suggesting both competitive and casual, single-player approaches that are not realized in the slightest. As such, it is very difficult to recommend the game to anyone in its current state, especially to the Bushido Blade fans who have waited so long for a spiritual successor worthy of its name.</p>
<p><em>Review code provided by the publisher.</em></p>

					
					

<p>Solid core mechanics are not enough to make Die by the Blade the compelling spiritual sequel of the Bushido Blade series fans have been waiting for a long time. Bland character design, clunky animations, horrendously slow progression system, extreme lack of content and mediocre visuals are only some of the issues that mar an experience that is very difficult to recommend to anyone in its current state.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In all likelihood, you saw the headline of this review or scrolled down to check out the score before coming to read this here introduction. If that's the case, let me tell you: yes, <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em> is not a good game. But I must also emphasize this is of no fault to <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios">Nightdive Studios</a>, the excellent developer that ported this confusing mess of a "game."</p>
<p>If you're like me, you never knew it existed until <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive">Nightdive announced its remaster</a> on April 1st of this year. A fitting date to announce this incredibly frustrating and bizarre game, but at the same time, I'm glad to have played it. Originally released in 1995 on the 3DO, this obscure retro shooter narrowly avoids its fate of falling into obscurity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-platforming.jpg?itok=TjiCzPzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-platforming.jpg?itok=cTiYL2fE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They had a vision for this game, and I still don't know what it was.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Confusing World that is <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em></h2>
<p>When <em>Po'ed</em> was released, it was still during the frontier period of FPS development: <em>Wolfenstein </em>led to <em>Doom</em>, which led to a boom of pioneers testing the limits of what the first-person shooter genre could achieve. In came <em>Heretic </em>and entries for juggernaut franchises like <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>. And then there was <em>Po'ed</em>.</p>
<p><em>Po'ed </em>is a confusing mess of a game, marred with issues ranging from its movement and level design, all the way down to levels that look unfinished or haphazardly put together. Its arsenal of weapons is a bit more unique than other FPS games and certainly, the enemy design stays with you. But it is generally unpleasant to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=hEz03ytA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=S4p1__0c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chess? Well, that's a choice to have in your level.</figcaption></figure><p>Levels start out easy enough -- just make it to the end teleporter to move on to the next area. It is most certainly <em>not</em> a corridor shooter. <em>Po'ed</em> favors wide open spaces, some of which are shockingly large for a game of its era. It <em>is</em> actually impressive to see this, even though most of this wide open space feels like bloat.</p>
<p>For most of the campaign, you're equipped with a jetpack to help navigate these spaces while shooting at foes all the while. The jetpack's pretty darn fun to use and, once you get the hang of the controls, is pretty smooth. The downside to using the jetpack is you might end up motion sick, and no, I'm not talking about in the game.</p>
<p>The way the jetpack lurches around actually made me nauseous, and I went through extensive testing to come to this conclusion. The way the jetpack lurches the camera around can be a bit jarring, so keep that in mind and perhaps adjust the FOV if you run into this issue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-level-design.jpg?itok=8yYFFfV5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-level-design.jpg?itok=GKYkuKeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hope you have jetpack fuel for this one.</figcaption></figure><p>If I had to describe <em>Po'</em><em>ed</em>'s level design in one word, it would be "experimental." Everything has this slapdash look to it, with floating platforms and environments placed with no rhyme nor reason. This leads to some truly confusing moments, and you get lost. It seemed nigh unable to find what I needed to to do proceed, and this strange level design exacerbated this.</p>
<p>To proceed, it would often end up that you'd need to kill a certain amount of enemies or hit switches hidden in such absurd locations. It seemed almost impossible to proceed without consulting a guide, which someone had thankfully made years prior. I don't mind exploring, but it's frustrating when the solution to move forward is so absurdly vague.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-laser-gun_0.jpg?itok=pI-Em3HG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-laser-gun_0.jpg?itok=fWf2Fb-N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This gun was actually fun to use but ate up a lot of ammo.</figcaption></figure><h2>Butt-Aliens and More -- Welcome to the <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em> Experience</h2>
<p>So yes, <em>Po'</em><em>ed</em> has these puzzle elements in its level design, but it's also an FPS, so there are plenty of enemies and shooting. You have an eclectic cast of enemies like butt-aliens that shoot foul projectiles, retro robots, and other strange beasts.</p>
<p>The most annoying of the bunch are these flying enemies that are so difficult to hit, especially when you consider<em> </em>your shots auto-target enemies. With dozens of little floaty bastards zooming to and fro, contending with auto-targeting is the last thing I want to deal with.</p>
<p>When you're not zipping around on a jetpack blasting away at enemies, you can wrestle with two wonderful movement options. I like to call them "sluggish and slippery," since the base walk just isn't fast enough and the sprint makes it feel as though you're running on ice -- this makes for some rather frustrating gunplay, especially if you try to platform around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-pistol.jpg?itok=oW43kS4u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-pistol.jpg?itok=kVturmaO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the classic starting pistol for <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em>. It's fine, I guess.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the cast of weapons is at least adequate. You have a range of alien-like energy weapons, a frying pan and drill for melee, a flamethrower, and a few more. It's nothing crazy, but these weapons get the job done, sound pretty cool, and nothing feels underpowered. I didn't like using the flamethrower, though, since it shared fuel with the jetpack.</p>
<p><em>Po'ed</em> got a generous helping of touch-ups to make it accessible and playable on PC at 144 FPS. It runs flawlessly, to Nightdive's credit. The biggest thing going for <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em> is that Nightdive did the amazing work of bringing it over to their proprietary engine. This includes visual enhancements.</p>
<p>Said visual enhancements only go so far with <em>Po'ed</em>, though, as the overall art direction is ugly. Repeated, drab textures and a lack of visual cohesiveness are rampant in <em>Po'ed</em>. I applaud Nightdive's efforts in creating a more legible game, but you can only do so much when the original product itself wasn't all that appealing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-rtx.jpg?itok=OMTro_Xf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-rtx.jpg?itok=zfpqC3dh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kudos to Nightdive for doing what they could to enhance this game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Po'ed: Definitive Edition Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Anything <em>Po'ed</em> does, just about any other FPS does better. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a> came out a year before and its level design is far more advanced, and visually much more appealing; <em>Hexen</em>, out the same year as <em>Po'ed</em>, managed to create an awesome fantasy atmosphere and keep levels looking fresh. <em>Po'ed</em> does none of that.</p>
<p>Nightdive could have easily let <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition </em>live in near obscurity, but I appreciate their gumption in porting a very strange game that isn't nearly as fun as its predecessors. Though I may be harsh on<em>&nbsp;</em>this title, sometimes it's fun to check out the weirder side of gaming, and <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition </em>matches that criteria.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Po'ed: Definitive Edition </strong>was reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher over roughly 5 hours of gameplay. All screenshots in this review were taken by the reviewer during gameplay. </em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
It's commendable work by Nightdive to port this obscure title, but it's no wonder they announced its existence on April Fool's Day. Po'ed: Definitive Edition is a confusing mess of a game to play, but it does leave a lasting impression. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p data-characters="431" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s meta-narrative has constantly kept players on their toes since everyone’s contributions to missions has a tangible effect on how the Galactic War plays out, with it entirely possible to fail the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-track-major-orders-and-war-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Major Orders</a> and lose control of planets. But perhaps the biggest shake-up is the community’s recent failure, which has triggered what developer Arrowhead Game Studios is calling the Second Galactic War.</p> <p data-characters="615" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">For context, players were tasked with killing two billion Automatons in five days, but only managed to reach 78% of the goal. An in-game update and a post to the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord (which has since been shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csoqe8/the_second_galactic_war_has_begin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>) states, “The war now escalates into what is officially called The Second Galactic War,” adding that everything up until this point was only part of an “elaborate special operation.” There is something quietly terrifying about all the chaos, destruction, and death so far as being but a prelude, though that also makes <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s future all the more exciting.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">This failure also means players won’t be unlocking a new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-stratagem-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagem</a>, but Arrowhead says it will “elude the Helldiver arsenal for now,” suggesting there’ll be another way to obtain it later down the line. Perhaps the most intriguing detail is that players are expected to protect training facilities full of new recruits. Some players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csnxll/it_was_all_just_a_special_military_operations/?sort=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> suspect this is leading up to an actual in-game mechanic, such as a Stratagem that lets you summon NPC allies to help you in battle. I’ve also seen it suggested that the new recruits in question are actually meant to be new players via a free trial or an Xbox port.</p>
 <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">An Xbox port sounds like wishful thinking considering <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a Sony published game. There has been a demand for it, though, and Microsoft has shown a willingness to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-confirms-which-four-xbox-games-are-heading-to-new-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">port some of its exclusives to PlayStation</a>. Sony’s general manager Sadahiko Hayakawa did also comment on the importance of improving player engagement during an earnings call (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693040-sony-group-corporation-sony-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Seeking Alpha</a>): “By steadily maintaining and expanding the consistently increased number of active users and user engagement while also strengthening control over business costs, we believe that we will be able to steadily increase sales and profits on the PS platform going forward.”</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Bringing a game as popular as <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox would certainly improve player engagement, though whether Sony is genuinely considering putting one of its biggest successes on a rival platform is something only the company knows.</p>

Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Danny DeVito has been asked whether he'd take on the role of Wario in a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, after having been suggested for the role by Luigi voice actor Charlie Day and Mario performer Chris Pratt.
</p>
<p>
Day, who co-stars with DeVito in Always Sunny in Philadelphia, previously told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amXv_9pg3SM">Digital Spy</a> he wanted the actor to take on the role of Mario's moustache-twirling, nose-picking nemesis in a future film. 
</p>
<p>
Now, DeVito has been asked whether he'd accept the offer and, seemingly unwittingly, has replied with the perfect money-grabbing Wario response.

<p>
"I'm going to take them to the cleaners," DeVito told YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAn3Q61q8Io">TheMovieDweeb</a> - which sounds pretty similar to something the loot-loving Wario would say. "But I should be in the movie."
</p>
<p>
"You never know what happens in the world," DeVito said when asked about taking on the Wario role in future. "I'm up for a lot of things. I'm up for - I'm ready to do a lot of things. Whatever's coming, I look at, I see, I evaluate."
</p>
<p>
Will we see Wario make his big screen debut in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-2026">next Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, set to arrive in cinemas in 2026? </p>
<p>Nintendo is, so far, keeping the plot and main characters of the next Mario movie under-wraps, though we've already donned our plumber's thinking cap and overalls to speculate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">where the Super Mario Bros. series might go next</a>.

            <p>Absurd Ventures, the company started by Rockstar Games co-founder and head writer Dan Houser after he left said juggernaut, are working on a new "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> action-adventure" game. That's according to recent job listings on Absurd's website (cheers <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-lead-dan-houser-is-making-an-open-world-action-adventure-game-of-his-own-at-his-new-studio/">Gamesradar</a> for the spot), which mention such a thing. And to be honest, are any of us surprised? Not really. Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last year, Absurd Ventures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-co-founder-and-gta-writer-dan-houser-founds-new-company-absurd-ventures">said</a> they'd, "create a new IP across all platforms and for all formats", with a focus on storytelling. On top of that, they said they'd produce "narrative worlds" in the form of other things like books, graphic novels, and podcasts.</p>
<p>Later, a couple of those worlds would be <a href="https://x.com/AbsurdVentures/status/1729909061683155364">unveiled</a> as American Caper and A Better Paradise, American Caper being a graphic novel and A Better Paradise an audio drama, but both likely to spin off into other forms in the future.</p>
<p>All of this is to say, Absurd Ventures now have a bunch of roles going on their <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers#4366082007">site</a> and some of them give a glimpse into the game they're working on. The Lead Gameplay Designer vacancy mentions an open world action-adventure game, but also someone to help develop "best-in-class combat" and "third person action across multiple game modes". There's also mention in this listing of someone with knowledge of "melee and shooting mechanics", as well as "driving, mounts, climbing, traversal, platforming, etc."</p>
<p>A look at some of the other roles on offer, like Senior Art Director, don't really give anything away. It's the usual spiel of delivering on a "creative vision" and "aligning with the game's design and narrative goals". Yeah, uhuh, cool.</p>
<p>So what can we surmise from all of this? Absurd Ventures are working on a game that sounds quite like GTA. But if their latest <a href="https://x.com/AbsurdVentures/status/1790448666844754190">Xweet</a> is any indication of the vibe they're setting, I'd imagine it's going to be edgy alright.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-switch-online-players-just-got-an-important-piece-of-zelda-history.872598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24157710/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-links-awakening-the-frog-for-whom-the-bell-tolls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YTeolB">While here in the US the Nintendo Switch Online service got <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157336/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-update-super-mario-land">three new Mario games this week</a> (yes, <em>Alleyway </em>is a Mario game), the update for Japan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4czuDKwgc8">included a bonus classic</a> you may not have heard of. <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em> (officially translated as <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>) was a Japanese Game Boy release, co-developed by the familiar tag-team of Nintendo R&amp;D1 and Intelligent Systems, responsible for much of the Game Boy’s lineup. And while <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>may not be a household name, if you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23609051/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-nintendo-switch-online-ending"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em></a> (and who isn’t?) you should take the time to play it.</p>
<p id="VfJMLS">“<em>Link’s Awakening</em>’s development story is retold time and time again, but what’s almost always left out is that it’s built directly on top of [...] <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em>,” Nintendo Life’s Jon Cartwright details in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaOhJbSufJI">this excellent video</a>. That is really apparent when you see the game in motion. From the engine to the font to the transition from top-down to side-scrolling, <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>should look familiar.</p>
<p id="9wYiKi">Something else should look familiar to those of you who have played <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. Prince Richard, the weird guy with the frogs living in Pothole Field, who asks you to help him find his five Golden Leaves? That character is actually from <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>, and even the music that plays in his villa is a variation on that game’s theme. Here’s a description from Marc Normandin’s fun <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/its-new-to-me-for-the-frog-the-bell">RetroXP newsletter</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="TLLzVC">Prince Richard is actually not the protagonist of For the Frog the Bell Tolls, but is instead the best friend of him. The protagonist is the Prince of Sable, named and controlled by you. The adventure begins with the two princes (oh no) finding out that a princess is in trouble and must be saved, leading to the two trying to race the other to the finish line.</p></blockquote>

</p></div>
<p id="hrEv6R">Another familiar face for the Smash Bros. fans out there is the aforementioned Prince Sable, who shows up as an Assist Trophy, using his frog and snake powers. Oh right, about those, again <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/its-new-to-me-for-the-frog-the-bell">from Normandin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="OpsBjG">Prince Sable can transform into a frog or a snake, and eventually, can do so basically at will. A witch turns Prince Richard and his men — who arrived to save Princess Tiramisu from Delarin first — into frogs, and then later on, turns the Prince of Sable into a frog as well.</p></blockquote>

<p id="bYvilN">If you don’t live in Japan or don’t read Japanese, don’t worry! An <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/1623/">English fan translation</a> was created in 2011, which can be applied to a copy of the ROM . (Or, if you prefer, <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6517/">here is an updated version</a> that changes the title from <em>For the Frog the Bell Tolls</em> to Nintendo’s now “official” translation <em>The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls</em>.) As far as how to apply patches to ROM files, or how to dump a cartridge to obtain a ROM file, I will leave that up to you and your ability to search the internet. From there, you just need to find a suitable emulator — and these days <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">even iPhones</a> are in on the game. </p>

Players will be able increase their power by seeking out minor bosses and defeating them, so this will be an additional factor to consider besides your level when entering the Land of Shadow.</p><p>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.
