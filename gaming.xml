			<p>The long-running debate over video games as art is fortunately mostly a thing of the past, though it’s often up to indie games to help prop up any arguments that still rage. Obviously what makes a game – or any piece of media – art is a complex and largely subjective issue. You might point to the aesthetic approach, the narrative, or the interplay between presentation and mechanics. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes ticks all of these boxes and is perhaps the closest you’ll get to arthouse cinema in modern gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="LORELEI AND THE LASER EYES | Coming to PlayStation December 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcnwQKFgbds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The aesthetic of Lorelei is immediately striking, with its largely monochromatic palette clearly echoing the golden age of black and white movies. The minimalistic artstyle manages to be both retro and timeless, generally doing so without generally relying on aping the pixelated or polygonal graphics of bygone eras.</p>


<p>Much of Lorelei takes place in relative quiet, with your explorations being accompanied mostly by the loud echo of your footsteps. Whilst much of the soundtrack is little more than an ambient drone, there are some memorable tunes to be heard with Radio Waves and the title track being particular standouts.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of Lorelei feels like a fusion of survival horror and Myst-like puzzles, but with a more mathematical turn. You explore a mysterious mansion with a multitude of locked doors and incongruous mechanisms, but there is no weaponry or combat to be found here. Initially your exploration is very limited and linear, but as you progress you’ll find a series of shortcut doors that require specific mathematical or logical puzzles to be solved. The maths here is more along the lines of pattern recognition rather than complex sums or algebra that would have you breaking out graph paper and a graphical calculator, so you don’t need to worry if you haven’t simplified an equation for a few years. Every face button has the same function, which is perhaps my only real complaint – the lack of a quick back button to exit the inventory menu soon becomes a little irritating.</p>
<p>The various rooms of Lorelei’s mansion contain a dizzying number of documents and notes that serve as clues for the puzzles you’ll encounter. Whilst items are mostly restricted to keys (and objects that work as keys) you’ll be referring to your notes constantly. Despite the easy access to your file of documents, I also made extensive use of pen and paper to plot out ideas, possible answers to riddles and make notes of shapes and patterns. This aspect really brought me back to a much older style of gaming, as well as making the game a fantastically engaging form of impromptu multiplayer with my teenage children. Only one person can control what happens, but the puzzles really come into their own with multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>The narrative of Lorelei is as labyrinthine as the mansion in which it takes place. You play as a young Lorelei who must explore the home of her much older self and unravel the mysteries of her life. The game is closely intertwined with visual art, classic cinema, and screenwriting and the end result is a fascinating mixture of media that manages to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>It even manages to engage with the history of gaming with one subquest involving a haunted PS1-era game – the one time that the game does lean in on retro polygonal graphics – which you enter and have to deliberately glitch out following clues hidden in the documents found around the house. This is a perfect example of the multi-layered nature of the puzzles in Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. There are some small standalone moments but much of the game is magnificently interwoven. I’m hoping to find time to play through it again in order to unpick the twists and turns in the narrative soon.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Lorelei is one of the best puzzle adventures in recent years and deserves to be spoken about on the same level as the likes of Zork and Myst. On the surface it feels like an arthouse take on survival horror, but the depth and complexity of its narrative, combined with the superb puzzles and uniquely stylish aesthetic makes this a modern-day classic.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, as part of their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/02/remedy-q4-2024-ir-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year 2024 financial report</a>, Remedy confirmed that Alan Wake 2 has finally surpassed two million units sold. As you might remember, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-forza-motorsport-alan-wake-2-npd-circana-october-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with sales</a> despite being critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>Remedy CEO Virtala also revealed that the development and marketing costs have finally been recouped, and the developer has begun earning royalties for Alan Wake 2 towards the end of the last quarter. The executive credited the game's continued support with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake House expansions</a>, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro update</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry update</a>, and of course the retail version of Alan Wake 2, for helping push the sales of the horror game, especially during the latest Holiday period.</p>
<p>Overall, revenue increased by 49.3% to €50 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Operating profit also improved compared to last year but remained negative. Still, Remedy is hopeful for the future, stating that 2025 will mark a new era of sustainable and stable growth. The Finnish developer has the ambitious goal of doubling the 2024 revenue by 2027 while retaining an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin of 30%.</p>
<p>Following Alan Wake 2, Remedy is now fully committed to its next projects, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, which CEO Tero Virtala confirmed for a 2025 launch. The executive also said that in December, the development team successfully conducted a closed technical test with external players, testing the game's matchmaking and backend services and collecting data to shape the final game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> has just entered full production after establishing production pipelines and verifying asset creation speed. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</a> is also making 'steady progress' in full production, and it is now heading towards 'key objectives' that were agreed upon with publisher and IP owner Rockstar Games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Remedy_Slate-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but certainly not least, Remedy is apparently also working on an unannounced project, as evidenced by the slide posted above. The studio hasn't shared any information yet, though, which suggests that it's at an early stage of development.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-2">Ninja Gaiden 2</a> Black has received a major update, adding a New Game+ mode and a photo mode.</p>
<p>New Game+ allows players to begin a new game on any difficulty level previously cleared with all weapons and Ninpo spells unlocked (though they revert to level one).</p>
<p>Photo mode, meanwhile, is accessed in the options menu and allows players to pause the action and move the camera around to take screenshots. It's pretty basic, but a nice addition.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the update, on top of a handful of bug fixes, players can now hide their projectile weapon for a cleaner look, and Team Ninja has made a few balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Specifically, these mainly impact missions where players take control of Ryu's various female companions: the enemies in chapters 8 and 11 have had their HP lowered, while the number of enemies in chapters 13 and 14 (the latter played as Ryu) has been raised. Ayane has also seen a buff to her attacks.</p>
<p>The full patch notes can be found on the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">Team Ninja website</a>.</p>
<p>The update is available now across all versions: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Microsoft Store, Steam).</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was shadow dropped at the recent Xbox Developer Direct - it's a revised version of the Xbox 360 game Ninja Gaiden 2, with elements from its Sigma release on PS3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-ninja-gaiden-2-black-isnt-perfect-but-its-the-best-version-yet">Digital Foundry described the release</a> as "the best version yet", though it's not perfect.</p>
<p>The release comes ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with Team Ninja collaborating with action game experts PlatinumGames and adding in a new playable protagonist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of upcoming survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have warned fans that some dastardly do-badders are sending "fraudulent invites" to a playtest for the game via Steam messages. The playtest isn't real, say Unknown Worlds, who point out that any such invite will only come in an email from their own domain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have been made aware that fraudulent invites to a Subnautica 2 playtest are being sent on Steam to our community," said community manager Donya Abramo on the game's official Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/subnautica-2-devs-warn-players-about-fraudulent-links-to-a-playtest-for-its-upcoming-underwater-survival-game-stay-safe-out-there-subnauts/">GamesRadar</a>). "We will never contact you directly on Steam to invite you to any of our User Research Studies or playtesting opportunities."</p>

<p>The studio did ask for players to take part in a user research study last month, but the link to that was on Discord too. "Any contact regarding studies or playtests will only ever be sent by email from an Unknown Worlds address," adds Abramo. She asks any poor soul who has already clicked a link to change their Steam password, and points them to Valve's own <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0A94-F308-34A5-1988">help page for those with stolen or hijacked accounts</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, the best advice is to simply never click any link anyone sends you, ever. I practice this daily and look at me, blissfully unaware of all things. Although if said link offered the chance to splash about in even a rockpool of sea water from the anticipated sequel to one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">the best survival games</a>, I would at least be sad to dismiss that fantasy. </p>
<p>The last we heard of Subnautica 2 was following a trailer released by the studio last year. The sea-quel will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-coming-in-2025-with-four-player-co-op-heres-the-announcement-trailer">have four player co-op</a> and its early access is set to last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">at least a couple of years</a>. It's due out some time this year. In the meantime, be wary of phishing. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Another wave of redundancies has hit Unity, the company behind the ubiquitous video games engine.
</p>
<p>
The latest job losses - which appear to include all members of some teams - are the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-likely-to-announce-layoffs-to-cut-costs">sixth in the past three years</a>, during which time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-makes-further-job-cuts-as-it-ends-agreement-with-weta-fx">roughly 3500 staff</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">been let go</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Unity team members impacted by the latest cull reportedly woke to find out their fate via an email sent from a noreply@unity address at 5am Pacific time, stating their role had been "eliminated" by organisational changes (thanks, <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/">80.lv</a>).
</p>
<p>
Unity CEO Matthrew Bromberg later confirmed the job cuts in an internal memo, obtained by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lv</a>, in which he mentioned the repeated nature of job losses at the company.
</p>
<p>
"I know that there is some exhaustion associated with prior changes at Unity that haven't delivered the promised results, but 2025 is going to be the year where we bring to market products and services that will transform our position in the marketplace and provide a springboard to long-term growth," Bromberg claimed.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff say the latest cuts amount to "mass layoffs", including senior staff who had been at the company for years.
</p>
<p>
Included in the cuts are the entire Unity Behavior development team, which worked on a visual tool for programming NPCs and objects.
</p>
<p>
One affected team member, Shanee Nishry, reported that everyone working on the project had been let go in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1imk2qv/unity_just_laid_off_the_entire_staff_for_their/">post on reddit</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer," Nishry wrote. "I've reached out to leadership to ask if they can open-source the project, but there is no guarantee."
</p>
<p>
Unity has yet to tell staff the total number of jobs lost. Eurogamer has contacted the company for comment.

<p>As per Remedy's latest financial report, the thriller sequel had recouped its development fees and marketing investments by the end of 2024, and had started accruing royalty income.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 released digitally back in October 2023 across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The budget for the game was estimated at €70m (£58m), making it one of the most expensive cultural products to come from Finland.</p>

<p>By September last year, the game had recouped "most" of its development costs, according to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-has-now-recouped-most-of-the-money-it-cost-to-make">company's financial results at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Last year also saw Remedy release two DLCs for the game: Night Springs in June, and The Lake House in October.</p>
<p>The company credits these expansions, along with the physical edition release, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch, and other ongoing quality of life updates for Alan Wake 2's long-term sales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy reaffirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak will release this year</a> - it's a three-player co-op first-person shooter set in the world of Control.</p>
<p>Remakes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 and 2 are in "full production" together with publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>, though remain without a release date.</p>

<p>Bobby Kotick, the infamous former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has revealed on a podcast which studio acquisition taught him ‘an expensive lesson’ almost twenty years ago. While sitting down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts, Kotick took a stroll down memory lane, looking back over the last forty years of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>When it was mentioned by Gordon that Kotick and his team had a ‘flawless’ mergers and acquisitions record, Kotick set the story straight by mentioning one studio buyout that was less than ideal. In his words, it was an $80 million lesson.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-wrote-it-off">‘We Wrote it Off’</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast</a>, which at the time of publishing is unlisted on YouTube, Kotick took a quick dive into an awful acquisition that Activision made before merging with Blizzard in 2008.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not true, we actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>We bought the company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox, and it was called… (blanks)</p>



<p>They had a good guy who was running the day-to-day, but he was like… A brilliant guy who — like a ‘McKenzie guy’, and he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and we wrote it off two years later. It was everything — everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this segment, Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing, a series of titles that were exclusive to the Xbox platform. While the acquisition <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-buys-studio-behind-project-gotham-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">left Microsoft with the PGR label</a>, Activision would lean on Bizarre Creations to piece together ‘Blur’, which was released in 2010, three years after the 2007 buy-out occurred.</p>



<p>Blur was intended to be released in 2009, but it was <a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/f2927482-7047-46da-b069-cfd2cc95acd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delayed by Activision</a> to allow Bizarre to further polish the game.</p>



<p>Less than a year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarre-says-goodbye-with-farewell-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision closed Bizarre Creations</a>, dissolving the studio (which was based in Liverpool and not Manchester, as Kotick suggested) and releasing around 200 employees.</p>



<p>To this day, the Project Gotham Racing series stands abandoned</p>



<p>Kotick went on to walk Gordon through Activision’s former acquisition processes, which were centred mostly around retaining the identity of studios and allowing them to keep doing what they were <strong>already </strong>doing. By contrast, he explained how Electronic Arts – Gordon’s former company – would ‘take over’ acquired studios and rebrand them, stripping out their image somewhat.</p>



<p>In the same discussion on the Grit podcast (props to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), both Gordon and Kotick explained that, once upon a time, Electronic Arts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-almost-owned-cod-blizzard/">almost purchased Activision and Blizzard</a>, which would have left franchises like Call of Duty under the EA umbrella.</p>

<p>In a recent interview as part of an episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast, Bobby Kotick sat down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts. It was revealed in the earlier minutes of the episode – which spans a whopping two hours – that Electronic Arts once passed up opportunities to acquire Blizzard, Call of Duty, and Guitar Hero, among other brands.</p>



<p>Eventually, Activision Blizzard, which was formerly led by Bobby Kotick as CEO, was purchased in its entirety by Microsoft, with the tech titan acquiring all aforementioned labels.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grit podcast episode</a> opened with Bobby Kotick suggesting that Bing Gordon would have been one of the toughest CEOs in gaming to deal with as a competitor and that he and his team would have <strong>paid </strong>to keep the then-CEO in place at Electronic Arts. It was all in jest and talk turned to mergers and acquisitions, with Gordon gushing over Kotick’s notorious success in the space.</p>



<p>That’s not entirely true, though – Kotick explained some of the rougher patches of the M&amp;A streak:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>The company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox… We had a good guy who was running the day-to-day but he was like a brilliant guy, who — he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and like, we wrote it off two years later. Everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can assume Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing – but the studio was based in Liverpool, not Manchester.</p>



<p>Kotick then explained how Electronic Arts tried acquiring Activision and Blizzard (assumedly pre- the 2008 merger):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gordon then expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While you were doing Blizzard, <strong>that EA passed on</strong>, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These revelations were in the first ten minutes of the two-hour podcast episode. It’s a plethora of gaming history that sees Gordon and Kotick walk down memory lane while discussing the origin stories of some of the biggest franchises in the business.</p>



<p>In one segment of the podcast (thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), Kotick explained how Overwatch was created at Blizzard. He stressed that it went against the Blizzard ‘aesthetic’ and mentioned it was ‘unbelievable’ that the team pieced it together after focusing on ‘dark’ games for so long.</p>



<p>Do you think Electronic Arts would have tanked the Call of Duty brand as it did with Medal of Honor and (arguably) Battlefield? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass is set to add a classic Call of Duty game to its library as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is heading to the subscription service. And that’s 2009’s Modern Warfare 2, not the game of the same name released in 2022.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/12/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-heading-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, Modern Warfare 2 will be coming to the service either in March or April this year. Insider Gaming sources can corroborate this report. </p>







<p>As of writing, it remains unclear if it’s the full game coming to the service or just the campaign. It’s also unknown if it’s the original version of the game or the remastered campaign. When it does release on the service, Modern Warfare 2 will become the first classic Call of Duty game to be available for Game Pass members. It will join recent titles Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3 (2023) as the only games in the series to be available.</p>



<p>What do you think of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 coming to Xbox Game Pass in the near future?&nbsp;Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/buzzfeed-ceo-wants-to-solve-the-internet%E2%80%99s-problems-by-making-his-own-version-of-those-problems.1106340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Tuesday, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced his company will be launching its own social media platform, news he buried at the end of a long, tone-deaf <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/the-anti-snarf-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manifesto</a> about how AI and big tech are ruining what it means to be online. This is, to Peretti’s credit, true, but if you’re worried his solution will be to stem the onslaught of journalistic job losses or fight back against the AI companies that want to fill the internet with even more crap, don’t be: he’s not doing any of that.</p><p>The manifesto is called “The Anti-SNARF Manifesto,” which is not a reference to <em>ThunderCats</em> but instead a clumsy acronym for “<strong>S</strong>takes/<strong>N</strong>ovelty/<strong>A</strong>nger/<strong>R</strong>etention/<strong>F</strong>ear,” which Peretti believes drives the current algorithmically-based news and social media ecosystems. He writes that </p><blockquote><p>The type of content that gets created and recommended is not the best content, but the content that elicits the most compulsive and predictable response from the human brain. When the platforms don’t care about content and ask the AI to maximize usage, the content evolves into what I call ‘SNARF.’ </p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The manifesto takes aim at TikTok and Meta for focusing on technology and algorithms instead of quality content, claiming that these algorithms then lead to situations in which (emphasis his)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Content creators <strong>exaggerate stakes</strong> to make their content urgent and existential. They <strong>manufacture novelty</strong> and spin their content as unprecedented and unique. They <strong>manipulate anger</strong> to drive engagement via outrage. They <strong>hack</strong> <strong>retention</strong> by withholding information and promising a payoff at the end of a video. And they <strong>provoke</strong> <strong>fear</strong> to make people focus with urgency on their content.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Peretti believes that “Through this lens, MAGA and ‘woke’ are the same thing! They both are versions of political ideas that spread through raw negative emotion, outrage, and novelty.” He writes that “the AI-powered platforms have... delivered a MAGA President that spews SNARF and a woke counter-culture that celebrates the assassination of a health insurance executive — big stakes, lots of novelty, and plenty of anger, retention, and fear!”&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think Peretti is wrong about content that <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obscures facts</a> or leans into <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-rant-facebook-dragon-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger</a> to drive clicks. In contrast, here’s a sample of current Buzzfeed headlines: “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikespohr/57-hilariously-unfortunate-people-youll-probably-feel-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">57 Hilariously Unfortunate People You'll Probably Feel A Little Bad Laughing At</a>,” “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexalisitza/political-tweets-of-the-week-2-10-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">21 Political Tweets From Last Week That Made Me Look Up At The Sky And Yell, ‘OMFG, YES’,"</a> and “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/abbyzinman/70s-male-heartthrobs-trivia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">These 25 Male Celebs Were Huge Heartthrobs In The '70s — But I'll Be Shocked If Literally Anyone Under 35 Can Name Them Now</a>," Buzzfeed claimed in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/why-buzzfeed-doesnt-do-clickbait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2014</a> that it “doesn’t do clickbait,” and by its own definition, I’d agree: You know exactly what you’re getting with these articles, and they even tell you how you’re going to feel about them. (You could call this, as Peretti chides SNARF for above, a “predictable response,” but anyway!) All of it is designed for social sharing and compulsive engagement based on a particular kind of <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/03/i-hate-myself-because-i-dont-work-for-buzzfeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brainrot</a> that Buzzfeed pioneered to great success, one of value-neutral <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/technology/how-buzzfeeds-tasty-conquered-online-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped-down utility</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Buzzfeed was at the forefront of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/11/28/this-is-your-brain-on-buzzfeed-the-science-of-viral-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral content</a>, arguably a precursor to the very “SNARF” Peretti rails against. The spread of that content took a hit from changing social media algorithms alongside every other outlet; in the years since, Buzzfeed has struggled to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/building-the-defining-media-company-for-the-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regain its footing</a>, so perhaps it’s no wonder Peretti spends so long being pissed off at social platforms. But Buzzfeed can’t compete not just because the internet doesn’t work like it did in the company’s heyday, but because the articles on Buzzfeed’s page aren’t <em>about</em> anything. Peretti uses the changing nature of virality to conflate Trump’s rhetoric with the widespread response to <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi Mangione</a>; he seems to believe these things go wide primarily because they upset people, and he doesn’t explore much difference in <em>why</em> people are upset. But in pointing out the real ways our emotions get manipulated on the internet, Peretti also seems to take aim at any kind of content that elicits <em>real</em> emotions. He’s not wrong that it’s less fun to disagree about health care and human rights than it is what color a dress is or which Golden Girl you are. But it takes a particular kind of Rich Guy Brain to spin that out into the idea that both sides are equally bad because, as he writes, “the result is an endless stream of addictive content that leaves everyone feeling depressed, scared, and dissatisfied.” People are, in fact, legitimately depressed, scared, and dissatisfied, and while I agree that plenty of news outlets and content creators lean into that to drive hollow engagement, Peretti’s view seems to fundamentally disbelieve that people earnestly want to care about real things.&nbsp;</p><p>Peretti putting the onus for some of this on AI is laughable when his own company has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/media/buzzfeed-news-shuts-down/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">axed its Pulitzer Prize-winning news desk</a> and conducted <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/buzzfeed-layoffs-new-restructuring-1235831847/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, leaning its full weight into <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/media/buzzfeed-ai-content-creation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/buzzfeed-ai-creators-news-shut-down-1235483607/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creators</a> instead. If it’s algorithms over people that’s driving all this, wouldn’t the smart alternative be thoughtful content created by real people; i.e., hiring journalists? If the AI-driven social media platforms are the problem, why would the solution be for Peretti to create his own social media platform “built specifically to spread joy and enable playful creative expression”? Peretti writes that “this social media platform will use AI to give users agency instead of stealing their agency,” whatever that means technologically, and whatever “agency” looks like when held up against a platform whose defining feature seems to be “good vibes only.” &nbsp;</p><p>In the course of the manifesto, Peretti does remember that he also owns the remains of some outlets. He lays out his plans for them:&nbsp; Buzzfeed proper “will bring more fun and playfulness back to the internet with low stakes content that is pure entertainment” and also, somehow, “counter the increase of gaslighting and misinformation by speaking to our diverse audience in ways that other institutions, media, and platforms clearly won’t.” The reporters left at <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-editor-in-chief-resigns-layoffs-danielle-belton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a> (who are now surrounded by the worst people you know in the news desks at the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-administration-throwing-more-pentagon-reporters-out_n_67a75e7fe4b077fd2382e9e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentagon</a>) will be “using ‘SNARF for good’” by writing, well, news. Food brand Tasty, once my favorite hate read, “will fight SNARF with utility and social connection… the Tasty app will give us our own platform to grow usage and loyalty by integrating capabilities such as AI recipe remixing, community tips and challenges, and creator-led content.”</p><p>Peretti can’t even make it through a paragraph about his own outlets before pivoting back into celebrating the very problems he rails against, an AI-driven tech platform that incentivizes creators. The main difference seems to be not just that it’s, you know, <em>nice</em> stuff, but that it’s <em>his</em> nice stuff. “I’m fed up with giving the platform companies advice about how to fix the internet, if we want this done right, we have to do it ourselves!” he writes. This is a man who claims to both “look forward to counter-programming with our human creativity fighting against the machine,” and a man who in December <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/buzzfeed-sells-hot-ones-studio-first-we-feast-rcna183956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Hot Ones</a>, a wildly popular interview food show that sounds exactly like what Peretti seems to think the internet needs, except that it is made by and for actual humans, and as such cannot be turned into a tech product.</p><p>Buzzfeed has looked everywhere for relevance except in hiring real human people to make good work for other humans to read. But “hire reporters” doesn’t boost a company’s stock valuation or give it a tech product to tote around for investment. Peretti is trying to solve the problems he identifies with the same problems, just with his own bright yellow “LOL” badge slapped over them. I look forward to whatever “listicles, but it’s a social media network” turns out to be.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-network-outage-psn-ps5-pc"><h3>The PlayStation Network Outage Is Modern Gaming In A Nutshell</h3></a><p>PSN went down for 24 hours, and Sony won't even give us an explanation</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallen-london-rpg-kickstarter-raises-six-times-its-funding-goal-day-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magpie-games-and-failbetter-games-announces-official-fallen-london-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fallen London RPG</a></em> has gone live. Magpie Games' official tabletop adaptation of Failbetter Games' alternate history gothic fantasy world has made an impressive start, raising more than six times its initial funding goal on day one.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> is set in the same world created by Failbetter Games. A setting made up of the browser-based Fallen London game and the various videogame spin-offs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunless-sea-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Seas</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mask-of-rose-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mask of the Rose</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-london-rpg-character-artwork.jpg?itok=RzsYmQ6e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-london-rpg-character-artwork.jpg?itok=clsCcmKA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in 1899, forty years after Victorian London fell into a vast cavern under the Earth known as the Neath. This has led to London becoming a twisted version of itself. Hell is close, immortality is cheap, and Empress Victoria still reigns. But the screaming has mostly stopped.</p>

<p>For certain enterprising people, it is a city full of opportunities. Players can explore these opportunities in the <em>Fallen London RPG</em>. Fame, power, defeating Death itself, opening a gate to the stars, or even restoring London to the surface are goals that can be pursued.</p>

<p>The RPG is made up of two books. The Core Book is 200+ pages and contains everything needed to play. The second book, <em>Guide to London</em>, is over 100 pages and contains new character options.</p>

The group, called a Concern, are devoted to a single Grand Ambition, a major goal that no single character can achieve on their own. But just because those ambitions are grand does not mean they are good. Members of the Concern don't even need to be friendly to one another; they just need to be united in their goal.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> will also feature an original TTRPG system. The&nbsp;Ædana System, built on Magpie Games' ten-year history of game development, is a flexible system built around a simple central dice mechanic. You roll a number of d6s equal to your skill level. More dice are added for situational or environmental bonuses. A 5 or a 6 is a Hit. The more Hits you roll, the better the result.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has the following pledge tiers:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Deliciously Digital for $29:</strong> PDFs of the Core Book and Guide to London</li>
	<li><strong>Watcher for $59:</strong> A physical copy of the Core Book and PDFs of the Core Book and <em>Guide to London</em></li>
	<li><strong>Agent for $99.</strong> Physical and PDF copies of both the Core Book and <em>Guide to London</em> and a Benthic Kriegsspiel digital item for Fallen London</li>
	<li><strong>Midnighter for $149:</strong> Everything in the Agent tier, a GM Screen, and a set of custom <em>Fallen London</em> dice</li>
	<li><strong>Master of the Bazaar for $299:</strong> Everything in the Midnighter tier, a set of Neathbow dice, a Deluxe Core Book, and a Sullier of Probabilities digital item for <em>Fallen London</em></li>
</ul><p>In addition, the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has unlocked additional extras thanks to hitting certain stretch goals. These include official VTT support for both Roll20 and Alchemy, new NPCs being added to the Core Book like Sinning Jenny and Virginia, and official <em>Fallen London</em> dice trays.</p>

<p>At time of writing the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has raised&nbsp;$313,727, more than six times its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign will conclude March 2025. The RPG is expected to ship in August 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-citadel-is-gory-obscene-and-almost-a-masterpiece.1106319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>God is in his heaven, all is right with the world. Credit: doekuramori</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>There are certain games or works of art that I cannot recommend without severe caveats. <em>Beyond Citadel </em>fits this category. It is an unapologetically horny game that contains brutal and graphic violence punctuated by moments of immense melancholy. It has a plot and world that is difficult to parse. It also happens to be, mechanically, one of the best made shooters I have played in years, and possibly the most successfully-realized followup to Bungie’s <em>Marathon </em>to date.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WARNING: This article contains graphic and suggestive images that may be upsetting for some people.</strong></p><p><em>Beyond Citadel </em>is a follow up to <em>The Citadel, </em>a retro shooter by solo Japanese developer doekuramori. In both, you play a character known as The Martyr. Humanity has suffered a near extinction-level collapse, and those who remain exist through the use of cybernetic enhancement. In the first game, <em>The Citadel</em>, the remnants of humanity were enslaved by an entity known as The Sleeping God. <em>The Citadel </em>follows The Martyr’s attempt to destroy the guardian angels and kill the aforementioned slumbering deity.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The gore in this game is very nasty. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p><em>Beyond Citadel </em>picks up after the first game and follows a similar structure: The Martyr has returned to the titular citadel, and now must defeat seven trumpeters, all the while learning about her past. The world is bleak, surreal, and desolate, and if you’ve ever seen <em>The End of Evangelion </em>or played <em>Nier: Automata</em>, you may find the trappings rhyme a little.</p><p>There are two things that you notice when you first start playing <em>Beyond Citadel</em>. The first is the sheer degree of grotesque violence in the game, although the 2D sprites mean that it is often done cartoonishly. Enemies not only explode into gibbering viscera, they also occasionally die slowly, sometimes panting for breath as they bleed out and occasionally pointing a gun at you as they die.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing you notice is that several of the characters are skimpily-rendered anime women. The Martyr’s outfit ranges from being a more revealing take on Leeloo’s bandage costume from <em>The Fifth Element</em> to an equally revealing riff on the costume from <em>Æon Flux</em>. When The Martyr dies, the player is often confronted with a first person view of her body being torn apart by bullets in graphic detail. In addition to this, the game features a gallery of borderline (although not fully nude) pornographic shots of The Martyr in compromising positions. Although I did not see any nudity in the game, not much is left to the imagination. Both the game’s gore and the skimpy gallery can be disabled in the menu, which is a nice option for people who just would like to play a good retro shooter.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Martyr's can sometimes find a backup body in case they die. Their outfit leaves little to the imagination. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>While <em>The Citadel </em>had a structure and quality akin to a very solid <em>DOOM </em>WAD, <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is light years better. The basic level structure of the game has increased in complexity and there is a verticality to the world that was simply not present in <em>The Citadel</em>. As your character levels up and gains new abilities like double jumps and air dashes, new pathways through the level become available to you. Instead of going down a tightly controlled corridor where enemies have the high ground, finding a secret way to the roof and dispatching opposing snipers from a higher vantage point might be the best option. <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is also masterful at slowly increasing the complexity, adding in vehicle segments where you drive tanks, mechs and aircraft that are surprisingly fun to play.</p><figure><figcaption>Boss encounters usually involve using a one-time weapon in an arena. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the increased level complexity, the weapon system in <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is pseudo-tactical in style. The game gives you three settings options for how technical you want your gunplay to be: ‘load only with no jam,’ ‘load and cock,’ and ‘unload, load and cock.’ I highly recommend at least experimenting with the latter two even on an easier difficulty setting, as they add a rhythm and tension to the game that really sets it apart from other retro shooters. Being able to lean around corners also adds to the tension of being pinned down by a hail of enemy bullets.</p><figure><figcaption>The train level is very Outlaws-inspired. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>Individual bullets have to be accounted for, and each gun develops a distinct feel and pattern that becomes organic. These weapons also develop in complexity with various mods, which allows every gun to be viable throughout the game. On top of this, each slot has three different weapons to choose from, allowing you to customize your loadout. During my playthrough I fell in love with the Cavalry Carbine with a scoped mod, a precise medium range gun which has to be chambered between rounds. The button to chamber and aim down sight were the same, so double right clicking became a natural part of the flow of gunplay. Guns in the game also have significant bullet drop, and accounting for that while taking out an enemy from across the map feels fantastic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Outlaws playthrough- Level 3 - The Train" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39eH0iq27II?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Outlaws rocks.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of all the guns, the carbine in particular feels like it was dropped straight out of 1997 LucasArts shooter <em>Outlaws</em>. This is not a coincidence, as doekuramori’s own Twitter bio reads “Developing Outlaws &amp; Marathon-like FPS / Gun simulator hybrid -Beyond Citadel-”. Reading the word “<em>Outlaws</em>” set my heart aflutter as I love that game dearly and, <a href="https://aftermath.site/27-years-later-lucasarts-afterlife-is-brilliant-brutal-and-few-know-how-to-beat-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like the game <em>Afterlife</em></a>, feel like it remains an underappreciated gem in the Lucasarts catalogue.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relics (PC-88) Playthrough" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVv2IW3WrYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As a developer, doekuramori is unambiguous in what projects influenced their games: <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, the work of H.R.

This fascination in a biomechanical world is something I deeply appreciate and relate to as someone who grew up on the works of Shin’ya Tsukamoto like <em>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>The manga BLAME! is a key inspiration.

A version of this appears in the game’s gallery only if you disable the erotic fan art in the settings. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>Part of what makes reviewing <em>Beyond Citadel </em>difficult is how obtuse the story can be. Some of this is a language barrier – the translation is not great, and it feels like much is being lost. Many of the explanations for how the world fits together are primarily in Japanese or on the developer’s Twitter account. Another difficulty is that there is an intentional ambiguity in how certain elements of the world fit together. Every zone ends with The Martyr defeating a large boss, setting off a bomb and presumably dying in the explosion only to be reborn later in another vessel. Between these zones, The Martyr visits a liminal space similar to the Black Lodge from <em>Twin Peaks</em> or the <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/End_of_Time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">End of Time</a> from <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, and meets their brother Elulu. These sudden moments of quiet and rest are often deployed in a shockingly endearing way. The Martyr is clearly several different clones, and so how real are any of these experiences, and how reliable is The Martyr’s perspective? Is the consciousness of The Martyr the same from body to body? It is clear that there is a greater plan underway that The Martyr is simply a pawn in (the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Millenarianism</a> is thrown around a bunch near the end), but piecing how these fit together can sometimes feel like trying to solve a conspiracy.</p><figure><figcaption>doekuramori gives a lot of updates and explanations not present in the game on Twitter. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who likes a lot of transgressive art, I don’t really like debating the morality of surreal violence in art, but it is fair to say this game will just put a lot of people off. It should also be said that <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is not a perfect game even if you accept it on its own terms – it overstayed its welcome for me a little in the last third, although that is exacerbated if you complete all the optional side stages. And I will say I straight up did not enjoy the core motivation of the main characters once they were revealed. At the same time, I must also admit that’s clearly the entire point of the narrative – this is a world fallen from grace, and you are meant to feel severe discomfort at what The Martyr and others have done, down to the gasping mindless automatons holding their guns in while raising a single, shaking pistol at you.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tallboy. Credit: doekuramori</figcaption></figure><p><em>Beyond Citadel </em>is a story about sin and redemption, and it takes massive swings in its world building that could only come from a true Otaku. Even if the combination of erotic fan art and grotesque violence didn’t always congeals into something I like, it is uniquely itself. Neither the violence or sexuality are what makes <em>Beyond Citadel </em>&nbsp;a good shooter, but it is also true that only someone with those proclivities like doekuramori, a dev who straight up retweets fan hentai of his characters, could have made this game.&nbsp;</p><p>Dominic Tarason said in his review for PC Gamer that <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is a game he wants to recommend to “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/beyond-citadel-is-a-great-retro-fps-that-i-want-to-recommend-to-everybody-and-nobody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everybody and nobody</a>”, and while I understand that, I actually <em>do </em>know specifically who this game is for. This is a game strictly for the freaks, a term I would safely use to describe myself with endearment. I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone, but neither would I make blanket recommendations for Throbbing Gristle, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl0D6GbUdN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any film by Kōji Wakamatsu</a>, the French novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Necrophiliac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Necrophiliac</em></a> and the undeniably gorgeous yet sadistic manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_Tsubaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shojo Tsubaki</em></a>. It is too depraved for unqualified praise, too unique to ignore, and technically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years. <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is a bizarre masterpiece, one that elevates it above the corny category “boomer shooter,” and I can’t safely say you’d find the experience an enjoyable one.</p><figure><figcaption>I love the Easter eggs in this game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-adamas-cod-league-next-level/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League has been the pinnacle of COD esports for the last five years. It’s the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem, a multi-million-dollar league backed by the biggest names in modern gaming such as FaZe, OpTic, Cloud9, and 100 Thieves. Behind the scenes, one company has worked tirelessly to bring several teams to the next level in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Enter Adamas, a performance, leadership, and development coaching organisation that has supported more than half the teams in the Call of Duty League. This effective, invaluable group has been a secret power for many of today’s CDL squads, including those that have gone on to claim the most lucrative prizes in the competitive space.</p>



<p>I was recently fortunate enough to catch up with Adamas at the CDL Madrid Major, and I took the opportunity to question some of the COD League’s players about the impact this organisation has on their performance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-adamas">The Power of Adamas</h2>



<p>I’ve been connected with <a href="https://www.adamasesports.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adamas</a> for more than two years, taking a special interest in the organisation around the time that the New York Subliners went on a phenomenal run through the 2023 CDL season. The squad managed to secure two Major trophies and then won COD Champs, all while under the guidance and gravity of Adamas Esports.</p>



<p>In the last three years, Adamas has directly influenced the performances of the teams that have claimed seven out of 13 possible major tournaments, including the Call of Duty League Championship and the inaugural Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>At the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overactive-media-cdl-major-in-madrid-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDL Major in Madrid</a>, Atlanta FaZe stormed to victory just weeks after winning the first CDL Minor, all while being closely aligned with Adamas and singing the company’s praises. I connected with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta FaZe’s superstar players</a> at the Major in Spain, catching up on their impressions of Adamas.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>(They have) <strong>helped us tremendously</strong>. I feel like with everything — every aspect of our team, when it comes to trusting each other, being more of a team in all those ways, I feel like (they’ve) been just insane.</em></p>



<p><em>They’ve done so much for us already.</em></p>



<p>– Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tyler went on to note that Adamas has made the team’s mentality ‘<em>tenfold better</em>‘.</p>



<p>Even those who don’t ‘believe’ in the practices that Adamas preaches eventually see the benefit in what the company offers. I caught up with Cellium, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, to get his two cents on Adamas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Yeah, I was going to say I’ve never really been a believer in that whole ‘thing’. (They have) <strong>definitely proved me wrong with that</strong>, because (they’ve) helped me and the team a lot.</em></p>



<p>– McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I also had a chance to chat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the LA Thieves</a>, sitting down with Scrap and Ghosty, two of the team’s more prolific players. They shared similar sentiments about Adamas, which also acts as a performance and development resource for the 100 Thieves-backed CDL team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I feel like <strong>it helps a lot with the team cameraderie</strong>, just being comfortable with each other, fully trusting each other, calming yourself down if you need to. Mostly the team cameraderie aspect.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re a brand-new team, only been playing with each other two, three months total, and speedening up the process, (they’ve) helped quite a bit with that.</em></p>



<p>– Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We’re all just a fun team to be around, we be hanging out outside of the game as well, I think we’re super comfortable on stage together. I think (they’ve) <strong>made it even better for us</strong>.</em></p>



<p>– Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-from-the-source">From the Source</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Matt Fisher has worked with the biggest names in Call of Duty esports</figcaption></figure>







<p>I had an extended chat with Matt ‘Fish’ Fisher, the Director of Performance at Adamas Esports and one of the nicest and most confident people I’ve ever met. He started his CDL journey with the New York Subliners, aligning himself with the industry greats like James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks and working to instil an ‘identity of athlete’ where the concept had never before surfaced.</p>



<p>He gave me the secret recipe for the company’s work inside the Call of Duty League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>One of our core philosophies at Adamas is that we take a human-centered approach. Regardless of the game you play, the happier and healthier you are as a human being, the better you will perform both in game and in life. </em></p>



<p><em>We haven’t taught a single COD player or coach how to improve their strategies or technical skills, but we have helped them recognise how optimising other aspects of their lives will have a carry-over effect to in-game.</em></p>



<p><em>Much of our work is in helping to establish and maintain a team culture and environment that is conducive to both wellness and performance. Our goal is to set these organisations up with a foundation that will lead to consistent performance year after year, and allow their talent to perform to their full potential.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the results are certainly front and centre for all to see. Fish gave me critical insights into the end-to-end process, from the team-building exercises to pre-match traditions and preparations. He noted that while we were talking, the Atlanta FaZe team was ‘meditating’ backstage, suggesting that it’s a practice that might seem unorthodox or invalid to some players.</p>



<p>That was shortly before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/drazah-shots-fired-lat-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FaZe went on to win</a> the first CDL Major of the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Last season, the Adamas folks teamed up with the LA Guerrillas, a squad that almost went dark for a while as it tussled with internal issues and a lack of funding.</p>



<p>The roster was made up mostly of untested talent, but as Fish put it,<em> ‘We feel like they were able to prove that a ‘bare bones’ team with minimum investment in player salaries and staff, supported by Adamas’ expertise, could lead to results that many considered a huge ‘overachievement’.’</em></p>



<p>From the top to the bottom, Adamas supports the Call of Duty League. The organisation helps the players immeasurably, but there’s also plenty of time spent with organisation owners and general managers, with the company promoting a growth mindset that allows the key decision-makers to <strong>make the <em>right</em> decisions</strong>, which at the end of the day, benefits <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-iv-dreamhack-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty League’s 2025 season</a> continues to unravel. From this Friday, the qualifiers are back for Major II, and beyond that, there are another five months of competitive coverage lined up.</p>

PlayStation and Xbox both charge for online multiplayer, so why not Nintendo? Well, no native voice chat for one, but hey, Nintendo’s gonna Nintendo. To sweeten the pot, the company threw in access to a growing library of classic NES games. For anyone who hadn’t already purchased a NES Classic two years earlier, it was a nice trip down memory lane for just $20 a year. </p><p>But since then it’s grown, and so has the price. Switch Online added SNES games in 2019, followed by Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games in 2021, which it bundled together in a separate Expansion Pack that increased the total annual price to $50. Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games are the latest to join that tiered library, which now includes over 200 games total across three generations of consoles and handhelds. </p><p>It feels more than a little absurd that the only way to (legally) access these games in the year 2025 is to effectively rent them for an annual fee. What started off as a welcome novelty drafting off the broader incorruptible enthusiasm for the Switch in its early years has now become a bit of a ripoff. I’m long past the point of wanting a giant buffet of retro games to occasionally peruse at my leisure. I know what I want to play and what I’ll keep returning to. Why am I spending $50 to show<em> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> to my kid for the first time? It was not always thus.</p><p>Nintendo has often lagged behind its competitors when it comes to online features and digital marketplaces, but it was actually first in letting players pay to download and play old games on modern consoles. The Wii launched in 2006 with the Virtual Console, offering old NES games for sale digitally including <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Mario Bros.</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. I still remember, during my first semester home from college, popping in my debit card to buy <em>Military Madness</em> and experiencing its amazing sci-fi soundtrack and moon-based warfare for the first time in a decade. </p><figure id="" data-id="736aae99131396ed81520eb393844dbc" data-recommend-id="image://736aae99131396ed81520eb393844dbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2250" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Switch Online is displayed on a Switch.

It was a perfect model with one glaring flaw on Nintendo’s hardware: your purchase history didn’t carry over from console to console. The Virtual Console on Wii was different from the one on 3DS which was different from the one on Wii U. Players had to keep buying the same games over and over again which became something of a joke, a bit of shorthand for how out of touch Nintendo was.</p><p>This frustration potentially paved the way for some of the initial positivity surrounding the launch of Switch Online. Finally a single, permanent library. No more buying<em> Excitebike</em> for the fourth time. Instead, it turns out the Switch would have been the perfect time to <em>keep</em> doing the Virtual Console. Nintendo has already confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2. All those downloaded copies of <em>StarTropics</em>, <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, and <em>Wonder Boy in Monster Land</em> would have actually carried over this time. </p><p>Instead Nintendo is playing the role of the last online Blockbuster, badgering me for $4 every time I want to revisit the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games, but without the option to just buy it by never returning it because it got lost under my car seat. Game Pass may have shattered the value proposition of buying stuff on Xbox, but at least it still lets you. Nintendo was once at the forefront of digital game preservation on console. Now we’ve got Switch Online, which feels like a relic from a stingier, more stubborn era at the company. </p><p>If Nintendo doesn’t bring back the Virtual Console for the Switch 2, things might only get more frustrating this time around. We could be looking at an annual $100 WaveBird Pack that adds all-time great GameCube games that will otherwise never get remade or ported, like <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash </em>and <em>Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader</em>. And I will pay it because I am a fanboy ruled by nostalgia and a chump. It doesn’t have to be this way. </p><p>Other publishers, including Capcom and Konami, have shown it’s possible to sell great anthologies of old games on Switch. Some have even partnered with companies like Digital Eclipse to add all kinds of extra bells and whistles, like auto-play options and vast in-game archives of everything from scans of original booklets to developer notes and sketches. Others have released HD collections, like Square Enix’s<em> Mana</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>  remasters.</p><p>“The existence of [Switch Online] doesn’t preclude Nintendo from <em>selling</em> these games, either, no more so than the existence of Netflix negates the idea of Blu-ray,” former <em>Kotaku </em>editor Chris Kohler (who now works at Digital Eclipse) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773">wrote back in 2018</a></span>.

<p>The competitive Rainbow Six Siege community has come to the support of a Team Secret player after the CEO of his team released him and criticized him for showing emotion after a loss. Numerous players and personalities are now calling out the CEO for their behavior.</p>



<hr>

<p>After being released by Team Secret following a group stage elimination at The Six Invitational, Australian player Jake “Virtue” Grannan posted on X that the move caught him by surprise. “Didn’t see this coming at all, after all the energy and work that I’ve been putting in,” he <a href="https://x.com/Virtue_R6/status/1889005812346941812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “One bad tournament has now lead me to be LFT [looking for team].”</p>



<p>However, a day later, Virtue and almost the entire Siege community were stunned by <a href="https://x.com/zypher84/status/1889338159739347427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reply</a> to this post made by Secret CEO John Yao. Yao shared a screenshot of the team after they were eliminated, showing Virtue facing away from the group. The caption reads: “I am also very surprised.”</p>



<p>This reply, which appears to disparage Virtue, has drawn the ire of several members of the Siege community. Virtue confirmed that he was very emotional, that he was “almost crying,” and that he “couldn’t look at anyone” after a bad series. Some of the game’s biggest stars came to Virtue’s defense, including M80’s Leonardo “Kyno” Figueiredo and DarkZero’s Jason “Beaulo” Doty. The replies and quote reposts are littered with players, casters, coaches, and others criticizing Yao and defending Virtue.</p>



<p>While many are clearly upset about Yao’s comments, they have at least opened the door for a greater conversation about men’s mental health. It’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to cry in front of others.</p>



<p>Did the Team Secret CEO cross the line? Should mental health become a bigger talking point in esports? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
