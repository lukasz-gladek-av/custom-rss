		<p>EA has taken a slightly different approach this year for its EA Sports FC 26 reveal trailer. Instead of just having footballers running around and playing the beautiful game, this reveal trailer addresses player complaints about the previous entries to the series and how FC 26 is looking to improve them. Of course, there are still the big name stars present in the trailer including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Jude Bellingham, and Jamal Musiala.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,”</em> said John Shepherd, VP &amp; GM, EA SPORTS FC. <em>“We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let’s dive into some of these changes coming to EA Sports FC 26 a bit more, beginning with the Archetypes system. The Archetypes system will be part of Clubs and Player Career, with it being a class system. As part of Archetypes you will be able to unlock and develop different attributes, along with Archetype perks that provide additional bonuses. These perks are based on some of the best players in football. The gameplay is getting overhauled again to make things more fluid and responsive, with examples being better dribbling, improved goalkeeper reactions, better ball behaviour, more fluid passing, and better off the ball player movement and interactions. As part of the overhaul Competitive Gameplay and Authentic Gameplay presets will be available to choose from. Competitive Gameplay is aimed for the multiplayer parts of FC 26 including Clubs and Ultimate Team, while the Authentic preset is more for single player modes like career.</p>
<p>Manager Career is being changed for this release too with the introduction of Manager Live. Manager Live will introduce various challenges into the manager career mode, and there will be new scenarios introduced that are based upon real world football events. In Ultimate Team, there will be new live events and tournaments to take part in. Rivals and Champs will also be given updates too. Finally, EA has confirmed FC 26 will include over 35 leagues, over 750 teams across clubs and international, 120 stadiums, and over 20,000 footballers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review, I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is introducing a way to let trusted friends chat more freely among themselves, but it will require that they use a new age estimation tool to verify that they’re over 13.</p><p>The platform is renaming Friends to Connections, and people can only use unfiltered text chat and the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/12/join-the-party-on-roblox">Party social feature</a> with a more exclusive group of “Trusted Connections.” The new age estimator tool prompts users to take a video selfie, “which is analyzed against a large and diverse dataset to estimate their age,” according to <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-commu%20nication">a blog post</a> from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman.</p><p>“If the system is not able to estimate the user’s age with high confidence, then the user’s age will remain unconfirmed and the user won’t be able to access Trusted Connections,” Kaufman says. If a user doesn’t pass the age estimation tool but they are actually over 13, they will be able to confirm their age via <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407282410644-Age-ID-Verification">ID verification</a> “and, in the future, verified parental consent.”</p><p>Roblox partnered with identity verification company Persona on the age estimation technology, Roblox’s Ryan Ebanks said in a call with reporters, and he says biometric data will be deleted 30 days after collection “except for a few exceptions where legally required.” Persona is “providing the core age estimation and ID verification services to Roblox,” spokesperson Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells <em>The Verge</em>, and “Persona’s model is integrated into the Roblox app with additional UI and logic that has been customized by Roblox.”</p><p>Users 13 through 17 who have their age confirmed will be able to add each other as Trusted Connections. Teens will only be able to add someone older than 18 as a Trusted Connection if they know them in real life, Kaufman says, and they can do that by scanning a QR code in person or using <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/7416652004884-Letting-Friends-Find-You-on-Roblox-with-Contact-Importer">Roblox’s Contact Importer feature</a>.</p><p>Although chats with Trusted Connections can be unfiltered, Roblox will monitor the conversations for “critical harm.”</p><p>“This includes, but isn’t limited to, any predatory behavior aimed at manipulating or harming minors, the sexualization of minors, engaging in inappropriate sexual conversations with or requesting sexual content, and any involvement with child sexual abuse material,” Chaitin-Lefcourt says.</p><p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> highlighted issues with predators on the platform, and the company introduced safety tools like letting parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">block and report</a> people on their child’s friend list and has banned kids under 13 from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">accessing “social hangout” spaces</a>. Age verification has growing momentum behind it — platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety">Reddit</a> also recently rolled out age verification tools in the UK to comply with the Online Safety Act, and the EU is testing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699151/eu-age-verification-app-dsa-enforcement">a prototype age verification app</a>.</p><p>Roblox is also introducing new features intended to support users’ well-being. A new option will let people control who sees whether they’re online. (Before, they could only hide which experience they were in.) Users can also set a Do Not Disturb timeframe to silence Roblox’s push notifications, and teens will be able to set their own screentime limits (a feature previously limited to parents).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708670/roblox-trusted-connections-age-estimation-privacy]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Julian LeFay, the father of The Elder Scrolls series, is leaving the video games industry following a terminal cancer diagnosis.</p>



<p><span>In a new message shared on YouTube, Victor Villarreal</span>, Creative Producer of The Wayward Realms, and<span> Ted Peterson,</span> co-founder of OnceLost Games confirmed that the father of one of the most popular RPG series still running today is leaving the gaming industry due to a terminal cancer diagnosis. The heartfelt message goes over how the two met, their work on The Elder Scrolls series, and how development of their new game continued even as Julian LeFay was battling cancer courageously, documenting his vision and concepts well to ensure the team was left with the resources needed to complete the game even beyond its Early Access build. We extend our best wishes to Julian LeFay and his loved ones, and our deepest respect to his legacy, which will not be forgotten by anyone who experienced the games he has worked on.</p>

<p>Julian LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after the company's creation in 1987, holding the role of Chief Engineer for many years before quitting the company for good in 1998. Among the games he has worked on, as already mentioned, are the first entries in The Elder Scrolls series, Arena and Daggerfall, as well as Battlespire. He also worked on the third entry in the series, Morrowind, as a contractor before leaving Bethesda. In 2019, he co-founded OnceLost Games with Ted Peterson, whose first game, The Wayward Realms, is a spiritual successor to Daggerfall.</p>

            <p>Ex-Elder Scrolls developer Julian LeFay has stepped away from his role as technical producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wayward-realms">The Wayward Realms</a> due to an ongoing battle with cancer taking a turn for the worse. OnceLost Games, the studio LeFay's been working with for the past few years, say they've been informed by his doctors that "his time with us is limited".</p>
<p>The developer's best known for his work on the first two Elder Scrolls games, Arena and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall">Daggerfall</a>, alongside The Wayward Realms creative director Ted Peterson. The pair gave <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-creators-reveal-how-accidental-plagiarism-was-part-of-its-origin-story">a talk together at 2024's GDC</a> delving into those early days at Bethesda, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">the RPG</a> they've been working on at OnceLost since 2019 is very much aiming to recapture Daggerfall's vibes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>OnceLost Games <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1945643058336600200">shared the news</a> of LeFay stepping away via a statement from Peterson and a YouTube video from Wayward Realms creative producer Victor Villarreal.</p>
<p>"Julian has been courageously battling cancer," reads Peterson's statement, "His doctors have informed us that his time with us is limited, and we are preparing to say goodbye to a true legend of the industry." It continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even in the face of this challenge, Julian’s dedication to The Wayward Realms and to all of you, our community, has never wavered. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that his vision for “The Grand RPG” will live on, but now Julian must step away from OnceLost Games for his health and to live his final moments surrounded by his loved ones.</p>
<p>Julian has complete faith in the ability of the team to bring the game he has envisioned to life for this incredible community. Anticipating this possibility, Julian has documented his vision and concepts well, ensuring the team is left with the resources needed to complete the game. The full game, beyond the Early Access build.</p>
<p>During this difficult time, we invite you to share your thoughts, prayers, well wishes, memories, or the impact Julian’s life and work have had on you. Your words of support mean more than you know, not just to Julian, but to all of us who have been privileged to work alongside him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Peterson closed out the statement by sharing something LeFay said during the most recent OnceLost team meeting he attended: "It is personal. And if it’s not personal, then you’re just doing work for hire and you’ll never have the motivation to accomplish a significant goal.”</p>
<p>As the team intended, the comments on the video are filling up with folks wishing LeFay well and sharing how his work's touched their lives. Villarreal reiterated that this is an eventuality OnceLost have been preparing for, and while LeFay's understandably their focus right now, they'll share "more details on how it affects the projects" in the future.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens]]></content:encoded>

Next year’s <em>Hoppers</em> has just released its first trailer, and it shows what looks like a delightful talk-to-the-animals movie. But will it be enough to rescue the studio after <em>Elio</em>’s box office bombing?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197586,197589" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I hope so! And from this first lighthearted teaser trailer (although, given this plays out like a regular trailer, I don’t think the word “teaser” has any meaning left at all), it sure looks like it deserves success. Pixar certainly thrives when it comes to meatier discourse, exploring complex emotions and relationships, but it’s hard to argue against the studio aiming for a more broad comedy.</p><p>The premise—a group of scientists create a device that allows a human mind to inhabit a mechanical animal so as to blend in and learn about their culture—is so blatantly lifted from <em>Avatar</em> that the opening of the teaser just flat-out acknowledges it. However, subject Mabel Tanaka gets into the body of a beaver and then refuses to leave, in order to help the local creatures battle an evil construction company set to destroy the local habitat.</p><p>The two-minute trailer shows lots of fun observation humor about animal life, based on Mabel’s sudden ability to understand what the other creatures are saying. It’s the sort of goofball territory I feel Pixar hasn’t reveled in since the days of <em>A Bug’s Life</em>, and I’m very happy to see it happening. However, I’m also pretty aware that this is perhaps considered Dreamworks’ territory—the rival animation house dominates the field with its <em>Madagascar</em> and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> franchises, and even the brief life of <em>Over the Hedge</em>. It’ll be interesting to see how that works out.</p><p><em>Hoppers</em> isn’t quite Pixars last chance—Enrico Casarosa’s (<em>Luca</em>) next animated feature <em>Gatto</em> is due for early summer 2027, featuring a black cat called Nero who befriends a Venetian graffiti artist while attempting to escape from the feline mob. That’s <em>quite</em> the pitch. <em>Luca</em>, sent straight to Disney+ during the pandemic, became a sleeper hit with a massive fanbase, so if Disney can figure out how to market <em>Gatto</em> to that audience—i.e. market it as if it were a sequel—it could fly.</p><p>Otherwise, it <em>is</em> just sequels. Pixar’s upcoming roster for the next few years includes <em>Toy Story 5</em>, <em>Incredibles 3</em>, and <em>Coco 2</em>, with <em>Inside Out 3</em> all but inevitable. But the reality is, their top-grossing movies all have at least a “2” in the title, with no original property ever hitting the all-important $1bn box office. However, the wise person might want to point out you cannot ever have any of those billion dollar sequels if you don’t have the first movie first! Hopefully someone at Disney can recognize this—even if <em>Hoppers</em> isn’t the all-consuming megahit they way, <em>Hoppers 2</em> very well could be.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The alleged risk of using a well-known <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> exploit is causing widespread confusion among the game's community, fuelled by a dire warning from a senior player that supposedly originates from the app's own development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said warning states that Pokémon Go's developers are aware of the exploit in question — which allows users to interact with in-game locations from further away than normally possible — and consider it "a violation of the Terms of Service of the game." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continued use of the exploit is detectable by the developer's anti-cheat teams, the warning goes on to claim, and risks users' accounts being flagged for cheating — an offense that can eventually result in a permanent account ban. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The appearance of this message, and the claim it is being passed on from Pokémon Go's makers, has sparked a firestorm of debate, primarily over the rights and (mostly) wrongs of this exploit being viewed as cheating in the same vein as more nefarious tactics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many players have said that this "trick" simply makes use of a unintended bug in how the game functions, and is not comparable to the tools some players use to actively break the game, such as by using third-party apps and hacks to spoof their location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a debate over the veracity of the message itself — both over its origins, which appear to be from a senior player marked as a Community Ambassador who has spoken to the game's developers, and over the likely intent behind what was said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand the nuances here, it's worth taking a look at the issue in more detail. At a base level, the exploit allows players to access a raid lobby slightly beyond their normal interaction radius via a Daily or Premium Raid Pass, rather than by using a more expensive Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performing the exploit — referred to locally among players as "flying," "floating," or "tricking" — is clearly not intended behavior, but can hardly be considered game-breaking. Accessing a raid lobby that's less than 100m away but slightly out of your normal range is considered by many players to simply be a convenience — and potentially an aid to taking part in more raids overall, even if this is done so without the top-tier Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a simple glance at the game's Terms of Service (TOS) shows that, according to the letter of the law, this could indeed fall under the game's description of cheating as it stands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN contacted the Pokémon Go development team to ask about the origins of the warning, whether the exploit was indeed considered cheating, and what actions players might expect if they continued to use it. In response, a spokesperson pointed us back to the game's <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/terms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOS document</a>, and specifically its section on cheating, which we'll quote below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible to see how this exploit <em>could </em>fall under the TOS' definition of using "techniques to alter or falsify a device's location" and therefore — again, according to the letter of the law — is something that <em>could </em>be considered cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by pointing IGN back to its TOS, the Pokémon Go development team is also — deliberately or not — highlighting something potentially crucial around this issue's enforcement. And that's the fact that, once again, according to the letter of the law, playing with multiple accounts is <em>also </em>considered cheating — despite it being something that a percentage of the game's playerbase does, with absolutely zero infraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this may all ultimately boil down to is someone purportedly asking the Pokémon Go development team for its view on an issue that the game's makers would obviously never sanction, but which seems unlikely to suddenly result in waves of players being banned. And yet, because of the murky origins of the warning, and because nuance can be difficult when messages get passed over the internet, players have now been left aggrieved and concerned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the exploit stick around in the game forever? It seems unlikely. Will players suddenly find themselves banned for using it while it's still possible? This seems unlikely too. But, we should state, this is just one reading of the situation, in lieu of any formal statement being provided — something which, if formalised, would likely only prompt the need for actual enforecement, which the majority of players seem to be against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sega has announced its forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds release will have the full game on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> card, unlike many other third-party titles on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set for release across other consoles and PC in September, including the original Switch. The Switch 2 version will arrive digitally during this year's holiday season, with the physical version launching "early 2026".</p>
<p>Many third-party publishers have drawn ire from players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">using Nintendo's game-key cards for Switch 2 games</a> - essentially containing a download key instead of the full game. That includes Sega's already-released Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>

<p>With Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, though, the company has u-turned. "The physical version will feature the full base game on the cartridge," it said in a press release.</p>
<p>The game will cost £64.99 on Switch 2 for the standard edition, and £79.99 for the digital deluxe edition. That compares to £54.99 on the original Switch.</p>
<p>There will also be an upgrade pack for original Switch users, which will carry over progression to the Switch 2 version. An <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq">FAQ</a> on the game's website states this will be $10 (Eurogamer has asked for clarification on UK pricing), matching the difference between the consoles.</p>
<p>The news was shared along with a new trailer for the game, showing off its customisation options. Players will be able to tweak their vehicles to amend stats and weapon combos (known as gadgets), with Sega boasting over 70,000 unique combinations will be possible.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will release across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC and original Switch on 25th September. The game's unique gimmick allows players to choose how tracks morph into others across each lap, hence its title. That extends to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">crossovers with other characters</a>, including Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from the Like A Dragon games, as well as vocaloid artist Hatsune Miku and Steve from Minecraft.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson stated the game "might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">most mechanically rich kart racer ever made</a>" after going hands-on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-buck-third-party-switch-2-trend-with-full-game-on-card]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Plenty of toilet humour"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Art of Play, Boat Rocker Media, and the BBC have announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danger_mouse">Danger Mouse</a> game based on the hit cartoon series from the '80s.</p>
<p>Scheduled for launch in <strong>2026</strong>, Danger Mouse will be a side-scrolling affair with 15 levels to work through. Co-op play will be available to include Penfold as a playable character, and the title is said to include "plenty of toilet humour", so we're definitely morbidly intrigued to see what that entails.</p>
<p>There's little else to note at the moment, but from the few screenshots available at the time of writing, the visuals actually look pretty cool; very faithful! We'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one in the coming months.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 15 Levels – Side-scrolling, arcade battle action, super danger-filled levels!<br>
- Team Up – As Danger Mouse and Penfold in cooperative multiplayer to take on the Baron’s evil epic do-overs!<br>
- Take Control – Of the iconic Mark IV to drive, dive, fly, and tap dance your way to victory again…!<br>
- Plenty of Toilet Humor – But no potty mouth. Just incredibly dangerous foes to battle all over the globe!<br>
- Time Wasters – Errr… um… We mean mini games. Yes. Mini games!</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Charlie Guillemot has addressed concerns of nepotism after being named co-CEO of Ubisoft's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded subsidiary, following in the footsteps of his father Yves Guillemot.</p>
<p>Ubisoft announced in March it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary with €1.16bn of investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>. This subsidiary will be the home of the company's biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>Now the company has named Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs. Derennes has spent over 35 years at Ubisoft, co-founded Ubisoft's Montreal studio in 1997, and most recently served as managing director for the company's North American output.</p>

<p>Charlie Guillemot, meanwhile, began his career in 2014 at Owlient, a studio acquired by Ubisoft. The studio's biggest release, mobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-elite-squad-shuts-down-a-year-after-launch">shut down a year after launch</a> having failed to find an audience. Before that, the game was embroiled in controversy following accusations of including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-pulls-black-lives-matter-raised-fist-from-new-tom-clancy-game-following-backlash">imagery promoting alt-right Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories</a>.</p>
<p>After this, Guillemot left Ubisoft to co-found <a href="https://www.unagi.games/">Unagi</a>, a company known for Web3 gaming, AI, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing its new subsidiary co-CEOs, Ubisoft stated: "Charlie Guillemot has built a hybrid career at the intersection of management and innovation. He brings an entrepreneurial perspective and a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. With a strong product mindset, deep tech culture, and a passion for games, he represents a new generation of leadership focused on innovation, quality, and putting players at the centre of decision-making."</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a>, Guillemot then directly addressed any concerns of nepotism, following in the footsteps of his father.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Yves' son," he said. "That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment."</p>
<p>He continued: "I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</p>
<p>"What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work."</p>
<p>In the same interview, the co-CEOs detailed how their roles will complement each other. Guillemot will be "in charge of the 'what'", focusing on creative direction and marketing of the company's brands. Derennes will be focused on production and technology - the "how".</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">interview published by Ubisoft</a>, the pair also spoke of opportunities for growth in the games industry today.</p>
<p>"The biggest difference today is that the market is stable, compared to the previous decades in which there were massive disruptions one after the other which brought big changes - I'm thinking of the new console releases and the arrival of online gaming, to name a few," said Guillemot. "Of course, generative AI and cloud are likely to revolutionise game creation and the player experience in the long term, but what really matters today is standing out. That means being able to offer high-quality content, and sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p>
<p>Derennes, meanwhile, spoke of expanding franchises beyond games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers final PC system requirements have been confirmed, and they are significantly lower than the previously known requirements, although with a caveat that doesn't bode too well.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the game's Steam store page, the game requires at least an Intel Core i5-8400/AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, 1 6GB RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB/AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB GPU. The recommended specifications aren't significantly higher than the minimum, as the developer recommends an Intel Core i7-9700/AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 16 GB RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070/AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT/INTEL Arc A750 GPU. These specifications, however, were tested with NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR enabled with no mention of target resolution or framerate, so it's impossible to say how well the game will run at any given resolution on these system configurations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>MINIMUM</strong>:<br>OS: Windows10 64bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400/AMD Ryzen 5 1600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB/AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 60 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: HDD Supported, SSD Recommended. The above specifications were tested with DLSS/FSR enabled.<br></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong>:<br>OS: Windows10/11 64bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700/AMD Ryzen 5 5500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070/AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT/INTEL Arc A750<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 60 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. The above specifications were tested with DLSS/FSR enabled.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As already mentioned, early WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers PC system requirements were shared a few months back, and the recommended specifications were much beefier, listing more powerful CPUs and GPUs and way more RAM than the updated system requirements shared today. You can check the previous requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-opens-pre-orders-and-shares-pc-specs-ahead-of-july-24-launch/">here.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on July 24. The game will also be added to the Xbox Game Pass library on day one.</p>

            <p>Virtuos, the company best known for working with other studios to deliver the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-remastered">Dark Souls Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, are reportedly preparing to lay off staff. 300 people are cited as being at risk.</p>
<p>That's according to reporting posted to Bluesky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">Gauthier Andres</a> of French outlet Origami. Andres' post dropped same day Virtuos lead game designer Adrien Jouannet appeared on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> livestream to talk about the studio's work with CD Projekt on the futuristic RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">latest update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Andres reports that 300 Virtuos staff are at risk of redundancy, or around 7% of the company's total staff. <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/about-us/">Virtuos' website</a> cites them as employing over 4200 people in total.</p>
<p>The report suggests these layoffs will primarily affect Virtuos' workers in China, but that staff in other regions of the world will also be hit, including at the French studios that worked with Bethesda on Oblivion Remastered. As of writing, Virtuos have studios based in 25 locations across the world, with five, including UK-based Third Kind Games and a new studio in South Korea, having been acquired by the company since the start of August 2024.

</span></p><p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-delivering on quality relative to the budget, and a contract without royalties (no bonuses tied to the game's success)," reads a translation of Andres' post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gauthier-andres-origami-mass-layoffs-are-currently-underway-at-virtuos-the-studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-and-the-upcoming-mgs-%CE%94-300-people.1245135/">on ResetEra</a> which closely matches a machine translation we've done, "The result: teams were pushed to their limits for a pure showcase project, with its profitability likely to be questioned."</p>
<p>It also asserts that working on the likes of Oblivion Remastered and Snake Eater were part of an effort by Virtuos to shift their strategy towards working on bigger projects or series, rather than lighter remakes. We've reached out to Virtuos for comment.</p>

            <p>Brendan and I once had a podcast conversation about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> in which we predicted that IO Interactive would be limited by James Bond's license holders MGM to a maximum of three toilet drownings, one fish spearing, and absolutely no duck explosions. While we can't yet confirm specifics, IO's franchise director Jonathan Lacaille has said that MGM were "a lot more daring than (the studio) thought" in a recent chat with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/">Very Gary Computing</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like they restricted IO very much at all, actually, aside from asking them not to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>'s Bond "a killing machine!". Lacaille actually credits Hitman's, um, restraint in helping them secure the license in the first place.</p>

<p>"In Hitman, you shoot maybe once per level, or not at all, sometimes," Lacaille says, which he thinks helped "open the conversation" with MGM. "If you get to shoot, you kind of fail the mission", he says later. I have been harping on about this forever re: Hitman's pointless amount of guns for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a>, and it is very nice to be vindicated.</p>
<p>This said, it sounds like First Light's Bond might be a bit more gung-ho anyway. Hitman is "a very patient game," Lacaille says, "versus First Light, the character - in a sense - is young and a bit reckless, and sometimes doesn’t have enough patience". Which lines up with earlier comments about IO's Bond being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">"more reckless"</a> than Ian Hitman.</p>
<p>"If the other game is more methodical," he continues, "this one will be more about making you think fast under pressure, giving you a lot of options and you have to think – right, or left, or do you take all these guards? Do you blow your cover? We bring you forward all the time. So in that sense, the game is probably not as open".</p>
<p>But the game will open up more "when it makes sense to," says Lacaille. "When we want to make an homage to what the franchise is about, which is sometimes very big stunts and cinematic moments".</p>
<p>First Light is set for release next year, but IO have already spoken about the potential to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">spin out a trilogy</a> from the game, as well as hinting toward Hitman-style<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-sounds-like-itll-be-getting-hitman-style-post-launch-missions-but-with-more-actiony-things"> post-launch missions</a>, possibly with all the pisser drownings my awful heart could desire.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-bonds-license-holders-let-io-be-a-lot-more-daring-than-the-hitman-studio-thought]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Virtuos - the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">this year's successful The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and whose staff have also worked on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-23-update-wants-you-to-relax-and-take-in-the-night-city-sights-with-new-self-driving-cars">recently announced Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as well as serving as a support studio for the anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> - has reportedly been impacted by layoffs.</p>
<p>According to a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">BlueSky by Gauthier Andres</a>, a reporter for the French-language publication Origami, seven percent of the company's workforce will be subject to layoffs. That's 300 people.</p>
<p>These layoffs will allegedly be across the United States, Asia, Europe, and three branches in France. Andres' sources said the initial layoffs will affect those in China.</p>

<p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-spending on quality and a royalty-free contract (without bonuses tied to the game's success)," Andres wrote (via machine translation). "The result: teams put under severe strain for a purely showcase game, whose profitability is doomed to be questioned."</p>
<p>The company reportedly put a freeze on raises and reduction on bonuses back in February of this year. This move led to questions regarding layoffs from staff to Virtuos' management. As a result, Andres said a strike is taking place at Virtuos Lyon, which will protest the layoffs and aim to "protect the future capacity of the branch".</p>
<p>According to sources, Virtuos is also making a move towards the use of generative AI. "In one year, we've gone from a few group-level presentations to basic but mandatory training for employees," Andres was told.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Virtuos for comment on the report.</p>
<p>Layoffs have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">a depressingly regular</a> story in the video games industry over the past few years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">Microsoft began another round of layoffs at the company impacting in excess of 9000 people</a>. This saw games cancelled and studios closed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-one-of-2025s-biggest-hits-subject-to-mass-layoffs-report]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team behind the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie sequel - aptly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> - has released a new teaser for the film, with a certain Mr Johnny Cage taking centre stage (poetry!).</p>
<p>The teaser itself is called Uncaged Fury, and sees Karl Urban's Johnny Cage taking on a load of would-be assailants by whacking them all with pipes and leaping around in a rather athletic way. This leaping includes him jumping over a recently launched Bazooka missile, which despite being aimed at the ground manages to miss Johnny and hit… actually, I won't say, because you really do have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>You can check out the new teaser trailer for Mortal Kombat 2 below.</p>

<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it boring.</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-trailer-sees-johnny-cage-jumping-over-a-bazooka-missile-with-some-very-wide-legs]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Imagine your perfect island retreat. Perhaps there’s white sandy beaches, possibly lush green forests, or maybe mountainous terrain is more your jam. Now imagine a quaint town, with fountains on every corner and houses built straight into the cliff-face. You head to the harbour to watch the fishing boats and look out to the picturesque horizon. Feel more chilled? Me too.</p>
<p>No, you haven’t just fallen into a relaxation exercise hosted by your court-appointed therapist because you went too far with your road rage. Again. This is Islanders: New Shores.</p>
<p><iframe title="ISLANDERS: New Shores | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3hCDB-29iI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Islanders: New Shores claims to be a minimalist city-building game, but I’d argue this description is too simple in its own right, because there’s nothing minimal about the joy this relaxing game brings to the player. The gameplay is gloriously simple and beautifully accessible, not needing to mess around with complex menus and long-winded tutorials. Dropping you straight into the first of twenty levels, you receive a quick overview of the basics of camera movement and placing buildings and you’re off.</p>
<p>As the levels progress, you unlock new and exciting buildings to add to your island. Each new building has its own specific placement requirements, including variations in height, light levels, nature and accompanying buildings. It’s easy to get the hang of which buildings go where to rack up the most points. Plus, the more points you gain, the more boons you unlock to help you on your paradise-building adventure.</p>


<p>Even though Islanders: New Shores is a score-based game, it feels in no way competitive. You find you want to rack up more points because then you get to keep on playing. Because Islanders: New Shores is addictively relaxing. And if the point-scoring feels like it gets in the way of you achieving your chillest form, there’s a tranquil sandbox mode to potter around in too.</p>
<p>So how does Islanders: New Shores manage to be so darn soothing? The original soundtrack sets the mood with peaceful vibes for you to unwind to. Plus, the gameplay visuals truly are stunning. The combinations of vibrant colours are serene and dreamlike, the building designs intricately detailed. It’s important to also mention the islands themselves. With each new level, the player gets to choose which island and feature they’d like to play with next, but even if the basic features are similar, you’ll never see the same island twice. New layouts and landscapes keep each level fresh and interesting.</p>
<p>The same goes for the buildings. The more of each structure you place, the more variants you’ll get to see. Each new harbour has different boats in it. Each new mansion has a different rooftop configuration. For some structures, like the houses, seaweed farms and platforms, the game provides you with different building shapes and encourages you to slot them together, tetris-style, to maximise your points. The game guides you by clearly marking when your building can or can’t fit into certain spaces and displaying the score you’ll gain – or lose – when you set it down. Choose wisely, because there’s no moving your buildings after the fact and hitting “undo” too much can reduce your score multiplier at the end of the level. This can be a bit tricksy, especially when the subtlety of the selection highlight occasionally makes it unclear as to what you’re going to come out with once you’ve tapped your controller button.</p>

<p>You would think with the requirement for jigsaw-puzzle precision placement you need to be able to get in real close to slot your buildings in with accuracy to maximise your score. Sadly, the zoom option can be a little hit and miss at times. The taller your island, the less you’ll be able to see of the items you place closer to sea level. This is a real shame because the intricate details of the building designs deserve to be admired up close and personal.</p>
<p>So now you know, Islanders: New Shores is so much more than just a minimalist city-building game. The radiant visuals and atmospheric soundtrack add a sense of tranquillity to this easily accessible and relaxingly straightforward paradise-builder.</p>

<p>What a find!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pikachu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b9699422f05d/pikachu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's amazing what you can find in the bottom of a bin sometimes, right? Not that we frequently go scurrying around in trash, you understand... But y'know, there are definitely occasions when something rare and potentially very valuable has been unknowingly thrown away.</p>
<p>Case in point, Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElbowDeepInElmo/">ElbowDeepInElmo</a> (lovely...) has posted images of a Pikachu statue that they state was rescued from the trash by a printing company responsible for the early runs of Pokémon cards (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pikachu-statue-that-was-salvaged-from-the-trash-turns-out-to-be-official-promotional-material-from-1999-us-premiere-of-pokemon-the-first-movie/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>According to the poster, it's not just any statue, but rather a piece of promotional material that was used for <strong>Pokémon: The First Movie</strong> when the film had its premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in 1999.</p>

<p>The Pikachu is sadly missing its tail, which was likely thrown away at the same time as the main statue itself, but the poster is hoping to have a replacement tail 3D printed to make the statue complete once again.</p>
<p>It's also been made clear that the statue is not currently for sale or trade at the time of writing. We reckon it might be worth quite a bit at this point, mind you, even if it is missing its tail.</p>
<p>You can <em>just about</em> see the statue in the archival footage from the premiere below, which in itself is a wild trip down memory lane, even if you weren't there yourself. Ah, those were the days...</p>

<p><em>What do you make of this extraordinary find? Have you got any rare or interesting Pokémon merchandise or promotional material from back in the day? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>

Chinese action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is out in a week, and it's high time we heard about the system requirements, which don't seem that high for a game in which you can lob lightning at supersized peacocks and leave a delicate furrow through new-fallen snow.</p>
<p>An Intel Core i5-8400, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, 16GB of RAM and 60GB's worth of SSD are all they're asking for the chance to become an amnesiac pirate swordswoman during the age of the Ming dynasty, tasked with murdering a whole lot of bird people before she becomes a bird person herself.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
We have not covered Wuchang since 2021, when Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-looks-like-a-chinese-take-on-bloodborne">pronounced it a Chinese Bloodborne</a>, with the requisite lamentation that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> still isn't on PC. Little birds tell me that developers Leenzee have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-brings-color-to-the-muted-soulslike-genre">tweaked the visuals since then</a> to make the game's setting, Shu, less redolent of Yharnam. Still, parallels abound. As in From Software's game, Shu is subject to a monstrous plague: in this case, it gives everybody feathers. The result is not a realm of jovial bluetit shopkeepers plus the occasional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)">sobbing mutant Natalie Portman</a>, but a place of bossfights and upgrades. Here's a trailer to catch you up.

Playing as Wuchang, the titular pirate lady, you must rediscover your own past while trying to stave off the Feathering disease. You can use "Red Mercury" to unlock new techniques - guessing it comes from bodies, not pharmacies - and enchant a variety of weapons to inflict escalating grades of buttkick. "As you piece together Wuchang's lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings - each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/">the Steam page comments</a>.

<p>Chaser: the Nvidia hardware above makes use of DLSS 4. If you're not hip to such jargon, don't panic, because I know somebody who is. Here's our hardware editor James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">Nvidia DLSS 4 explainer</a>.</p>
<p>
Chaser 2: If <em>you</em> had to turn into a bird monster, what kind would you prefer? I used to have a thing for albatrosses, with their ginormous wings. They can stay aloft for weeks, allegedly, sleeping in mid-air. No idea whether they're good at parrying, but they should have decent reach.</p>
<p>Also, while we're talking boids, what's the best collective noun for a group of soulslikes? A host? A covert? A murder? OK, I'll shut up now. Wuchang launches on 24th July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bird-bashing-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-some-pc-system-specs-and-they-are-not-brutal]]></content:encoded>

A standalone expansion to 2023’s entertainingly authentic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business takes Robo’s relentless rampage off the scum-riddled streets of Old Detroit and up through the heavily guarded heights of OMNI Tower in an all-new, 10-hour killing spree. The bad news is that with precious few new weapons and enemy types, the action of Unfinished Business never really elevates enough to match the skyward trajectory of its setting or distinguish itself as little more than a replay of the original. There’s still plenty of ultra violence to indulge in here, but it’s a form of mindless fun that’s as familiar as it is ferocious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not unlike the 2012 sci-fi splatterfest movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dredd-3d">Dredd</a>, the action of Unfinished Business is contained almost entirely within the one highrise building and sees RoboCop making his way from the ground floor to its upper reaches in search of some stolen OCP equipment. It borrows a bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> as well, since Robo is initially led along by an anonymous assistant on the other end of a two-way radio, and that helps to lend a welcome air of mystery to the story’s opening half – even if it doesn’t eventually pay off with any shocking plot twists like Irrational Games’ underwater classic.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As was the case with the previous game, the success of Unfinished Business’ storytelling largely hinges on the often hilarious deadpan delivery of original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/robocop">RoboCop</a> actor Peter Weller in the main role. Whether he’s repeating iconic lines from the movies or making subtle mockery of almost everyone he meets, Weller’s performance is a noticeable cut above the rest. Admittedly, that’s not a super high bar to clear since the supporting cast often sound like they’re voiced by hastily dashed-out placeholder recordings someone forgot to fill in with the real ones, and each seem to draw from the same shallow pool of character heads, making it tough to really distinguish one from the other. In the end, I was happy to go along for the ride all the way to Unfinished Business’ bullet-riddled gore-gasm of a climax, in spite of the fact that I didn’t particularly feel compelled to focus on anyone other than the scumbags standing squarely in front of my ironsights.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Business As Usual</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the story, though, Unfinished Business is a fairly flat 10 hours because while it increases the amount of bad guys you have to shoot, it doesn’t do nearly enough to expand the variety of ways you do it. If you’ve played 2023’s Rogue City, then you’ve already experienced the bulk of what Unfinished Business’ combat has to offer. Once again, you’re able to ricochet bullets off walls to stylishly snipe enemies hidden behind cover, perform breach-and-clears on almost every door you come across in bloodsplattered slow-motion, and shoot explosive barrel after explosive barrel as you RoboStop and RoboDrop absolutely every criminal you come across. It’s all presented with the same fan-pleasing flair, from the green Apple IIe-like graphics of Robo’s heads-up display to the iconic theme music that swells along with the increasing enemy numbers, and that certainly still goes a long way. It’s just a shame to see the skill and Auto 9 upgrade systems copied across seemingly unchanged. You unlock the exact same perks like armour-piercing rounds and the ability to automatically deflect incoming enemy fire, just a little faster this time thanks to the story’s shorter runtime. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve played 2023’s Rogue City, then you’ve already experienced the bulk of what Unfinished Business’ combat has to offer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a handful of new mechanical enemy types to contend with at least, though none of them really shake things up to a dramatic degree. I did find myself making more consistent use of Robo’s returning slow-mo skill in order to combat the fast-moving robobombs that rapidly roll towards you, as well as the swarms of flying security drones that dart unpredictably through the air above. But while the nimble killbots that cartwheel around the place seem threatening at first blush, they quickly prove to be about as resilient as a jar of baby food as I either shattered their robot skulls with a quick burst of bullets or simply picked them up and disposed of them like katana-wielding Kleenexes, even on the hardest difficulty setting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">OMNI Tower itself does offer the occasional interesting space to host the slaughter in, from the vibrant video arcade and cinema found in the relaxation zone to the trashbag-strewn underbelly of waste management (complete with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope">Star Wars</a>-style trash compactor to frantically blast your way out of). Those are the exception, though, and most of the carnage takes place in the charmless concrete corridors in between. That’s to be expected from a tour through a corporate dystopia, sure, but it doesn’t make for a lot of fun surprises. Despite the striking gallery of gore and particle effects that shower over each firefight, there were times that Unfinished Business’ drab interiors made it feel less like a thrilling action adventure and more like wandering in circles through a shopping mall carpark trying to work out where I left my 6000 SUX. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the biggest problem I had with Unfinished Business’ gunplay was the same one I found with 2023’s Rogue City. That is, Robo’s signature Auto 9 – blessed as it is with unlimited ammo, easily upgradeable attributes, and an undeniable cool factor – makes the dozens of other firearms found throughout the campaign almost entirely redundant. It’s just so overequipped to deal with everything that’s thrown your way that I never found a good enough reason to holster it. It would be akin to a Star Wars adventure in which you default to the use of a lightsaber – you’re probably not ever going to clip it to your belt and pick up a Tusken Raider’s gaffi stick to crack heads with instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one exception: the cryo cannon that’s introduced in the second half proved to be worth a few charged-up trigger squeezes, especially since its sub-zero rounds turn your targets into instant ice sculptures that can be subsequently shattered like the T-1000. That’s a time-honored video game tradition that dates back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/duke-nukem-3d">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. But otherwise I almost never felt the need to bend over and grab any other dropped firearms – and not just because Robo appears to have the knee joints of an 80-year-old man (as well as the voice of a 78-year-old). <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span>  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Murphy’s Law</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfinished Business’ structure is effectively built around a cycle of using your Auto 9 to deep-six hordes of mercenaries, pausing to settle disputes between citizens in side missions that veer from moderately humorous to completely banal, and then flicking some switches and turning valves in its basic puzzle sections to open the path ahead before resuming the unrelenting blaze of glorious gore. There are only a handful of detours along the way that at least try to mix up the otherwise predictable pacing, with varying degrees of success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one flashback mission we get to pull on the kevlar-lined vest of Alex Murphy in his pre-RoboCop days, as he and his fellow officers are dispatched to investigate the whereabouts of some known perps. I enjoyed this small glimpse of Murphy’s origins in the Metro South precinct even if the stilted banter between his squad was more than a little wide of the mark, and there were some fun Easter eggs to find here including a memo that referenced the ominous rise of a new criminal on the scene that I won't spoil here. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the setting of this sequence lacks imagination given that its abandoned mill surroundings are a bit too similar to the site of Murphy’s infamous ‘crucifixion’ scene witnessed in the first film, and its combat feels somewhat topsy turvy. Where RoboCop must scramble to find OCP charges in order to replenish his rapidly depleting health, regular flesh-and-bone Murphy somehow magically regains it in between shootouts. That’s typical for a lot of first-person shooters, but it’s less of a contrast to playing as a walking tank than I’d been expecting. On the flipside, Murphy can only wield his boring old service pistol, which is frustrating because this was one of the few times I actually wanted to pick up a gun I found but couldn’t. It all makes for a diversion that’s important to the plot, but not particularly compelling to play.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[RoboCop] always seems to be lit with ambient neon lights like he’s emerging out of the driver’s side of a Ford Taurus on the poster for the 1987 film. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the same can’t be said for the late-game level where you get to pilot an ED-209 mech. This fabulously frenetic stretch of fan service allows you to use twin arm cannons to shred through each hapless human like they’re that one poor bastard executive that probably should have hid in the bathroom during the original ED-209 demonstration, blast through concrete walls with rocket barrages, and even trample over a model of Old Detroit’s skyline while battling rival robots like you’re revelling in a small-scale clash of Kaiju. Sure, it’s perhaps not as cathartic as it could have been given that by that point I’d already very efficiently turned hundreds of mercenaries into mincemeat with Robo’s Auto 9. But I can’t pretend I wasn’t grinning like an idiot through the entire sequence, which ratchets up the carnage to ludicrous levels and doesn’t linger long enough to outstay the welcome of playing as a near-invincible killing machine.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>Trigger warning!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I never got tired of seeing RoboCop himself onscreen either. As was the case with the previous game, his polished steel armour looks absolutely spot-on and he always seems to be lit with ambient neon lights like he’s emerging out of the driver’s side of a Ford Taurus on the poster for the 1987 film. That said, outside of the smooth lines of Robo’s movie-accurate character model there’s a noticeable roughness to Unfinished Business, at least on the PlayStation 5 version that I played. During my time with it I suffered frame rate dips, audio dropouts, animation glitches, dodgy lip syncing, ridiculous moon physics during slow-motion breaches, characters disappearing completely during finishing moves and story cutscenes, and even the occasional crash to the home screen. After a while I started to wonder if the “Unfinished Business” title was a nod to RoboCop’s everlasting quest for justice or merely a reference to the launch state of the game itself. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">As someone who delighted in blasting through the original RoboCop: Rogue City, my hopes for this standalone Unfinished Business expansion were higher than a junkie on Nuke. However, outside of the exhilarating playable cameo from ED-209, there’s really not enough new here to make another 10 hours as everyone’s favourite baby food-slurping supercop worth going out of your way for. Peter Weller’s deadpan delivery is as endearing as ever, and the cryo gun is an icy blast (though ironically still not quite as cool to use as the Auto 9), but the supporting cast of characters is seriously shoddy and the raft of performance issues on PlayStation 5 make for a bumpier ride than accelerating up the exit ramp from the Metro West carpark. If you thirst for some more Auto 9 bursts flourished with TJ Lazer-inspired twirls then RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business will certainly scratch the itch on your trigger finger, but it’s far from the future of law enforcement. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Osprey Games has announced <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition. Celebrating the game's 10th anniversary, this limited printing of the fantasy skirmish miniatures game brings high-quality materials and the most comprehensive version of the game's rules.</p>

<h2>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition is a solid gift for both newcomers and veterans to designer Joseph A. McCullough's award-winning skirmish miniatures game. It is a leatherette-bound copy of the second edition of the core rulebook embossed with the silver-foiled logo. In addition, it is protected in a slipcase with twin book ribbons, ensuring the book is built to last.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-book-banner.jpg?itok=TzJSETB0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-book-banner.jpg?itok=lqGXptMY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Notably, this copy of the game includes rules for its rarest, most mysterious artifact. Yes, this book contains rules for the Ring of Transference. This is notable because prior printings of the game contained the item in the rulebook, but no rules or mechanics. If you don't like hunting down errata, this book helpfully provides.</p>

<p>Frostgrave takes place within the frozen ruins of the ancient city of Felstad. Each player takes on the role of a wizard specializing in one of ten schools of magic, as well as a band of followers. These followers then duke it out in elaborate wizard duels and fights. All so one arcane scholar can learn the secrets of the city's long-lost empire.</p>

<p>The game won several awards in 2016. Those honors include Best Miniatures Game at UK Expo 2015, a 2016 Silver Ennie for Best Miniature Product of the Year, and Best Miniatures Game award at Beasts of War 2015. It is a miniature-agnostic game, which makes it considerably cheaper to get into compared to the money sinks of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition will be available exclusively on Osprey Games' website. The book is set to ship out on November 18 in the United States and on November 20 in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"When our fathers stood against the Persians," spake Greek statesman and general Pericles, "they had no such resources as we have now". Time, of course, muddies the clear waters of specifics, but I'm basically sure he was talking about the ability for each of his men to keep a thirty foot ladder snuggled safely away in their rectal passage just in case they encountered any massive walls.</p>
<p>Which is probably where Total War got the idea from. Since launch, The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> series has given each troop, from the lowliest Chaos Chosen to the bravest and most beautiful ratman, the ability to magic a ladder from nowhere during sieges. There's a<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3425174065"> mod for Total War: Warhammer 3 that removes them</a>, but now the end of arse ladders is getting official support, including tweaks to hopefully teach the AI how to behave without them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Joining the ladder changes is a rebalance to siege equipment, and the first of many planned settlement layout reworks. All this comes courtesy of a new Proving Grounds beta, as detailed by battle team lead Milcho Vasilev in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/76-total-war-warhammer-iii-siege-proving-grounds">a new blog</a>. Proving grounds means the changes will only exist in a separate beta branch for a bit, and likely won't go live until players have had a chance to test them and give feedback for iteration.</p>
<p>A bit more detail on the arse ladders. The bung rungs, if you will. The scaffolds that chaff-old. First up, you will be able to toggle your intestinal escalades back on if you wish. No judgement. Something's up there that long, starts to feel like a part of you. Secondly, CA say they've "fixed over 50 issues related to how the Battle AI plays" in sieges in general, so they might now have some devious new ideas of how to cope without the ladders.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, towers are getting their range reduced but their damage buffed, and gates will be more durable. You'll be able to build siege towers and battering rams quicker, and their speed and durability has been adjusted. "In addition," reads the blog, "we are changing the way Siege Attrition works and turning it into a linear progression making it be stronger and stronger with each consecutive turn a settlement remains under siege".</p>
<p>Do have a read of the blog for the full breakdown. This beta round runs for two weeks, from the 24th of July to the 7th of August. There'll also be a livestream with Vasilev on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/totalwar">Twitch</a> today at  3:30PM BST/2:20PM UTC/4:30PM CEST. I don't think they've done a dev stream for a while, and I'm a sucker for the nitty gritty stuff they've been sharing more of recently. Rest in pelvic prolapse, arse ladders.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-total-war-warhammers-arse-ladders-2016-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has added a Black Library logo to its official Big Summer Warhammer Preview showcase, sparking speculation the company may announce new novels that finally move the overarching Warhammer 40,000 narrative forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Summer Warhammer Preview, set for this Friday, July 18, will contain reveals for Games Workshop’s main tabletop games, including Age of Sigmar, The Horus Heresy, and of course Warhammer 40,000. Its initially released digital poster for the event did not feature the logo for Black Library, Games Workshop’s in-house book publishing division. However, on July 16, it released a new version of this poster with the Black Library logo added, sparking speculation that fans will get new novel announcements as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/517658642-1124351393077178-5591934164739581769-n-1752732406910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Black Library logo suggests new novel reveals. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is this exciting for fans of the setting? There is a great deal of speculation that Games Workshop may finally be ready to move the Warhammer 40,000 narrative forward with either a brand new series of books, the teased meet-up between two returned primarchs, or the long-awaited third book in Dan Abnett's Bequin trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be">IGN has reported on the now mythical Pandemonium before</a>, when fans speculated its delay might have something to do with Games Workshop and Amazon getting their narrative ducks in a row ahead of the Henry Cavill-fronted Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. It is perhaps the most-anticipated book in all Warhammer fandom. The first novel in the Bequin series, Pariah, came out in 2012. Its sequel, the Warhammer 40,000 lore treasure trove that is Penitent, followed nearly a decade later, in March 2021. Pandemonium does not have a release date, and the wait for an announcement is fast becoming Warhammer 40,000’s version of George R. R. Martin’s M.I.A. Game of Thrones book, The Winds of Winter. Some fans are speculating — perhaps more with hope than expectation — that now is finally the time for a Pandemonium reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's heightened interest in Pandemonium because it promises to actually move the overarching Warhammer 40,000 plot forward. Penitent ended with a significant lore revelation (it has to do with the identity of the mysterious King in Yellow, which we won’t spoil here), and so the ramifications of Pandemonium for the wider Warhammer 40,000 universe could be huge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps more realistic is a new novel series set during the period known as The Scouring. This is the largely unexplored time in Warhammer 40,000 history when the Imperium ran down the traitor legions following the defeat of Horus 10,000 years before the current setting. With the Horus Heresy seemingly wrapped up following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature">Era of Ruin</a>, The Scouring seems like a natural next step for Games Workshop if it wants to continue filling in the gaps in the Warhammer 40,000 narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or this may all be much ado about nothing, and Black Library’s presence at the show ultimately goes down as a disappointment. You’d like to think that Games Workshop knew what it would do to fan expectations by slapping the Black Library logo on its preview poster, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me neatly into why Warhammer 40,000 lore fans get excited by teases like this in the first place. As I’ve reported before, the Warhammer 40,000 story, such as it is, is a slow moving beast. The scribes at Games Workshop sometimes take years to inch the overarching plot forward. Take, for example, the return of beloved primarch, Lion El'Jonson, which was announced in March 2023. Now, over two years later, the character is yet to do much of anything in the setting, his hotly anticipated reunion with his brother, Roboute Guilliman, seemingly further away than ever. Could a new novel finally detail this sure to be spicy meet up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe, on Friday, we’ll finally get some answers. The Big Summer Warhammer Preview is set for 7pm BST / 11am PDT on Friday, July 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>It's showtime in 'Uncaged Fury'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Mortal Kombat II movie hype train is about to leave the station, with Warner Bros. today releasing a teaser tied to the upcoming action movie, which is arriving in cinemas on <strong>24th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's actually an "in-universe film trailer" for 'Uncaged Fury' starring Johnny Cage, who is played by The Boys superstar Karl Urban. Here's the description <a href="https://youtu.be/Sccu5MKUfuA">via IGN</a>. And just a word of warning, there is some swearing and a rude gesture (Johnny flipping the bird) in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Uncaged Fury sees the legendary Johnny Cage take on a band of goons with ease, making use of pipes, fast-paced combat skills, and an aura unlike any other."</p>
</blockquote>
