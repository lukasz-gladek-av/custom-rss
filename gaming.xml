            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Has it really been 25 years? Yes, my wizened friends, it has. Back in the year of our lord 2000 (or 1999 if you're from Japan), if you weren't still calming down from the trauma of Y2K (still can't believe nothing happened) you may have been getting completely sucked into one of the few truly amazing RPGs on the Nintendo 64. Because <em>you</em> are a person of lordly caliber. A top of the range model. No skimping on the quality ingredients in your sauce, champ.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/ogre_battle_64_person_of_lordly_caliber">Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber</a>, besides having a belter of a name, is also a game that had me — and I'm sure plenty more ancient N64 gamers besides — glued to my CRT screen when I should have been down the club dancing to...well, an S Club 7 remix or something.</p>
<p>This real-time strategy classic from Quest (who dissolved into Square Enix in 2003) sees players descend on the Holy Lodis Empire, where a bunch of bad guys are oppressing the people. It's up to you, through some delightful battling, to raise the revolutionary flag and fight back for the good of the people. Hey, we should try doing that in real life sometime!</p>

<p>The N64 had precious few outstanding RPG experiences of this type for players to enjoy, and certainly in comparison to other consoles of the time, so it's a good thing that Quest hit it so far out of the park we ended up giving it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/n64/ogre_battle_64_person_of_lordly_caliber">a 10/10 here at Nintendo Life</a>. Heck that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/03/ogre_battle_the_march_of_the_black_queen_virtual_console">one more than we scored</a> the first game, 1993's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ogre_battle_the_march_of_the_black_queen">Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/tactics_ogre_let_us_cling_together">same score</a> we gave the legendary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/tactics_ogre_let_us_cling_together">Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</a> (both reviews for the Virtual Console versions, of course).</p>
<p>There's a quality mix here of a top-notch story and a battle setup that excels. In fact, having sat through a few hours to get reacquainted with it recently, it really does remain highly playable and enjoyable today, even if it does look and sound distinctly of, well, the Nintendo 64 era. Maybe that's a good thing!</p>
<p>For an adventure that includes no voice-acting (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010330072003/http://www.nintendo.com/n64/ogrebattle3/index.html">according to Nintendo</a>, it was already the second-biggest N64 game, so it's lucky they didn't try to squeeze that in) whilst presenting its surprisingly affecting story entirely in-game rather than through naff cutscenes, Ogre Battle 64 excels because it makes the clever decision at the offset to remain grounded. Well, as grounded as something called Ogre Battle can be; its story is still relevant today, focusing on politics and issues that still affect us. It's immediate, it gets to the point and it underscores the action perfectly.</p>
<p>Taking place in the mining colony of Palatinus, the game tells the tale of people who've been abused and set to work in terrible conditions to the point that they finally rebel against the empire that's keeping them down. Magnus (that's the fella you play as) is initially dispatched as part of a force sent to quell revolutionary disturbances. But things don't exactly go to the Military's plan...</p>

<p>From here there are twists and turns aplenty to keep you involved, and it's surprising to see just how well-handled some of the more difficult topics are. The story keeps things real and they aren't glazed over, providing an emotional core that keeps it all ticking along very nicely.</p>
<p>All of this is tied to cracking battles of the Ogre Battle variety. The real-time scraps here involve sending out your dinky little troops (up to 50 men, women and beasts in total by the end), made up of the usual array of classes, to locations to gather up treasure, take over settlements and fight as they go. You arrange your selection of troops into a unit or "legion" placing class-types that work best at the front and back in suitable positions and so on and assigning a leader. These legions will then scrap against enemy groups.</p>
<p>Once you've been given your orders at the start of each mission, you'll set out to achieve an objective, and the game is quite free-wheeling in letting you get to this your own way. Battles kick off as and when you happen upon foes, the action plays out automatically, and it's up to you to ensure that you have your units in a setup that gives them the best chance to come out on top.</p>

<p>There's a lot of depth here, with loads of moves and skills to use against your opponents; you don't even necessarily have to physically defeat the enemy, just do enough to push them back and stop them gaining any ground, as you work to take over strongholds and dominate the map you are on by assuming control of towns and such forth. The fact that the battles are real-time helps add a frisson of urgency, and you can feel the desperation as you struggle to keep things moving your way. This is all then strengthened further by a clever 'Alignment' system, where your decisions and actions determine what ending of three you get to see.</p>
<p>Are you a man of honour who lets a defeated enemy live, or are you a bit of a bloodthirsty bad'un? Alignment goes so far as to affect the towns and settlements that you take over, as each one has its own set alignment rating. Match this and you'll be considered to have liberated the peoples there, rather than just having captured them all by force.</p>

<p>This adds plenty of replayability and considered thought processes to proceedings, especially for folks who get properly into the story. And get into it you should, because, besides the fun fighting, it's really the story and its handling of political matters that keeps this one up top as an all-timer. Ogre Battle 64 doesn't shy away from things; it's willing to have you question morals, and as a result it's got much more to say politically than plenty of modern efforts seem bothered with.</p>
<p>Is it still worth a playthrough today? Absolutely. If you can get over the slightly weathered looks and underwhelming sounds, there's plenty to recommend here, with engaging gameplay and a narrative that gets the old revolutionary blood pumping. Not that you'd need much help with that these days, most likely.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-brings-new-storyline-and-more-later-this-month.1318843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games have announced the first major&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>Early Access update, and it's coming to the tabletop adaptation later this month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Awakening Protocol update will serve as the first big content patch for the strategy RPG. Much of what it's bringing was first teased as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">roadmap announcement</a> back in early September.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting a new storyline in the form of the Unfettered arc, which will give you a chance to confront a "machine uprising" headed by a "mysterious and formidable leader".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-machine-uprising.jpg?itok=27OZZlwK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-machine-uprising.jpg?itok=IEsVKu4u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frosthaven</em>'s first major Early Access update will have you challenging a machine uprising.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the new storyline (about which Arc and Snapshot are remaining very tight-lipped for now), you can also expect three new playable heroes to be added to&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>in the Awakening Protocol update, and they come with "bold new strategies".</p>

<p>Five new bosses are coming as well, consisting of "mechanical and unknown horrors", so you'll need to make sure your squad is at its strongest if you want to beat them. That's in addition to over 18 new quests, a new building, and lots of other extras.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-video-game-adaptation-announced" rel="nofollow">video game adaptation</a> of the popular tabletop experience, which is itself a sequel to the iconic RPG&nbsp;<em>Gloomhaven</em>. For a time,&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frosthaven-kickstarter-is-most-funded-board-game-on-platform" rel="nofollow">most-funded tabletop project</a> on Kickstarter, before being overtaken by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">Brandon Sanderson's&nbsp;<em>Cosmere&nbsp;</em>RPG project</a>.</p>

<p>The video game version of&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>promises "challenging yet satisfying gameplay" across both its single-player and multiplayer offerings, as well as "deep mechanics" that should feel intuitive to both newcomers and experienced veterans of the tabletop game.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347080/Frosthaven/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and its Awakening Protocol update launches on October 23rd.

            <p>The world is insufficiently clean and sparkly, so here comes Futurlab with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2">Powerwash Simulator 2</a>. The floor-mopping bonanza will release on 23rd October, a few short weeks from now. The release date announcement accompanies one of those satirical "corporate training" videos, commonly used by videogame creators to sneer indirectly at the sad unfortunates trapped in their Skinner boxes. 
</p>
<p>The trailer comments of the sequel's new cleaning tools, for example, that "it all does basically the same thing, but it gives you a false sense of progression, even though you've really achieved nothing". Fine then, Futurlab. I was looking forward to your glorified adult colouring book. I was modestly anticipating the opportunity to absent myself from my personal squalor and while away some hours in your pseudo-therapeutic tribute to Mr Muscles. But now that you've ripped off the mask and explicitly told me that I'm an addled hamster, deserving only of contempt, I guess I'll buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3374840/Piss_Off/">this game about pissing on people instead</a>.

<p>For balance, the developers had plenty of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-devs-tell-us-their-tips-for-real-life-house-cleaning">perfectly polite and genuinely helpful advice</a> to share with us about realworld cleaning in March. They all seem like lovely people. I cannot thank principal data analyst Russel Young enough for that tip about lemons and coffee mugs. I am less trustful of writer Mark Ginbey's comment about throwing ants on the floor.
</p>
<p>Satirical training video aside, the release date email includes a recap of the sequel's new features. Here you go.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Split-Screen &amp; Online Multiplayer - Clean solo, with a friend on the couch, or with up to four players online - all with shared progression.</li>
<li>Abseiling &amp; Scissor Lift - Scale buildings, hover over rooftops, and clean from every angle. Don't worry - fall damage doesn't exist here.</li>
<li>Multi-Stage Jobs - Just when you think you've finished, surprise: there's more to clean. Some jobs expand mid-wash, unlocking new areas on the fly.</li>
<li>Home Base Customisation - Restore furniture, decorate your HQ, and keep your base clean(ish). You earned it.</li>
<li>Career Mode - Take on 38 jobs across increasingly strange, sprawling, and oddly satisfying locations.</li>
<li>Soap, Nozzles &amp; Tools - Upgrade your washer loadout with adaptable nozzles, surface cleaners, and yes, foamy soap.</li>
<li>Cat Companions - Ulysses and her kittens are back, following you on jobs and expecting to be petted. Often.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"A rare simulator that's focused on fun, not faff," wrote Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) in our original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> review from 2022. "I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is," he urged, stressfully. "This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore." I expect the second game will follow firmly in those soapy bootprints.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-is-clearing-out-its-tv-soundbar-now-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-any-direct-competitor-2000632587</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-is-clearing-out-its-tv-soundbar-now-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-any-direct-competitor.1318819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Quality soundbars for your TV can easily run $1,000 or more, which makes better audio feel like a luxury purchase. The Bose TV speaker breaks that pattern by delivering clear and improved sound at a fraction of that cost. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">Normally priced at $279, this soundbar is now down to $199 for Prime Big Deal Day</a>, which marks an all-time low and only the second discount this year. Beyond improving your TV audio, <strong>it doubles as a Bluetooth speaker for your living room</strong> that you can control from your smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The underlying issue it addresses is easy: built-in TV speakers sound thin and muddy which causes dialogue to be difficult to follow and diminishes your enjoyment of shows and films. The Bose TV Speaker fixes it by <strong>employing two angled full-range drivers that produce a broader and more natural soundstage</strong>. Rather than having sound directly emanate at your face from one point, angled drivers reflect sound off your walls and bring it to life and opening it up, as it were.</p>
<h2>Dialogue Mode Makes Every Word Crystal Clear</h2>
<p>The dedicated dialogue enhancement feature is where we really see this soundbar excel for everyday listening. Bose designed the speaker to expressly zero in on vocal and pronunciation, and lifts dialogue out of the mix so that you can clearly hear each word without having to turn it up too high. There’s a remote included that has a button for a dialogue mode, which amplifies speech even more when desired. There’s also a bass boost mode for times when you want a deeper sound during music scenes or action scenes.</p>



<p>Setup only takes minutes due to a single-cable connection: <strong>Use your optical audio cable included, or connect via HDMI ARC if your TV is capable</strong> (HDMI cable not included). HDMI ARC provides a benefit of controlling soundbar volume by your TV’s remote for a seamless experience. Ultra-slim at just 2.21 inches high, 23.38 inches wide, and 4.02 inches deep, <strong>it fits seamlessly in front of nearly all TVs</strong>, neither covering nor obstructing IR sensor nor your view of the picture. It’s <strong>also wall mountable</strong> if a cleaner aesthetic is your preference, though brackets are separately available.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth connectivity offers convenience apart from TV sound: You <strong>are allowed to connect your smartphone, tablet, or laptop to stream music</strong>&nbsp;or even audiobooks directly through the soundbar’s sound output. The <strong>speaker stores a total of three devices</strong> via its multiple inputs: HDMI, optical and auxiliary. Whichever device is turned on first actually connects to it automatically, thereby never having to switch inputs manually each time.</p>
<p>At $199 for this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting sound engineering and construction of Bose for fewer dollars than are many budget soundbars which aren’t even CLOSE to providing clear and stereophonic sound like this one does.</p>

If for any reason there may be changes to your existing account, we will notify you at least 60 days in advance and you will have the option to cancel or change your subscription plan at any time.”</span></strong></p>



<p>After the emails went out, you’ve had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many take to Reddit</a> to confirm that they received the same message.</p>



<p>“Same with PC Gamepass in Germany, signed up for it when it was 9,99€, still paying 9,99€ after the increase to 11,99€ and got an email that the price will remain at 9,99€ instead of the new 14,99€ for me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Microsoft hasn’t made any sort of wide-ranging public comment on the matter. Insider Gaming has reached out to the company for clarification on prices for auto-renewal members and what regions are impacted. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>The store will appear on the ground floor of the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, and will be sticking around from <strong>22nd October - 16th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Those hoping to attend between the 22nd and the 26th will need to register for a free ticket via the <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">Nintendo Events website</a> (all those going from 27th onwards will not need to book in advance). The site is now live, with hour-long time slots available on all five opening days.</p>
<p>You'll need to be signed into a Nintendo Account to register for a free ticket, and if previous Pokémon Center pop-ups are anything to go by, we'd recommend getting in there fast.</p>

<p>The London pop-up will stock an extensive range of merch, including some exclusive pieces that are only available in the permanent stores in Japan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games is no longer launching on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">previously announced Halloween 2025 release date</a>. Instead, we no longer know when it is coming out on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Yacht Club Games announced the delay with <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a blog post on its website</a>, where it held that this would not be "<em>a major delay</em>," and that the team just needs "<em>a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.</p><p>Read the full announcement here➡️<a href="https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs">https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs</a> <a href="https://t.co/WXFqcbUl3x">pic.twitter.com/WXFqcbUl3x</a></p></div>— Yacht Club Games (@YachtClubGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/YachtClubGames/status/1975293906251296964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line</em>," Yacht Club continued. "<em>The game is so close to being done - we're playing it from start to finish every day.</em>"</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest for October 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, but in the most recent Steam Next Fest for the year this past June, Mina the Hollower was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">one of Wccftech's call-outs for what people should spend their time playing while the festival is on</a>.</p>



<p>When we checked out the demo, we wrote, "<em>The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Price Increase Reportedly Won’t Affect Every Existing Subscriber]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-won-t-affect-every-existing-user/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-reportedly-won%E2%80%99t-affect-every-existing-subscriber.1318786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Game Pass price hike announced on October 1, 2025, reportedly will not affect every existing subscriber when it goes into effect next month.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/">official Xbox Game Pass subreddit</a> earlier today, users shared recent emails informing them of the price increase, noting that some subscriptions will not be affected. Most exempt subscriptions exempt from the automatic increase are for users in European countries like Poland, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7d85l/">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7gokr/">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni83ymw/">Italy</a>, and Asian countries like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni8url6/">Indonesia</a>. This is likely due to local laws preventing an automatic price increase without the user's consent, although Microsoft has yet to provide confirmation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Xbox Game Pass subscription service has seen significant changes besides a price increase this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">rearranging subscription tiers into Essential, Premium, and Ultimate</a>. <span>While the Ultimate tier will offer considerable value with the addition of the Ubisoft + Classics library, the Fortnite Crew subscription, and day-one access to Xbox-published games, its steep price increase to $29.99/month wasn't well-received, so much so that the page to&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/" target="_blank">cancel the subscription was briefly overwhelmed.</a></span></p>



<p>Although the Xbox Game Pass service has seen multiple price increases, it will remain a central pillar of Xbox's market strategy. According to Xbox president Sarah Bond, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/">the service is a profitable business</a> that has reached a record high of $5 billion and is becoming more valuable for both users and creators.</p>

            <p>All is not well in the Warhammer world. All is seldom well in the Warhammer world, of course - get off my lawn, Chaos! - but in this case, all is specifically not well with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s non-player campaign factions. Creative Assembly are postponing more details of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-gets-the-best-bad-news-yet-about-future-updates">the delayed Tides of Torment pack</a> while they fix what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s lead technical designer modestly calls "a catastrophic failure in many of our AI systems". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These issues have apparently dogged Twarhammer 3 for weeks - they've been "highly visible" since <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/78-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-notes-6-3">update 6.3 in late August</a>, though the underlying problems pre-date that patch. Creative Assembly have yet to release a hotfix, however. "The issues with Campaign AI are unfortunately complex to resolve," the developer's head of community Adam Freeman <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1142710/view/519725729918748466?l=english">wrote on Steam yesterday</a>. "We haven't been able to deliver an immediate fix as we needed to conduct some very thorough investigations into the root causes, but we are working as quickly as the complexity allows."
</p>
<p>So what's the big deal with the busted campaign AI, then? Briefly, non-player factions aren't recruiting units properly due to mistaken "assumptions" about resources, which is causing rival empires to seize up like my knees on chilly October mornings. "We have found that the AI was building lists of units to recruit without taking caps into consideration, resulting in recruitment failing to occur and stalling the AI decision making process," Freeman writes. The issue has apparently been "compounded" by changes to the specialised resources Lizardmen and Tomb Kings need to recruit units.
</p>
<p>The post includes a deeper dive from lead technical designer Radoslav Borisov, explaining the effects of the AI failing to keep track of unit caps, while fleshing out some wider problems with the game's handling of "pooled resources".</p>
<p>"Should the AI decide that its next task should be to attack a settlement, it's generating a recruitment action and then expecting an increase in force strength to a level where it feels the settlement garrison that it's targeted for attack can be defeated," Borisov writes. 
</p>
<p>"Without the unit recruitment task's successful resolution, it holds up the subsequent task and leaves the AI in a paralyzed state. It's a cascade of failures that result in certain factions failing to complete any aggressive actions whatsoever."
</p>
<p>Borisov goes on to detail a few of the "assumptions" or "beliefs around the current state of the game world" that AI players rely upon to make decisions when recruiting units. "Any mistakes when constructing these assumptions has been found to lead to a catastrophic failure in many of our AI systems," he notes. 
</p><p>Right now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3's AI is having particular difficulty with the aforesaid <a href="https://tw-modding.com/wiki/Tutorial:Pooled_Resources_Updated">"pooled resources"</a> - broadly, a flexible type of in-game strategic resource that can be tethered to a "location" such as a region, faction or army. As Borisov goes on, "the AI's ability to understand, plan and budget pooled resources is not ideal. Lately, AI has not been factoring in pooled resource to its costs properly, leading to incorrect beliefs about what it can and cannot afford, resulting in action failure."
</p>
<p>According to Borisov, the past few weeks of investigation have shown Creative Assembly "that the majority of our internal systems were unprepared for actions that ostensibly could not fail, to fail." Difficulties with pooled resources have triggered an avalanche of other problems - "the AI couldn't change stances properly, attacking on the campaign failed, recruitment failed, laying siege failed, and so on".
</p>
<p>Creative Assembly have identified the "leading causes" of these issues, but Borislov says that "it's very likely there are other cases we are not yet aware of just yet". There are, he notes, "around 200 different pooled resources in the game and they are used in a large variety of ways". I have to confess, I'm not 100% clear on the link here between the pooled resource stuff and the unit cap issue, but the overall takeaway appears to be that now is a really great time to invade the Warhammer world, providing you're a human general capable of counting up spearmen without falling into a trance.
</p>
<p>Creative Assembly plan to begin addressing the problem with a hotfix next week. "It entered the first phases of our testing earlier today and is showing positive signs of providing an improved experience to the game," Freeman comments. The developers had originally planned to make fixes as part of the bulkier update 7.0, but they've decided that the issue needs to be addressed now. A glance at that canary in every Steam developer's coalmine, the user review box, reveals a Mostly Negative consensus over the past 30 days.</p>

              <p>Is there anything better than getting fully immersed in your favorite titles, feeling like you’re part of the game? A standard 16:9 screen is sadly not made for that, and if you don’t want to get pulled out right when things get good, going ultrawide is the solution.</p>
<p>We know upgrades like this can feel overwhelming, since a good-sized ultrawide screen from a known brand can easily run you over $1,600, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/">but that changes today. Thanks to Prime Day, the Samsung 49-inch Odyssey OLED G93SC curved gaming monitor is 44% off on Amazon, dropping the price to $900.</a> That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve ever seen on this wild screen, and with a $700 discount, it’s not a deal that’s likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen With Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a beast at 49 inches, offering brilliant colors, deeper contrast, and richer tones for lifelike visuals. More pixels per inch give you better detail, so you’re not sacrificing sharpness for size. The screen is as wide as two QHD monitors side by side, minus the dual setup fuss, with the 1800R curve wrapping around your field of vision for a distraction-free gaming or streaming experience. Dark colors come through clearly as well, thanks to QD-OLED technology and DisplayHDR True Black 400 support. Translation: better visibility even in low-light scenes; perfect for spotting the bad guys hiding in the dark and keeping an eye on shadows.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.03ms response time to keep things smooth. Plus, with both NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, screen tearing and input lag won’t be an issue either. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub. There’s also an Auto Source Switch+ that can detect when the connected devices are turned on and switch over automatically.</p>



<p>For when you’re in the mood for some multitasking, the Picture-by-Picture mode splits the screen in half. Maybe use one for video calls, while having work documents and the browser open on the second. Or maybe stream your favorite content on one side while editing on the other? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Even with all this, the overall design stays minimal. It’s just 4.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which makes it one of the slimmest OLED panels in this range.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/"> It’s still a bit of an investment at $900, but this deal brings it into a much more approachable range than we usually see.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage ranks among the most frustrating daily experiences. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem in a way no competitor can match, thanks to the <em>Find My</em> network powered by hundreds of millions of Apple devices worldwide. This massive network means your lost item can be located almost anywhere, even if it’s miles away from your own iPhone.</p>
<p>For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon has dropped AirTag prices to record lows. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">4-pack now costs just $64, down from $99</a>: Since a single AirTag normally sells for $29, <strong>this deal essentially gives you almost two free AirTags</strong>. If you only need one, the single AirTag is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">also at an all-time low of $19, down from $29</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags function by using Apple’s Find My network, <strong>a group of all iPhones, iPads, and Macs with their location services running</strong>. When you flag an AirTag lost, other <strong>Apple devices running Bluetooth proximity</strong> to it can pick up its Bluetooth signal and report its location anonymously back to yours. It all occurs entirely behind the scenes without notification of the other device’s owner, and all of your location information stays encrypted and private. By virtue of its massive scale, your AirTag becomes locatable even in isolated regions, if someone running an Apple device wanders by.</p>
<h2>Precision Location Detection and Privacy-Aware Design</h2>
<p>Installing an AirTag is a matter of seconds. You just point it near your iPhone or iPad, tap to pair and tag it to an item like your keys or backpack. The U1 chip in newer iPhones powers Precision Finding employs ultra-wideband technology and walks you straight to your AirTag with onscreen arrows and haptic indicators. As you approach, your iPhone displays the exact distance and direction and turns a potentially frantic search into a mere follow-the-arrows endeavor.</p>



<p>Each AirTag uses a <strong>typical CR2032 replaceable battery</strong>, which runs for approximately a year with average use. You’ll receive a notification when it’s running low, and it’s a breeze to replace it by pressing down and twisting off the stainless steel back case. The <strong>AirTag is water- and dust-resistant IP67</strong> so it’s fine being submerged for 30 minutes for a distance of a meter of water.</p>
<p>Privacy features are built into the core design: If an unknown AirTag is traveling with you, your iPhone alerts you automatically. Android users can also detect nearby AirTags using Apple’s Tracker Detect app. The AirTag will also play a sound if it’s been separated from its owner for an extended period, preventing unwanted tracking. These safeguards address privacy concerns while maintaining the device’s usefulness for legitimate tracking.</p>



<p>The thin, lightweight design is just 1.26 inches across and 0.31 inches deep, tiny enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or affix to a keychain. The shiny stainless steel face is customizable with free engraving if you order directly from Apple, but Amazon’s sale does not include it.</p>
<p>The 4-pack is nicely priced for families, couples, or individuals having several things they’d like to monitor. Put one on your keys, a second on your wallet, a third on your backpack, and maintain a fourth as a spare for your suitcase when traveling. For $64 for four during your Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re really spending less money per AirTag than ever before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has just released a mysterious animated short film with no explanation — leaving fans wondering whether it's a tease for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, or a hint at a new Pikmin game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At just under four minutes in length, the dialogue-free animation titled "Close to You" sees a blonde toddler taking their first steps, as their pacifier is mysteriously picked up by an invisible force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans will note several musical cues from the Pikmin series as the pacifier is picked up and seemingly carried away (though no Pikmin can actually be seen). At the same time, some Nintendo fans have said the child could be space princess Rosalina — who is surely set to debut in next year's Super Mario Galaxy Movie. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without any explanation at all from Nintendo itself, this is clearly something fans are being left to ponder about by themselves — though IGN has contacted Nintendo for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, the pacifier's movements really do look like they could be made by a band of Pikmin carrying the item aloft, and several Pikmin games have indeed tasked players with squirreling away household items. And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> even tasked players with venturing inside a human house for the first time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pikmin series has always been set on Earth, with Pikmin themselves suggested as always just being out of sight. Is this Nintendo making it clear that, to human eyes, Pikmin are indeed invisible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving aside the Pikmin music and other clues, other fans have suggested the child here could be Rosalina, whose parentage — alongside that of Princess Peach's own — looks set to finally be explained in next year's big-screen Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Is this a scene from that film? We're not sure — the animation style doesn't look quite the same as Illumination's own — but it's also odd to see Nintendo launching its own, unconnected animated short just six months out from its next big animated movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever this is, we'll update with more when we have it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

This makes it ideal for a starter PC or as a second screen, as the fast 1ms response time and refresh rate alongside AMD FreeSync means that you won't have to worry about input lag or screen tearing. Essentially, this display is worth considering if you want to keep an extra display hooked up for various tasks, or if you're looking to buy a PC that will become the household Fortnite machine for younger members of the family.</p><p>One other worth mentioning here is the physical setup of the monitor, as Acer's ZeroFrame design allows for an almost seamless view. At this price, it might be worth picking up two of these to get a multi-monitor setup that looks aesthetically pleasing.</p></div>                      </div>

                <p>While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is adding wall-jumping to players' repertoire of advanced movement options, developer Treyarch isn't taking a page from its 2015 futuristic title Black Ops 3 by incorporating wall-running or Thrust Jumps for one simple reason: It's too early for that.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie reiterated that Black Ops 7, which takes place in the year 2035, is more of a direct follow-up to 2012's Black Ops 2, which took place in the then-far-fetched future of 2025.</p>

Meanwhile, Black Ops 3 takes place further into the future in the year 2065, giving Treyarch some canonical limitations on where to take its Omnimovement systems. In other words, wall-running just isn't possible in the time Black Ops 7 takes place in.</p><p>"We are really precious to our own canon; we have to respect that. So that meant we couldn't have Thrust Jump, because the tech didn't exist in 2035," Leslie said. "Wall-running made sense when we were further in the future but, with our return to the Black Ops 2 era, that world just didn't have that sort of technology so it made sense not to do it."</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-wall-jumping-works-in-black-ops-7/1100-6534910/" data-ref-id="1100-6534910">wall-jump in Black Ops 7</a> on certain surfaces to get some additional vertical height. Each subsequent wall jump will reduce momentum, but you can chain three wall jumps together before hitting the ground.</p><p>The ability to wall-run first appeared in the Call of Duty franchise in Black Ops 3 and returned in Infinity Ward's space-faring 2016 game Infinite Warfare. Famously, removing wall-running and Thrust Jumps was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-revamps-multiplayer-for-a/1100-6459058/" data-ref-id="1100-6459058">Treyarch's selling points for Black Ops 4</a>, which released in 2018 and was set in the year 2045, before Black Ops 3.

		<p>FuturLab has announced that it will be releasing PowerWash Simulator 2 on October 23rd, making the announcement with a new trailer. The follow up to PowerWash Simulator is going to be available on &nbsp;Steam, Epic Games, Windows Store, Xbox Series X|S, PS5 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2 with a price of $24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99 / JP¥2970.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2 | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrFexXPbVuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 expands massively on the original game, with powerwashing just being one of the activities in the game. The town of Muckingham &nbsp;will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham. There will be additional locations to explore too including &nbsp;Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. You will have access to new tools including an abseiling rig and cherry picker to reach those hard to reach spots.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/06/powerwash-simulator-2-preview-twice-the-cleaning-power/">PowerWash Simulator 2 Preview – Twice the cleaning power?</a></h2>
<p>In our PowerWash Simulator 2 preview, Stefan said, <em>“There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>developer FuturLab has revealed the upcoming cleaning sim's release date, and it's much closer than you might think, so it won't be long before you can load up your power washer once again.</p>

<p>As announced via a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 23rd. As far as we know, the game is due to launch on day one for Game Pass as well, although given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, that might not be quite such an enticing prospect anymore.</p>

<p>Announced back in March this year,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2022's relaxing cleaning sim&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Like its predecessor, this followup will let you loose on a variety of filthy environments, and it's up to you to make them clean once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-grime.jpg?itok=tqaHQAwT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-grime.jpg?itok=4urDB8zd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's so much grime and dirt in here it's practically painful.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a sequel if there weren't improvements and new features galore, and so you can expect to explore not only Muckingham but the environs beyond its borders this time around.</p>

<p>Those locations will be part of a brand new campaign that will take you to such aptly-named locations as Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. I wouldn't think too hard about that last one if I were you.</p>

<p>New multi-stage jobs will test your cleaning prowess over several different stages, and naturally, you can expect a range of new tools to help you tackle those jobs, including a new abseiling rig, a cherry picker, and a surface cleaner for bigger areas.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which shows off some of the game's satisfying-looking cleaning action (as well as its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">frankly criminally adorable cat</a>), right here.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23rd.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-25000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory-2000632554</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-25-000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory.1318726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small power banks that charge your phone are handy, but did you know power banks exist for laptops too? They’re less common but incredibly practical, especially since they can charge your phone and other devices at the same time. Running out of battery during a flight or during a long day away from outlets becomes a non-issue when you have serious charging capacity in your bag. For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">has dropped the price on the most popular Anker (25,000mAh, 100W) laptop power bank to $89, down from $134</a>. That’s a $45 discount and an all-time low for this Anker model, <strong>available exclusively to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker power bank <strong>boasts an enormous capacity of 25,000mAh</strong> which equates to usable real-world powering of your devices. For context, it’s enough to give a full charge to a MacBook Air, enough to supply your iPhone several full charges or keep your tablet going for hours of continuous use. With a 90Wh rating, it also falls within airline requirements for personal protective devices for your carry-ons, so it’s permissible to bring it onboard your flights.</p>
<h2>Triple 100W USB-C Ports Upgrade Your Charging Experience</h2>
<p>The <strong>crown jewel here is the three USB-C ports</strong>, each of which is capable of dispensing a <strong>whopping 100W of power</strong>. That’s important because newer laptops require serious power to charge at a full speed. A MacBook Pro 16-inch, say, requires about 96W for best-in-class charging. With 100W per port, you’ll be able to charge your laptop at full speed, <strong>all while powering other devices simultaneously.</strong></p>



<p>The built-in cables rectify one of the greatest nuisances of power banks: forgetting or misplacing charging cables. <strong>Anker ships two USB-C cables embedded on the power bank itself</strong>. One of them reaches a distance of up to 2.3 feet and gives you a degree of mobility when outlets are centralized or when you want to access your device as it charges. This retractable cable is rated for more than 20,000 times of retraction so it should not readily fail due to wear and tear. The other cable is 0.98 feet long and also serves as a strap for carrying, designed to withstand over 20,000 bends. Such a dual purpose creates durability and portability.</p>
<p>Along with the built-in cabling, there are also other sources of charging <strong>available in the form of a USB-A port and a second USB-C port</strong>, for a<strong> total of four devices being charged simultaneously</strong>. This setup is best for traveling families or professionals who carry multiple devices along. You may charge your laptop off one built-in cabling, your cell phone off the other, your wireless headsets off the USB-A port and a smartwatch off the additional USB-C port.</p>



<p>Recharging of the power bank itself is incredibly quick due to a 100W ultra-fast recharging feature. It achieves a capacity of being at a 30% state by being plugged into a charger of 100W within a total of 22 minutes. <strong>Recharging takes a total of about 90 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so keep it topped off during your morning getting-ready process or lunchtime.</p>
<p>As a Prime member for $89 during this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting laptop-level powering capability at a budget-friendly cost.</p>

              <p>Will the jump button come back in the next <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? Will<em> Battlefield 6</em> really work right out of the box? Can <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> prevent the further atomization of modern society? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still thinking about Xbox and how much Microsoft keeps fumbling the bag. And I’m <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975227593763999973">apparently not</a> <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975244040896716915">the only</a> <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1975556977536475617">one</a>. But for real: what’s going on <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1974904157829321171">with those Walmart displays</a>?</p> <h2>The Saudi Arabia <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> DLC will let you manually jump</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Reportedly funded by</a> Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC is a free major update for the 2023 game that takes Basim to the AlUla region in search of his long-lost father. It includes a new skill, tool customization, difficulty levels, and replaybale missions and challenges. The most important change to me, however, is the addition of a manual jump to add more depth to the parkour. The stealth action series hasn’t had a dedicated jump button since <em>Unity</em> as movement became more streamlined and automated. Hopefully, the experiment pays dividends in <em>Valley of Memory</em> and paves the way for more complex parkour in the next big <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is reportedly coming to PS Plus this month</h2> <p>That’s according <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">to billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, who says last year’s PS5 exclusive will be arriving as part of the Extra and Premium tiers later this month. It arrives alongside <em>Alan Wake 2</em> on PS Plus Essential and <em>The </em><em>Last of Us Part 2</em> on Extra and Premium. Not a bad haul for this year’s Halloween.</p>

 <h2>Physical copies of <em>Battlefield 6</em> are out early and include at least part of the game on the actual disc</h2>   <p>Bucking recent trends, <em>Battlefield 6</em> apparently comes with the actual game on the disc, at least on PS5. A fan on Reddit claims the servers are live and the campaign and multiplayer both work. You can preview the game’s full day-one update and all of the over 200 changes it makes <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1975214752314937744">here</a>.</p>

 <h2>Funcom layoffs hit <em>Metal Hellsinger</em> studio</h2> <p>The Outsiders, a Funcom studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, is shutting down, founder and creative director David Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">announced yesterday</a>. The team had previously produced the rhythm-based demonic FPS <em>Hellsinger</em> which sold one million copies. ” It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen,” he wrote. The veteran developer said the plan is to “continue on in some new form.”</p> <h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is out October 23</h2>  <p>The sequel to the hit <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-sim-2-trailer-release-campaign-splitscreen-1851769691">OCD management game</a> arrives with some upgraded visuals, split-screen co-op, and an increased focus on story beats which the original game kept mostly in the background.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marathon</i>, Bungie’s upcoming hero extraction shooter, is getting another invite-only test soon. The test will run from October 22 to 27, and <a href="http://www.bungie.net/7/cen/News/Article/techtestapply">folks can sign up right here</a>. Things haven’t gone great for <i>Marathon</i> thus far, but following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">disappointing reception</a> of the first alpha test, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">embarrassing accusations of plagiarism</a>, it’ll be interesting to see what tweaks Bungie has made and just what the game is shaping up to be.</p> <p>Revealed back in 2023 with a very impressive cinematic trailer, <i>Marathon</i> is a reboot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-marathon-halo-destiny-extraction-shooter-1850480259">Bungie’s classic <i>Doom</i>-like shooter</a> from the ‘90s. It’s also Bungie’s first new shooter since it made the pivot to <i>Destiny</i> in the early 2010s, following its departure from Microsoft and the <i>Halo</i> series.</p>

 <h2>There’s still no release date for <i>Marathon</i>, and the game has a lot to prove to fans</h2> <p><i>Marathon</i> was originally slated to release for current-gen consoles and PC on September 23, 2025. That date has come and gone. Unfortunately for Bungie, folks didn’t find the game terribly fun during the alpha earlier this year, and so the studio made the decision to indefinitely delay its release. The drab environments didn’t really speak to Bungie’s artistic strengths, and the hero shooter element (which I, a huge extraction shooter fan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">tried to be open-minded</a> about) still seems like an odd fit.</p>

Matches mostly consisted of fights with the same repetitive robots instead of incorporating the more alluring palette of creature designs the <i>Marathon</i> franchise has.</p>

 <p>We do know that the upcoming closed test will let players try out a new feature: Proximity chat, which allows you to hear other players’ voice chatter only when you’re near them. Bungie initially wanted to avoid using this, as the studio felt it was ripe for toxicity and abuse. While proximity chat can result in, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/warzone-2-features-proximity-chat-gulag-contracts-mw2-1849793098">rather silly situations in a shooter</a>, it’s a pretty important feature in a PvPvE game; overhearing nearby players not only adds a bit of voyeuristic drama, but it can also help you avoid getting jumped sometimes.</p>

 <p>The closed test will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-marathon-details-leak-from-latest-closed-test/">feature some tweaks to TTK (time-to-kill) as well</a>. We’ll see if this is enough to start rehabilitating <i>Marathon</i>’s image for folks.</p> <h2>It’s been a real cluster-f over at Bungie from the sounds of things</h2> <p>Conversations about the nuances of what does and doesn’t work in <i>Marathon</i> were all pushed to the side when it was revealed that Bungie had lifted designs from artist antire.al without permission or acknowledgement.</p>

 <p>Bungie had its explanations for how the artist’s work made it into its game, essentially saying that it was material used for inspiration and research that found its way into production pipelines, and thus made it into the game. The studio blamed this oversight on a former employee and promised a full review of all its assets to be sure this wouldn’t happen again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Players have reported that Battlefield 6 physical copies include the entire game and do not require any additional downloads to play. </p>



<p>It’s less than 3 days until the highly anticipated Battlefield 6 releases on October 10, 2025. Interestingly, some players who had pre-ordered the physical copy of BF6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-physical-copies-reportedly-received-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received the game early</a> and have started providing reports on what is available on the disc, and it seems you can have the whole experience right off the bat. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-servers-seem-like-they-are-already-online">Battlefield 6 Servers Seem Like They Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-physical-copies-are-content-complete-and-require-no-initial-install-according-to-early-copy-holders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the original poster, who had received Battlefield 6’s physical copy early, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2p42z/?share_id=gftOQn-SiPIYz2EDMKSD6&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> some other details as well. A player asked the OP whether the game was playable without an internet connection and required no additional downloads, and the answer was “yes”. The OP also confirmed other points, such as being able to play the campaign through the Battlefield 6 disc, and the multiplayer servers seem to be online as well. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have also contributed to the hype ahead of the game’s release recently. During a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a>, the developers stated that “requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more.” These points are likely to make fans happy, as even more exciting content appears to be on the way. </p>



<p>In other news, early patch notes for Battlefield 6’s day one update have been shared by EA ahead of release, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-day-one-early-patch-notes-shared-by-ea-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 200 changes coming.</a> Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact release times</a> for BF6. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 physical copies not requiring additional downloads?
