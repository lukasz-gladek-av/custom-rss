		<p>Wargaming has revealed Steel Hunters, their next big online multiplayer game, but instead of WW2 and Cold War tanks, boats and planes, this has got great bit forking mechs!</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game with undercurrents of hero shooters, battle royale and extraction shooter… but you’re in great big mechs that are definitely very reminiscent of Transformers and (for the cultured among us) Zoids.</p>
<p>With a full release expected next year, Wargaming are kicking off a reveal day playtest, which is available tonight from 12th until 22nd December. Join now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://steelhunters.com/">Steel Hunters website</a>.</p>

		<p>The Game Awards played host to the next game from genDesign, the studio of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ico">ICO</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-guardian">The Last Guardian</a> creator Fumito Ueda.</p>

<p>A game that is as yet unnamed, it seems to feature a lot of the tone and feel of Ueda’s work, though viewed through a sci-fi lens of sorts.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an ominous message to evacuate the region surrounding ground zero, and then a countdown before a cataclysmic event, there’s a rushed climb up a huge body, which leads to a giant mech head that, thankfully, manages to blast off and detach from its body before a brutal storm blows in.</p>
<p>That’s all we’ve got to go on right now, but it’s great to see that the minds behind some landmark games from the PS2 and PS3 are back to work on something equally distinctive.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is launching on PC next month, less than a year since its launch on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>During today's&nbsp;<span>Game Awards Show, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwRgIlqqK_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short trailer confirmed</a> that the PC version of the second entry in the Remake trilogy will launch on January 23rd via Steam and the Epic Games Store. The new version of the game will feature improved lighting, enhanced textures and modeling over the PlayStation 5 version, NVIDIA DLSS and VRR support,</span>&nbsp;and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH | PC ANNOUNCE TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwRgIlqqK_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5, and will launch on PC on January 23rd. You can learn more about one of the best games Square Enix has released in years by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warren-spectors-thick-as-thieves-is-a-pvpve-stealth-action-game-out-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warren-spector%E2%80%99s-thick-as-thieves-is-a-pvpve-stealth-action-game-out-in-2026.1059975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warren-spectors-thick-as-thieves-is-a-pvpve-stealth-action-game-out-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>OtherSide Entertainment, the studio founded by Warren Spector and Paul Neurath, has unveiled its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warren-spector-is-working-on-an-immersive-sim-based-on-a-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new immersive sim-inspired IP</a> at The Game Awards 2024. It's called Thick As Thieves, and it will be a PvPvE stealth action multiplayer game, which will definitely wrinkle the noses of some classic immersive sim fans since they are used to single player adventures.</p>
<p>However, Warren Spector maintains that the new game sits firmly in the studio's historic immersive sim roots. In a prepared statement, he said:</p>
<p><em>Thick As Thieves captures the vision of immersive gameplay that OtherSide was founded on. With this game, we’re empowering players to create their own stories in a world that values observation, craftiness, and creative problem-solving.</em></p>
<p>Thick As Thieves will be published by Megabit, Aonic's new publishing arm. Benjie Clarke, Managing Director of Global Publishing at Megabit, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>OtherSide Entertainment’s co-founders helped pioneer the stealth action genre with the original Thief and Deus Ex games. Their collaboration at OtherSide has rekindled this vision, now focused on pushing boundaries with fresh perspectives. Thick As Thieves marks the next step for what an immersive action game can accomplish and how sharing this experience with other players leads to incredible player-driven storytelling.</em></p>

<p>Thick As Thieves is set in an alternate history 1910 metropolis where technology meets magic and glittering wealth clashes with a thriving criminal underclass. As the upper class amasses wealth and power while the lower class struggles to survive, players must weave their way through both worlds, using stealth and cunning in their quest for treasure and glory.</p>
<p>Players engage in a unique competitive multiplayer experience where infiltration, theft, and escape are the keys to success. According to the developer, the game rewards cunning tactics, planning, and improvisation. However, every shadow and corner can potentially hide a new challenge - from wary guards to devious rivals to the ever-changing, treacherous city itself, which OtherSide describes as a world full of characters, stories and mysteries. There will also be a personal storyline where the main character shapes their own destiny and journey from nobody to crime legend.</p>
<p>Rising through the ranks will literally open doors, as players get the option to pick locks, hijack alarms, bamboozle guards, silence civilians, and conceal their presence in their never-ending quest to escape with a bag full of loot.</p>
<p>As part of the immersive sim theme, keeping an eye on the city's inhabitants and their daily habits might just help players: maybe the housemaid has talked to her husband, who has talked to the barmaid after a few drinks.</p>
<p>Thick As Thieves will launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/underworld-ascendant-underwhelming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwhelming launch of Underworld Ascendant</a> and the cancelation of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/system-shock-3-tencent-takes-over-nightdive-owns-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">System Shock 3</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">untitled Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a>, it will no doubt be very important for OtherSide's future.</p>

At the Game Awards, Gearbox Software revealed the first proper trailer for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, which is due out in 2025. The trailer starts with a cinematic depicting a large-scale conflict of some sort, before getting into the actual gameplay — which is as colorful and violent as you’d expect from the franchise. The game is playable solo or co-op with up to three other players, and Gearbox says that there are “billions” of weapons to use.</p><p>Here’s the basic set-up:</p><div><blockquote><p>Break free from the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high. Now a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect Order, unleashing mayhem across the planet. Ignite a resistance and blast your way through mechanical monstrosities, bloodthirsty bandits, and vicious beasts.

            <p>It's the Game Awards this evening, which means another year of Josef Fares appearing on stage to performatively say "fuck" like he thinks it's naughty. Thankfully this year he also had a game to show: Split Fiction, a new co-op action adventure. It's about two aspiring authors, one who writes science fiction and one who writes fantasy, being sucked into and having to survive inside their own fictions.

<p>Split Fiction takes place in a near-future where a tech company is able to turn people's stories into virtual worlds. Insert your commentary about generative AI here. In this instance, protagonists Mio and Zoe are shoved into their own stories, but they're strangers, and they have to survive in those dangerous, collapsing worlds as they get to know one another. 
</p>
<p>Levels seemingly alternate back and forth between sci-fi, with robots and explosions and cybercops, and a trad fantasy world of dragons. Both worlds seem... a bit cliché? But perhaps that's intentional given that these worlds are, in the fiction, created by newbie writers. Perhaps they will grow and learn and become better at worldbuilding by the end of the game.
</p><p>Yes, I'm giving it too much credit. Split Fiction is from Hazelight, the developers of other co-op games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>. I played It Takes Two and it's pretty good, because it constantly shifts setting and mechanics in a way that keeps it fresh and surprising. It's not particularly narratively coherent, however, and there's often very little connection between the plot or emotional beats and the mecha-insect you're piloting while murdering wasps for some reason.
</p>
<p>In any case, I'm looking forward to Split Fiction. It's already got a release date, too: March 6th, 2025.

            <p>The Geoffies have delivered us a first look at the gameplay for Obsidian’s spacefaring RPG sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. It looks, as you might expect, very much like the first one, but a bit nicer. The game itself was announced back in 2021, but we’ve seen nary a vaguely satirical sign nor very large gun since.

<p>The Outer Worlds 2, which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">Steam here</a>, is due out sometime next year. You’ll be exploring a new frontier named The Arcadia colony. It’s “engulfed in a factional war” which is probably bad news for the residents, but undoubtedly good news for people who like to pick a side to do quests for.</p>
<p>Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart spoke about the game’s progress <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/outer-worlds-2-is-looking-incredible-says-obsidian-boss-but-they-did-consider-throwing-the-whole-team-on-avowed">back in August</a>, which they’ve been developing simultaneously with fantasy RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. "It's going really well," Urquhart said. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> turned out awesome. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a> turned out awesome. Avowed is going to be great. Outer Worlds 2 is looking incredible. And then we have a base now, of everything we've now done with Avowed and Outer Worlds 2, with how we use Unreal Engine and all the tools that we've been developing for years and years, to go off and make the whole next generation of games."</p>
<p>Here’s Alice Bell’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-pc-review">review of the first game</a>. “<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> is alright, innit. It's good fun. Sit back and let the orange and neon wash over you. Boo the cartoonishly evil corporations,” she wrote. “But you can tell it could have been great, if it had taken a few more risks. Real space cowboys take risks, don't they?”</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> launched on console back in February, and if I'd had to guess, I'd say it would arrive on PC about a year later. Hey - guess what! Square Enix just gave Rebirth a PC release date: January 23rd, 2025.
</p>

<p>The PC release will have improved lighting, enhanced textures and models, and support for DLSS and other graphics features. You can see it in action in the brief trailer below:

<p>Rebirth continues where Remake left off, by rendering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>'s post-Midgar areas in all the high-res glory modern machines can muster. We haven't done a proper review of it obviously, because it hasn't been out on PC, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ff7-rebirths-open-world-is-both-one-step-forward-and-one-step-back-over-ff15">Katharine did enjoy it when she played it on console</a> (supporters only), even as she had some issues with its open world design:
</p>
<blockquote>That's not to say Rebirth isn't as spectacular or jaw-droppingly pretty and awe-inspiring as other open worlds. But the way it adheres to the Chadley tick-box regime does, I think, rob it of some of its potential wonder. Once you've done all those tasks, there's very little else to discover in them, leaving them feeling a little empty and lacking in mystery. For all Final Fantasy 15's faults, of which there are many, I did always feel a sense of curious excitement whenever I turned another bend on one of its many great highways, and the idle chatter of my lads in the back of the car gave the world a little more flavour and a little more personality as a result. Your Rebirth crew might be better chocobo riders than Noctis and his boyband, but they sure are a weirdly silent bunch as you bounce between mission objectives.</blockquote>
<p>We'll have a full review in the new year, around its release on January 23rd.

<p>Revealed at the Game Awards just now, The Witcher 4 video is both a showcase for the engine technology, “pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU”, and a demonstration of the kind of quest you might encounter in the game, which looks to follow squarely in The Witcher 3’s bootprints.</p>
<p>We see Ciri take on a contract to save a girl from being sacrificed to a spidery forest creature. “Aiming to slay the beast and save the girl at the same time, Ciri finds herself at odds with the prejudices and superstitions of the people she tries to protect, leading her to confront a painful witcher lesson: that monsters come in all forms,” comments <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards">a press release on the official site</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows off a few of Ciri’s tools, including Witcher spells and a chain-hook weapon you’ll seemingly use to stop monsters darting about, readying them for your silver sword.</p>
<p>Ciri won’t just be the star of this game: she’ll helm the next few Witcher games, according to game director Sebastian Kalemba.</p>
<p>“We're kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” he said in the press release. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of The Witcher IV; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.” </p>
<p>For clarity, The Witcher 4 is the project previously codenamed Polaris. CD Projekt have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-are-making-a-new-witcher-trilogy-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-and-a-brand-new-ip">plenty other irons in the fire</a>. What do you make of it all?</p>

And at the end of that, there’s a moment where the player uses a holo-grapple hook-thingy and zips up to a higher area in a few seconds. Older <em>Borderlands </em>games didn’t have this much mobility, but <em>Borderlands 3</em> did add mantling and more movement options. It seems the fourth entry in Gearbox’s sci-fi franchise will add even more ways to move around while killing bandits and looting weapons. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-teaser-trailer-2025-release-date-1851627084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-teaser-trailer-2025-release-date-1851627084"><em>Borderlands 4 </em>was previously announced in August</a></span>.

The challenges will scale through a day-night cycle with players facing a Nightlord boss on the third night. It’ll be on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. FromSoftware says players will never experience the same playthrough twice.</p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Multiple players will be able to band together against tough enemies and brutal bosses in what seems almost like a live-service roguelite. They’ll explore dangerous parts of the map for better weapons and greater Rune rewards and uncover Sites of Grace to level up heroes. Each run will get players closer to unravelling the story and bestow lasting stat bonuses.&nbsp;</p><p>There also seems to be more flexibility and versatility in how characters move, suggesting combat might be a little more twitchy and arcade-y than that in the original <em>Elden Ring</em>. The smaller scale of the world might also allow <em>Nightreign</em> to explore some design elements more deeply than the first game. </p><p>FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki previously said that the studio had no plans to work on an <em>Elden Ring</em> sequel but that multiple other projects exploring other genres were in production. <em>Nightreign</em> certainly fits that description, and probably means that even though we’re getting more <em>Elden Ring</em>, we won’t be getting a direct sequel after all anytime soon. </p><p>The studio’s majority owner, Kadokawa Corporation, is currently looking at a potential merger with Sony. While the acquisition seems targeted at the parent company’s vast media holdings, which include anime, manga, and online streaming distribution, the maker of<em> Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>joining the larger PlayStation portfolio is no doubt part of the appeal.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amir Satvat has received a brand-new award at The Game Awards – the ‘Game Changer’ award.</p>



<p>In a segment covering Amir Satvat’s work in supporting those impacted by layoffs across the wider gaming industry, the world learned about one man’s mission to offer salvation to thousands upon thousands of industry professionals.</p>



<p>Satvat took to the stage in Los Angeles to give an emotional acceptance speech and received a standing ovation from the substantial crowd in attendance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-drawing-attention">Drawing Attention</h2>



<p>Amir Satvat is a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. He has worked tirelessly over the years to carve out a profile that’s personified by his reluctance to do anything but the best for the people around him.</p>



<p>In the past, people have criticised The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley for refusing to draw attention to or even acknowledge the vast waves of layoffs that hit our industry over the last two years. This time around, on the show’s tenth anniversary, Geoff and his team rolled out a sizeable segment addressing just that.</p>

<p>The first official look at Borderlands 4 is here as Gearbox released its new trailer for the game during The Game Awards 2024. The new trailer not only gives a look at the game’s cinematics, but fans also got to see Borderlands 4 gameplay for the first time.</p>



<p>You can watch the full trailer below.</p>

<iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhKilJFhI3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As seen in the trailer, Borderlands 4 takes place in a completely new location and features brand-new characters. There are also returning characters such as Claptrap, 9 Toes, and more.</p>



<p>“Borderlands 4 is a mayhem-fueled looter shooter, jam-packed with billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action,” the game’s description reads. “Break free from a dangerous hidden planet as one of four new badass Vault Hunters.”</p>



<p>Days before the gameplay reveal, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-borderlands-4-trailer-coming-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on social media</a> that he was excited about showing players the progress of the game. Borderlands 4 was first revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, and is currently scheduled for a 2025. As far as when in 2025 it releases, that seems to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depend on when Rockstar</a> — another Take-Two Interactive studio — decides to launch Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

<p>The Witcher 4 takes a franchise already steeped in blood and rich history and propels the saga to its next juicy chapter. CD Projekt Red is set to deliver an all-new story with everyone’s favorite characters, so here’s the latest on The Witcher 4, the latest release window details, and much more.</p>



<p>If you haven’t invested hundreds of hours into The Witcher 3, I’m unsure if we can be friends. It’s harsh, but fair, and should encourage you to go and get started. The Witcher 3 is an all-time great video game from start to finish: Its quests, story, characters, rich world, intricate combat, and effervescent world. This is why The Witcher 4 needs to hurry up and get into my possession.</p>



<p>As much as I loved Cyberpunk 2077, I think we’re all ready for The Witcher 4 to see what the Continent conjures next.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-witcher-4-release-window">Do we Know The Witcher 4 Release Window?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Meaner than ever. Credit to CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, we do not know when The Witcher 4 is set to release—nor do we have an approximate timeframe.</strong></p>



<p>We knew The Witcher 4 was likely to appear at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024, and it happened</a>. The footage finally showed off the RPG sequel and gave a glimpse into its future. For now, we’ll have to wait for updates from CD Projekt Red, so keep checking back for the latest updates.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-witcher-4-platforms">Do we Know The Witcher 4 Platforms?</h2>



<p>Once again, we don’t have The Witcher 4’s platforms yet. But, given the presumed size and scope of the sequel, we fully expect it to receive simultaneous launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>A last-gen release is likely too ambitious for the outdated PS4 and Xbox One, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-leaks-satisfye-accessory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> might struggle. It all remains to be seen.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-the-witcher-4-characters">All The Witcher 4 Characters</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Ciri </strong>is the only recognizable character in The Witcher 4 we’ve noticed from the iconic franchise.</p>



<p>The Witcher 3 ends quite declaratively hinting Geralt of Rivia’s time as the main protagonist is up—for now at least. Geralt is reportedly set to feature in The Witcher 4, but Ciri is our main character.</p>



<p>Here’s the first trailer courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thewitcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Witcher</a> YouTube channel.</p>

<p>The Witcher 4 details are very scarce right now. Understandably, CD Projekt Red is keeping its card close to its chest, and development is likely going to take a while. Please do keep checking back as we are going to keep this hub up to date with the latest details, leaks, and anything in between.</p>

<p>Let us know how excited you are for The Witcher 4. We hope to bring you as much information as we can, and no doubt the RPG is going to be another Game of the Year contender.</p>

She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Sebastian Kalemba added that because Ciri is younger than Geralt, players will have more freedom to define her character in a way they couldn’t with Geralt. This also affords the developers more space to explore her character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“She's actually about to become the Witcher,” Kalemba explained. “She's about to actually form her own codex, but on her own terms. The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it's her own unique way. And also I think that she gives more room to be able to tell different stories here and there. Of course, we want to give the opportunity for the player to explore more nuance because this is what we do. But she deserves that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Mitręga and Kalemba acknowledged a potential backlash from some corners of the internet at Ciri’s role as protagonist in The Witcher 4, but both insisted Ciri was always going to be the game’s main character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There was an intention behind this choice,” Kalemba said. “It was far from roulette. It wasn't random. I remember we had discussions nine years ago, we were talking about who's next? The very, very instant answer was Ciri. There are many reasons behind that. We've already mentioned a few. But she really deserves a stage and we want players to really experience her story because she has so much to tell, so much to prove. The amount of challenges that are in front of her give us so much amazing energy and fuel to create an epic saga that we had no choice but to go with it. We all felt that this is the way. I believe this is the super right choice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more exclusive content on The Witcher 4, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-12-vital-trailer-details-revealed-by-cd-projekt-red">a trailer breakdown</a> and an interview with CD Projekt where the developer explains <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-plans-to-avoid-a-cyberpunk-2077-launch-disaster-with-the-witcher-4">why The Witcher 4 will avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-style launch disaster</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-reds-plans-for-its-next-big-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since I can remember, we've been talking about Ciri and how much she deserves her own journey,” says Sebastian Kalemba, game director of The Witcher 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This likely won’t come as a surprise to many fans of CD Projekt Red’s beloved RPG series. Ever since the Polish developer announced “Polaris”, The Witcher 4’s codename, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir">people have theorised</a> that the series would switch perspective from the iconic Geralt of Rivia to his adoptive daughter, Ciri. She is, after all, effectively the secondary protagonist of both the original novels and The Witcher 3. “I think ‘The Witcher’ as a title refers to both Geralt and Ciri and always has,” explains Cian Maher, franchise and lore designer at CDPR. “I think she's arguably more important to the plot than Geralt himself is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last we saw Ciri she was a young woman facing her destiny. But now, as depicted in a new cinematic trailer shown at The Game Awards 2024, Ciri is a fully-fledged witcher hunting monsters for profit. Kalemba explains that, following the events of The Witcher 3, Ciri has undertaken the famously painful Trial of the Grasses which has mutated her into a powerful and resilient warrior. She’s ready to take on a whole new journey in The Witcher 4, which is the first part of a planned new trilogy of single-player, open-world RPGs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love this grit in her,” Kalemba says. “She's almost obsessed with the way she lives. There are some moments where you have to go with your heart instead of always going with the calculated calls. And this is what I love in Ciri. She's less calculating, following her heart, her passion, her gut feel.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher IV Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this passion that will differentiate Ciri from Geralt, and subsequently The Witcher 4 from its predecessors. “We want to let players try to define her,” says Kalemba. Unlike Geralt, who has been a veteran monster hunter for the entire Witcher saga, Ciri is only just starting her career. That means there’s space for players to create their own version of her. “She's about to form her own codex on her own terms,” Kalemba reveals. “The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it's her own unique way.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As any veteran of CD Projekt Red’s RPGs will know, the shape of Ciri and her codex will be dictated by decisions, both big and small. We see an example of such during the trailer, in which Ciri’s interruption of a dark ritual results in the death of a girl she is attempting to save. It’s a classic example of the studio’s signature approach to choice and unforeseen consequences, but Kalemba promises a deeper approach for this fourth chapter. “We want to put player agency at the center,” he says. Achieving such has required an expansion and evolution of The Witcher’s definition of player choice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[We’re giving] more tools for players' disposal, to be able to not only play and go with the consequences narratively, but also gameplay-wise,” explains Kalemba. “We want to give players more opportunities to be able to feel that they define their experience.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We want to give players more opportunities to be able to feel that they define their experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Witcher 3 is quite rightly considered among the very best RPGs of the 21st century, its admirable complexity is very much in its narrative design rather than elastic gameplay. For example, Geralt can’t become a master of stealth and silently backstab his way to victory, nor can he hone his skills in niche polearms to develop a particular fighting style. But in the years between Witcher projects CDPR created Cyberpunk 2077, an RPG with much, much greater flexibility when it comes to those kinds of choices. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I believe the gameplay [in Cyberpunk 2077] was more varied [than that in The Witcher 3] and it allowed more freedom when it comes to creating character builds and being able to experience encounters in your own way,” Kalemba explains. Every encounter in 2077’s Night City is a flowchart of decisions: Action or stealth? Hacking or weapons? Ranged or melee? Those options are expanded and enhanced by the skills and perks you’ve invested in (as well as a healthy dose of curiosity and experimentation). And so for Ciri’s next adventure, the studio is looking to not just build upon what it achieved in The Witcher 3, but also Cyberpunk 2077 and its expansion, Phantom Liberty.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is something we definitely want to bring as a lesson [to The Witcher 4],” asserts Kalemba. “We want to improve on [The Witcher 3’s] gameplay but also we want to improve the alignment of the way you will be able to explore the world.” He hopes that such improvements will result in a “super coherent experience” across main story missions, side quests, and open-world activities. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/main-feature-00-08-31-10-still010-1734010444308.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ciri faced her destiny at the end of The Witcher 3, but that was not the end of her story. Image credit: The Witcher 3 / CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Red definitely has the ‘bigger, better, more advanced’ aspect of a AAA sequel underway, then. But sequels are also about continuing the story, and while The Witcher 4 is the start of a new saga, it’s still the next chapter in an established character’s life. And that’s where there’s a little problem to overcome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The one complication is probably the idea that there is an ending in which Ciri can die in The Witcher 3,” explains Maher. Thankfully that ending, which is one of three different fates for Ciri and the outcome of several hidden choices made throughout the game, isn’t quite as clear cut as it may seem. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are hints in that ending that highlight the fact that she probably does not die,” says Maher. And so regardless of the events you personally witnessed at the end of your own Witcher 3 playthrough, the sequel will not “break any canon or even offend any canon.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We want to make sure that people that buy games for story will be able to experience the story in their own way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, there will be plenty of players coming to The Witcher 4 who have no knowledge of the events of the previous games, to whom the details of Ciri’s former adventures will mean little. CD Projekt Red is very aware that it’s been a decade since the release of Wild Hunt, and that a whole generation of fantasy fans who were too young for a mature-rated RPG back in 2015 will likely start their Witcher journey with the fourth game when it finally launches.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to aim for the new players,” says Małgorzata Mitręga, executive producer of The Witcher 4. “The wider audience, and also the people that know the franchise but who maybe do not play our games.” As such, The Witcher 4 is being pitched as the start of something new as much as it is the continuation of something old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of that, Kalemba and Mitręga explain that they’re ensuring The Witcher 4 is an approachable experience. They want “everyone who cares” to play. But there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the studio’s trademark RPG depth being watered down in payment for that approachability. “We create story-driven games, so we want to make sure that people that buy games for story, they'll be able to experience the story in their own way and they will be simply able to approach it,” Kalemba explains. “But people that are looking for specific challenges, they will also be able to experience the story in a challenging way.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio faces a much larger challenge than just crafting a sequel that’s approachable for newcomers, though. While Cyberpunk 2077 is now regarded as a landmark RPG, its launch was one of the highest-profile disasters in industry history. It took CD Projekt Red years to fix the game’s problems, a project necessary not only to make the game work, but also to save the company’s reputation. Those years were more than just transformative for Cyberpunk, though; the road to 2077’s notable comeback resulted in significant structural changes at CDPR. Changes that hopefully lay the groundwork for better things for The Witcher 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The way we produce right now has changed in a very good way,” says Kalemba. “We are very mindfully defining the stages of the production. We are very mindfully trying to scope it, making sure that the foundation is there. I already see that it’s helping us to make sure that whatever we create right now is super coherent across the board. This way makes us feel that we control this super complex environment more than we used to, and that also makes everyone feel more secure when it comes to developing generally on a daily basis.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are very mindfully trying to scope it, making sure that the foundation is there. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The governing rule among these new changes is “let it cook.” That’s evident in the way the studio has allowed more time for pre-production – The Witcher 4’s existence was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-confirms-a-new-witcher-game-is-in-development">publicly announced back in October 2022</a>, but it has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold">only just gone into full production</a>. But there have been other significant changes. During the development of Phantom Liberty, for example, the studio was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cyberpunk-2077s-most-complicated-boss-was-built-concept-to-controller">restructured into “content teams”</a> where multiple disciplines work together in tightly co-ordinated groups to create particular sequences and quests. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes aren’t just about ensuring game quality and a smooth eventual release, though. During the development of Cyberpunk 2077 it was reported that studio staff <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-studio-head-responds-to-mandatory-crunch-reports">endured long working hours and mandatory overtime demands</a>. Rewind the clock further back and CDPR faced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-studio-responds-to-crunch-accusations/1100-6422841/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar accusations while working on The Witcher 3</a>. The studio’s new approach aims to create a better working environment for the people making The Witcher 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that it's already helping [create a better working environment],” says Mitręga. “I guess that the way [forward is] to produce it in a healthy manner so that people still can find fun in what they do. And that's what is inspiring, that's what makes the quality so high. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are planning different ways we communicate with the teams,” she continues. “Teams are planned differently than we were [on Cyberpunk 2077], so it's already helping.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/main-feature-00-02-27-20-still004-1734010539850.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ciri will be a very different kind of witcher when she returns in her own saga. Image credit: The Witcher 3 / CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Red isn’t ready to reveal a launch date for The Witcher 4 yet, possibly as a result of that “let it cook” mantra. But, if the cinematic trailer is anything to go by, the recipe will have to be exact. While IGN visited the studio’s Warsaw HQ ahead of The Game Awards, the team explained that the trailer had gone through dozens and dozens of revisions, with each new version fine-tuning the presentation and delivery of The Witcher 4’s first story. CD Projekt Red has approached this cinematic with as much precision as it has the game at large, iterating over and over again until it’s exactly right.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Believe me, behind every single scene there was an intention,” says Kalemba. “There is, in any single frame, no coincidence in this trailer. We were building it in a way to sell a very, very coherent short story with a beginning and climax.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also wanted to have the full experience,” adds Mitręga. “Because this is coming home for the old [fans], but this is also an introduction for the new audience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a decade of waiting, nothing but a full experience would do for those old fans. And that’s what we have; the six-minute trailer tells not just a complete short story, but also contains all the hallmarks of a classic Witcher quest: a contract, a kill, and a consequence. For veterans of Geralt’s adventures, it's a good reminder of why it’s worth coming back for a fourth installment. As for new fans, it’s about as good a taste of The Witcher’s magic as you can get in advertisement form. No doubt The Witcher subreddit is about to be inundated with a thousand “how do I get into this?” posts (and if that is a question you have, then our chat with CD Projekt Red’s Witcher loremasters should be your next stop.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next, CD Projekt Red won’t say. With full production only just spun up, we could be in for another long wait until the next details about Ciri’s new adventure are ready to be shared. But what little the team was willing to share is already something to chew on with anticipation. The expectations around RPGs have shifted a lot since The Witcher 3 launched in 2015. Games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and CDPR’s own Cyberpunk 2077 have put deep emphasis on worlds that react, respond, bend, and break under the pressures inflicted by players. How The Witcher 4 will play with those expectations remains to be seen, but CDPR’s promise of a Ciri that can be defined by those who play as her is as good a place as any to start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, Ishizaki is no newcomer to the Soulslike genre, having been a member of the FromSoftware team since 2011’s Dark Souls, serving critical roles including level/battle designer on 2015’s Bloodborne and combat designer on Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a developer, I had many ideas for what could potentially be new games during the development of the past titles I've worked on, including Elden Ring,” Ishizaki told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This time I stepped up as a new director, I was given the opportunity to direct this idea for Nightreign. We've always been seen as a company that makes these Soulslikes or this kind of traditional formula of Soulslike games and so I saw this as an opportunity to do something different. To challenge both myself and the company to build something new while still using what we've cultivated with our previous titles.

The story picks up in Hayabusa Village after Ryu Hayabusa heads to America to avenge his father's death, as told in the NES version of Ninja Gaiden. Suddenly, the veil between the human and demon worlds has torn, opening a doorway to darkness in Hayabusa Village. Kenji Mozu, a young ninja of the Hayabusa clan, throws himself into battle, determined to protect his village and its people from a looming demonic threat in this dark and dangerous era.<br>Featuring a mastery of the high-speed, challenging combat the series is known for, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound’s side-scrolling action is immediately welcoming to newcomers - while offering a steep, rewarding sense of difficulty and intricate technical depth that will challenge the blade of even a seasoned ninja. Brutally slash through an array of fiendish foes and demons while avoiding deadly fiery traps, spike pits, chasms and more.<br>The young ninja, Kenji Mozu’s high-stakes quest develops with showstopping fights against powerful, boss-caliber behemoths.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p>The call to go beyond the stars is here once again, and it’s bigger, bolder, and more unpredictable than ever. We just revealed a first gameplay trailer for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> during The Game Awards 2024, promising a fresh <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,946 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> in a brand-new colony next year.  No really, we know we’re not supposed to promise things in marketing, but the setting is completely new, so this is all factual. Just don’t break the colony again. We’re looking at each of you who sent the Hope into the sun in the last game.</p><p>In true Obsidian Entertainment fashion, you carve your path through Arcadia, a colony teeming with factions, intrigue, and chaos. It’s also home of skip drive technology and where the fate of the entire colony – and the galaxy – rests. As a daring, undeniably good-looking, and questionably competent Earth Directorate agent, you’re tasked with uncovering the source of devastating rifts threatening the entire galaxy. Talk about stakes (not to be confused with raptidon steaks, those are very different)!  The choice of how to deal with the rifts is up to you. “Your worlds, your way,” as we say at Obsidian.</p><p>Are the rifts the only thing threatening Arcadia? Of course not! That would be too easy. A factional war between the “benevolent rulers” known as the Protectorate, a rebellious scientific religious order, and a corporate mega power has the colony torn apart. Each is trying to close or control the rifts for their own good/monetarily profitable needs. Church, state, and capitalism! Who will win?! Well, that’s really up to you. This is your game. We’ve said the choices were yours the whole time. See that Obsidian motto above? Yeah, you get it.</p><p>We’ve said choice a few times already, but guess what? This is an <a title="Genres > RPG [16,865 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> so it’s going to come up a few more times. When it comes to <a title="Genres > Crafting [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> your commander, it is full-on “RPG with RPG elements” time from ability points to skill checks in conversations, to even how flawed you want to be because, let’s admit it, no one is perfect. Except those who think they are. Look at you go. Being perfect.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>How you build your commander and chart your way through the narrative is uniquely yours as you plunge into this player-driven story. Whether you’re a disciple of diplomacy, a smart strategist, a crusader of chaos, or defiantly different (so we can keep the alliterations), the choice – you guessed it—is yours. Oh, and with this being <em><a title="Games > The Outer Worlds [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a></em>, yes, you can dumb!</p><p>While <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a single-player RPG, you won’t be alone! Not virtually anyway. Enlist a crew of companions to help you achieve your goals. Nothing says “middle <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>” more than sending people out to fight your fights for you, then having them judge everything you do with a visual reminder of how much they loved or hated it. Maybe you’ll help them fulfill their dreams or goals along the way. <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>rly you care enough about the people working with you to see their dreams realized… right?</p><p>As excitement grows for the upcoming 2025 launch, now is the perfect time to revisit <em>The Outer Worlds</em> and relive the adventure that started it all. Whether you’re a seasoned spacer or are setting foot in Halcyon for the first time, there’s no better moment to prepare for the next chapter. <em>The Outer Worlds</em> is available for purchase on <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,677 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,476 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Steam, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. You also can jump in today if you’re a Game Pass member.</p><p>On top of that, the universe is expanding beyond the game! <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be featured in the upcoming Secret Level anthology series, streaming on Prime Video. Tune in on December 17 for a short story that takes place between The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2. While you may have thought that was a lot of shilling, the Secret Level episode is legitimately good, and if the Board were around, they’d tell you it was mandatory viewing.</p><p>Wishlist the game today on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on Windows PC, and Steam, and stay tuned for more updates on <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>—we can’t wait to share what’s next with you. The galaxy is yours to explore; the only question is, how will you shape it?</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
