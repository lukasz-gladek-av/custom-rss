		<p>Vampire Survivors has become a genuine cultural phenomenon by this point and continues to add to this legacy with extra characters, tie-ins and more content for startlingly low prices. Perhaps more obvious than this, though, is the legion of clones and impersonators it has spawned in the emerging ‘bullet heaven’ genre. For those who follow new releases on Steam in particular it seems like a new one is announced and/or released every couple of days. The genre as a whole is in real risk of oversaturation and most examples disappear without much fanfare. Occasionally a new one brings something to the table, such as the fun Karate Survivor and the Diablo-like Halls of Torment. Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel stays relatively faithful to the established bullet heaven formula, but adds a level of graphical polish that stands out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cF16KwbeXuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In its Early Access form, there isn’t a vast amount of content in Jotunnslayer just, so it’s a little early to judge how satisfying the full game will be. In fact, I’d probably go so far as to say that you are paying for an extended demo with the promise of a fully fleshed out experience – something that is becoming a familiar story with Early Access titles. There are two maps and four characters, with four gods that offer boons in a style similar to Hades. The devs have a clear roadmap laid out for the full release which will increase the number of characters, skills, maps, and gods.</p>



<p>At the start of the game you have a choice of either melee Berserker or the midrange magic user Seeress, with Revenant (archer) and Flame Sister (magic user) unlocked as you progress. Each class has their own set of skills and unique level-ups to choose from, whilst all can benefit from the different Divine boons. At present Thor, Freya, Loki, and Odin are available and they each offer active skills and passive power-ups. Thor is all about strength and thunder spells, whilst Loki offers poison attacks and the potential for more pickups. As you might expect, these are randomly offered with every playthrough being different. There is clear potential for some powerful builds here and the fusion of Hades and Vampire Survivors is a fantastic idea.</p>

<p>Rather than room navigation of Hades, however, you fight on static maps which are far more contained than the sprawling levels in Vampire Survivors. Each run has more of an actual point than many Bullet Heaven games, with a randomised selection of miniquests to complete in order to unlock the run boss. The bosses are massive and intimidating foes that will challenge your builds and use of skills to the max. Initial runs on Easy take only 10 minutes, with the increasing difficulty levels also increasing the duration. As always, level ups and skills are restricted to the specific playthrough but you can upgrade your characters and Gods in the skill tree between runs to receive permanent improvements.</p>

<p>Jotunnslayer is perhaps the best looking Bullet Heaven game I’ve played and the core game is just as addictive and enjoyable as the genre’s best. What is needed, however is more content as the progression just isn’t rewarding enough to keep you playing right now, and the jump in difficulty requires a fair amount of grinding. I will definitely return to the game as more is added, but don’t feel compelled to complete everything that is here just yet. A very promising start and one to keep an eye on for the full release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-advertising-rules-for-steam-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve has a new dedicated page that explains what types of advertisements are supported and not supported on Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steam has always had these advertising rules. However, recently, a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new page</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming on Linux</a> has appeared to explain these rules and clarify that the platform doesn’t contain paid advertising or models. The page also explains what constitutes “advertising” in a game, what types of ads developers can implement, and what advertisements shouldn’t be in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-types-of-ads-are-allowed-on-steam">What types of ads are allowed on Steam?</h2>



<p>Steam allows ads with product placement, which includes “real brands, products, personalities, etc., as part of gameplay.” This advertising is accepted when it does not disrupt anything and matches the context of the game—for example, sponsor logos in sports games like football, Formula 1, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-promotions are also allowed, such as promoting bundles, sale events, and more. Players can also include other Steam products or products/brands outside of Steam; however, it’s not allowed “to charge other developers to participate in a bundle or to sell access to a sale page or other page on Steam.” Lastly, developers can also run paid advertising campaigns to increase traffic to their Steam product pages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-types-of-ads-are-not-allowed-on-steam">What types of ads are not allowed on Steam?</h2>



<p>Coming to the ads that will lead to your game being banned on Steam. Devs are not allowed to “utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game,” meaning you can’t entice players into watching ads to play or gate gameplay behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the game’s business model depends on advertising, the developers must remove those elements before releasing it on Steam. They can also create a single-purchase “paid app” or use microtransactions and DLCs by making the game free to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the wrong use of advertising, such as creating value for the player, will not be allowed. This means developers can’t put rewards or unique content behind ads on Steam games. Lastly, developers cannot “charge other developers for access to Steam features. These include sale pages, bundles, store pages, franchise pages, etc.”</p>



<p>In other news, Steam now warns players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before they purchase an “abandoned” game</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wreckfest 2 is arriving</a> on the platform on March 20. What are your thoughts on Valve’s advertising rules for Steam games? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched an investigation into Roblox.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation">Bloomberg</a>, while the investigation is ongoing, the exact focus of the SEC's probing remains unclear. The commission did however acknowledge the investigation was active, and said it could not currently share full details to ensure there was "no harm to the ongoing enforcement proceeding".</p>
<p>The SEC was established after the 1929 Wall Street crash in a bid to protect American citizens from market manipulation. It requires public companies to submit quarterly and annual reports, as well as investigate possible violations of the securities laws.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that there are responsive emails between Enforcement staff referencing Roblox and that these emails are a part of an active and ongoing investigation," an SEC spokesperson told Bloomberg, via a Freedom of Information request: </p>
<p>Bloomberg suggests - though it is not confirmed - that the investigation may pertain to November's report that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">Roblox misled investors by falsely reporting player numbers, and has highlighted yet more examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared via the platform</a>.</p>
<p>In response to November's report, Roblox said at the time that it "rejects" its findings and pointed to previously-released details of its efforts to try and combat inappropriate content. It also stressed that it had previously acknowledged that "fraud and unauthorised access to [its] platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent last week</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cheery mom-and-pop computer game business Valve have created a new Steamworks page for their policy about in-game adverts and advertising in general, with a troubleshooter's list of dos and don'ts for developers.</p>
<p>As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve's handling of such things hasn't really changed over the past few years, but I can't pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can't bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.</p><!--more-->
<p>Briefly, Valve say it's fine to feature ads inside games if it's "appropriate within the context of the game". Not fine: the use of paid advertising as a business model, as with ports of mobile games that make you watch an advert to unlock stuff, or that dole out rewards for willingly filling your eyes with footage of, say, crypto investors pitching a new wellness diet. If your game makes use of such strategies on other platforms, explain Valve, you will need to strip them out before selling them on Steam. They suggest switching to a single-purchase model or free-to-play with microtransactions instead.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising">Steamworks Documentation post</a> in question - spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/">GamingOnLinux</a> - is quite cut-and-dried on the surface, but ambiguity predictably sneaks in as you start to thrash out the use-case scenarios for a store that gets thousands of new releases a year. Here's what it says about in-game ads being fine as long as they fit the context.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Games may contain real brands, products, personalities, etc as part of gameplay, provided such portrayals are not disruptive and are appropriate within the context of the game. For example, a racing game might feature real life sponsor logos on its race cars, or a skateboard game might include characters wearing real-world brands. Note that all developers must obtain the relevant permission and/or licenses for any copyrighted content contained in their games."</p></blockquote>
<p>There's an interesting tradition of product placement within games, ranging from signboards for pirate sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overboard">Overboard</a>! in the otherwise galleon-deficient G-Police, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/10/obama-campaign/">Obama campaign ads in Burnout Paradise</a>. You can definitely make the case for ads forming a believable aspect of the setting, but even when it's credible, I can't help but ponder what might have been sacrificed in order to meet the client spec. Publishers have, unsurprisingly, expressed qualified approval for the idea. Last year, EA's Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-thinking-about-inserting-adverts-into-games-but-dont-worry-itll-be-very-thoughtful">promised</a> that any such future measures undertaken by the Battlefield publisher would be "very thoughtful".</p><p>Among the more egregious examples of noxious in-game advertising is the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a>, would you believe. Alan might sporadically style himself an arthouse novelist, but he's not above <a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-remastered-is-ditching-the-energizer-batterie-1847658945">flying the flag for Verizon and Energizer</a>. Examples of doing it right include the recent reality TV sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">The Crush House</a>, in which you play both the producer and target audience of adverts for other Devolver games.</p>
<p>The Steamworks page adds that "cross-promotional activities on Steam, such as bundles, sale events, and more" are OK-dokey as well. Under what's not allowed, meanwhile, we find the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising. If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase "paid app," or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."</p></blockquote>
<p>While mandatory ad-watching tends to be associated with mobile, console and PC publishers have tried it too. 2K <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/nba-2k21-inserts-unskippable-ads-pre-game-loading-screens/">once added unskippable ads to NBA 2K21</a>, for instance, rolling them back after an outcry.</p>
<p>The post further comments that devs "should not use advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p>
<p>With my shitpost hat firmly jammed down around my devil's advocate horns, I feel that weaving an advert into a setting that absolutely doesn't support adverts would be a thrilling designer's challenge. "Perhaps it deserves a gamejam", I impishly say aloud to myself, smiling at the torch-waving hordes of Steam users outside my window. Here's some homework for the comments: how would you advertise, say, Papa Johns in The Lord Of The Rings? It shouldn't be that tricky, really, given that the Orcs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY4V3UUY95A">already familiar with the concept of menus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Themed cosmetics, pens, stamps, incense, and various items of apparel would be easy to reproduce, but I'd argue are fairly boring choices for a series known for its outlandish characters and side quests.</p>
<p>Better yet are karaoke instruments (from the memorable minigame), a Sujimon card set (from that other minigame), Ichiban Confectionery's rice crackers (yes, from a minigame), or a Michio Ono figure (you guessed it...).</p>
<p>No doubt the Majima body pillow will be a popular choice, as will character lingerie, and various themed underpants.</p>
<p>A Like a Dragon board game is intriguing, presuming it's fully playable, as would a Ryu ga Gotoku recipe book considering all the delicious in-game food throughout the series.</p>
<p>No doubt the Big Pylon will win, though - it's literally a traffic cone that's formed a running gag since the first game.</p>
<p>The first Yakuza game was released on PS2 in 2005 in Japan, followed by an international release the following year. The series has more recently taken on its Japanese name Like a Dragon.</p>
<p>After last year's celebrated Infinite Wealth, which had the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date"> series' most successful launch on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">hit 1m sales in its first week</a>, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set to launch later this month on 21st February. It'll receive a welcome <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-getting-new-game-plus-in-free-post-launch-update">New Game Plus mode in a free post-launch update</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake doing better than anticipated, Square Enix still reported a drop in video game profits by almost 10% over the past year.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> for the first nine months of the current fiscal year ending on March 31st, the Japanese publisher confirmed net sales for its Digital Entertainment sector have dropped 10.7% and operating income 9.9% due to the weak performance of mobile and browser-based games and to the low sales of games released this year compared to the sales of those released the previous fiscal year, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. Still, some of the publisher's new releases did well, as the Dragon Quest HD-2D Remake sold better than expected. The Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail expansion also sold well and has driven an increase in the MMO segment profits over the previous year.</p>
<p>The results reported in the latest financial report aren't particularly surprising, considering how Square Enix reported last September how sales of<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/"> Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth did not meet expectations</a>, expectations that were reportedly reasonable this time. Thankfully, the second entry in the Remake trilogy seems to be doing quite well on<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC</a>, so there's the chance that sales will eventually meet the publisher's expectations. It definitely would be a shame for such a good game to be considered a failure in terms of sales.</p>

            <p>Better get yer cigar chompin' mouth muscles warmed up. Second world war sabotage 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-origins">Commandos: Origins</a> now has a release date, and it's fairly soon. Good news for people who enjoy sniping fascists from across the map while commanding a barrel-armed Irishmen to simultaneously slit a throat. And equally good news for those who lament the loss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun">Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun</a> developer Mimimi Games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This reboot is coming out on April 9th, said developers Claymore Game Studios in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1479730/view/501690406746980951">a Steam post</a>. "After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development, and the invaluable community feedback from various playtests - operation ‘Release’ is a go," said studio director Jürgen Reusswig.</p>
<p>But maybe you don't have all the requisite wrinkles to remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-behind-enemy-lines">Commandos</a>? They were a series of tough top-down tactics games that saw the player infiltrate axis territory during World War 2. They looked like real-time strategy games but were really all about high-stakes stealth. That, and trying to find the one good angle your sniper could actually shoot from.</p>
<p>This follow-up will have 10 missions in wartime locales like the North African desert and snowy Scandinavia, and you'll be able to slink through Nazi encampments slashing necks with a pal in two-player co-op (both online or split-screen). Nic played a demo during last autumn's Next Feast, and walked away <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commandos-origins-looks-like-a-solid-and-satisfying-return-for-the-legendary-tactics-series">feeling broadly positive</a> about all the meticulously timed soldier strangling. He also dropped a wardrobe on the heads of two unsuspecting Nazis. What's not to like?</p><p>Publisher Kalypso Media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commandos-acquired-by-kalypso-media">bagged the rights to the Commandos</a> games back in 2018 and promptly got to work <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kalypso-have-set-up-a-new-commandos-game-studio">setting up a studio</a> to revive the series. The resultant reboot will be flying the flag for the stealth tactics genre after the demise of Mimimi Games, who basically revived and modernised all the ideas of old-school Commandos games when they made Shadow Tactics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>. These were all well-liked games by folks here at RPS. Sadly, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">closed down in the summer of 2023</a>, with the founders of the studio citing exhaustion as the main reason they were downing tools.  </p>
<p>"We cherished every game we made and feel proud of what we were able to accomplish as a studio," they said when announcing the closure. "At the same time, dedicating the past decade and a half of our lives working on increasingly ambitious games took a heavy personal toll on us and our families."</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Claymore learn from Mimimi's work, and what ideas of their own they'll inject (or re-inject?) into the genre. Although Edwin has just soldier-crawled into the room wearing two stripes of boot polish on his face to pass on some intelligence. He says monastery stealth game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monastery-escape-tactics-sim-the-stone-of-madness-is-out-now-and-has-me-thinking-about-time">The Stone Of Madness</a> from the Balsphemous developers is also keeping the genre alive. This is a promising sign. Dismissed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite the long silence, the Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate development team is still hard at work on it, and more information will be revealed slowly over time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a> today, series creator Yuji Horii commented on the game during the latest livestream held with his radio show group KosoKoso Hoso Kyuoku over the weekend, saying that the development team is still hard at work on the game, and he hopes to reveal more information on the game little by little. Sadly, the legendary game designer did not say anything more on the matter, but still, it's good to hear that Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate is still in the works, as it has been a very long time since we got a solid update on the game.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the next main entry in the long-running JRPG series, other than the fact that it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and that<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/"> Orca is co-developing the game</a>. The Japanese studio previously worked on Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age and its Definitive Edition, so it's not surprising to see them back working on the next entry in the series, which promises to shake up things considerably, as it will feature an overhauled version of the series' trademark command battle system.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate isn't the only entry in the series to be in the works. Later this year, the Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D remakes will be released on PC and consoles, continuing the Erdrick saga following the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">remake of the third entry in the series</a> released last November.</p>

            <p>The RPS review of Firaxis' grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilisation 7</a> is currently <em>in progress</em>. We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">awarding it two out of a possible five beetles</a>. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">statement last Friday</a> following feedback from the game's advanced access period.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In response to your feedback, we’ve identified three key areas that we’re prioritizing work against as quickly as possible," say Firaxis. They're planning to share a roadmap "soon", but this is what they're working on for now. Chief among the three areas is a focus on improving the UI - their "top priority", they say. They're working on "making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more". Do love a good "more". Could be anything! Exciting!</p>
<p>As for multiplayer, they're working on the following:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, they're aiming to roll out a quality o' life patch in March, featuring "quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes".</p>
<p>In other Civ news, Firaxis announced <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmHvLykP-HI">Civ 7 VR yesterday</a>, exclusive to ZuckQuest 3 and 3s. I will never stand to play a strategy game and you cannot make me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Diablo creator David Brevik has shared his distaste for some aspects in current ARPGs, and said that when the journey to levelling up is shortened "you've cheapened the entire experience".</p>
<p>Brevik, now head of indie publisher Skystone Games, spoke to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/diablo-creator-david-brevik-doesnt-vibe-with-todays-rapid-arpgs/">VideoGamer</a> about his career and his thoughts on the ARPG genre. Brevik was co-founder and president of Blizzard North and served as lead programmer and senior designer on Diablo, and project and design lead on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>.</p>
<p>In the interview, Brevik criticised the speed at which games today offer player progression, which he believes spoils the pacing.</p>

<p>"I think that RPGs in general have started to lean into this: kill swathes of enemies all over the place extremely quickly," said Brevik. "Your build is killing all sorts of stuff so you could get more drops, you can level up, and the screen is littered with stuff you don't care about."</p>
<p>Enemy counts in the original Diablo games were notably high for the time, but Brevik believes modern games have learned the wrong lesson.</p>
<p>"I don't find that as kind of personal and realistic as like Diablo 2. The pacing on Diablo 2, I think is great," he said. "That's one of the reasons it's endured. I just don't find killing screen-fulls of things instantly and mowing stuff down and walking around the level and killing everything, very enticing. I just don't feel like that is a cool experience. I find it kind of silly.</p>
<p>"When you're shortening that journey and making it kind of ridiculous. You've cheapened the entire experience, in my opinion."</p>
<p>While Brevik's comments apply to the recent Diablo games, it also arguably applies to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>. And MMOs also suffer from similar faults.</p>
<p>"I think that MMOs have definitely pushed in that direction," said Brevik. "How fast can you level? How fast can you kill everything? It's all about speed and things like that, but, in reality, I just think that makes a kind of a worse experience. And I tend to shy away from that direction."</p>
<p>Blizzard has followed the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> with a number of seasons and major expansion Vessel of Hatred to extend its longevity, while also battling with endgame imbalances. The expansion's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-boosts-steam-players-to-record-high-despite-rocky-launch">launch in October last year was rocky</a> but still led to a boost in Steam players.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-first-major-patch-brings-big-changes-to-endgame-content">received a major patch last month</a> after its early access release in December, which made big changes to its endgame.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite some streamlining over its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is most definitely not the most accessible role-playing game around. Following the long introduction, where you are taught the very basics of the experience, the game essentially leaves you on your own to figure everything out by experimenting, which can lead to frustration, as at the beginning of the game, Henry is not very good at anything, and the poor gear in your possession will help you little in combat. Thankfully, there is a quest you can complete that will give you a decent headstart in the game and help you have fun even during the first few hours of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210113926_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To complete the Wedding Crashers main story quest, which is the very first quest you have to complete after Henry and Hans part ways in Troskowitz, you have two different options - either get into the wedding part with the help of the blacksmith Radovan or with the help of the miller Kreyzl. If you are a newcomer to the series, and you are feeling overwhelmed by the many mechanics, the game is already asking you to understand at the beginning of the adventure, your best choice is to ask for Radovan's help for a few reasons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210112934_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After reaching Tachov to the north of Troskowitz and speaking with Radovan, you will learn how to craft items, which is an excellent way to earn a few Groschen and purchase items you may need, such as food. Don't spend your money on weapons and gear yet, however, as you will soon after get the chance to obtain plenty of free gear.</p>
<p>After completing the blacksmithing tutorial, you will not only get a free bed, allowing you to rest and recover health as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions/">save your game</a> without having to use a Saviour Schnapps potion, but you will also get access to an additional Kingdom Come: Deliverance II story quest called The Jaunt where Henry will join the lord of Semine and his faithful guard Sir Gnarly to track down a lost cart.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210112909_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before venturing forth with the two men, you should head over to the stables, where you can reunite with Pebbles, Henry's horse, potentially for free if you can pass a skill check. Otherwise, you can purchase the horse for a relatively low sum or even try to steal the horse and register it to yourself by the Horse handler in the Nomad Camp to the east of Semine, although you will still need some Groschen to do so. If you are stealing, however, it may make more sense to steal a better horse than Pebbles at this point and then reclaim him at a later time when you have the coin.</p>
<p>While it will take more time to complete the quest, you can complete The Jaunt quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II without a horse, so if you are not able to reclaim Pebbles, you should definitely still proceed. After traveling through a few different locations, Henry and the two older men will have to fight some bandits, and if you don't feel confident in your combat skills yet, you can choose to stay in the back and shoot the bandits from afar with a crossbow. Once the bandits are dead, you can loot them of their possessions, which includes weapons and gear that are more than decent to give you a headstart in the game. With this gear, you should have no trouble completing a few other essentially starting quests, which include the Combat Training I quest, where you can learn the extremely useful Master Strike ability, and the Mutt quest to find Henry's loyal canine companion.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation owners impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-psn-is-still-down-after-12-hours">this weekend's major PSN outage</a> have criticised Sony's apology offer, as well as the lack of explanation on what went wrong. 
</p>
<p>
The latest period of PSN downtime lasted nearly 24 hours, beginning early Friday evening here in the UK. When the service did return, Sony apologised and blamed a vague "operational issue" as the cause.
</p>
<p>
Compensation for the outage amounts to five additional days for anyone with a PS Plus subscription, but nothing for others who were also locked out of playing digital games.

<p>
Not all online games require PS Plus, of course - including free-to-play behemoths like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Roblox - and access to these was also unavailable.
</p>
<p>
"Everything was down," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-playstation-plus-members-will-automatically-receive-an-additional-5-days-of-service-for-the-psn-outage.1104324/page-3#post-135525930">one impacted user wrote on ResetEra</a>. "People that game share (like me) were locked out of their entire digital library, including offline games. You didn't need PS Plus to be affected."
</p>
<p>
"I don't have PS Plus but still couldn't play the games I wanted to," opined another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1il7ibh/sony_is_giving_some_compensation/">impacted user on reddit</a>. "Guess I'm a f***ing second class citizen."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony to ask if the company plans any other form of compensation, and to ask again about the cause of this weekend's outage. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation fans have been left in the dark about the root cause of the downtime - and what steps Sony is now taking to ensure it is not repeated again anytime soon.

            <p>Valve has implemented new rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising">new rules from Valve</a> - available online and first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/">Gaming on Linux</a> - confirm that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not.</p>
<p>Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p>

<p>"Developers should not utilise paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rules explain.</p>
<p>"If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase 'paid app', or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."</p>
<p>Whilst I suspect most of us would associate this kind of behaviour with mobile games more than those available on Steam, Valve clearly thought it necessary to clarify, in clear English, "what is and is not supported on Steam".</p>
<p>Developers are also not allowed to charge other developers for access to Steam features, such as sale pages, bundles, store fronts, or franchise pages.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Valve quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature</a> warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mere days after its debut, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 already has a thriving modding community. We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> a lot of convenience mods to make the game a bit less tedious for those who don't enjoy that side of the franchise. Now, it's time for the first graphics enhancement mods. Nexus Mods user SweeJ24 has uploaded a 3.4GB <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/263?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skins mod</a> that greatly increases the skin details of the game's characters by replacing all faces and all body diffuse textures for both males and females. There are reportedly minor seams at the moment, but the detail enhancement is already big, making it more than worthwhile. The default textures in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 are 1K, so the mod offers a 4x resolution improvement.</p>
<p><iframe title="CRT FACES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACAvdOyjbDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the author, the initial load might be a little longer, but afterward, it should be the same as vanilla. They also did not report any performance impact, although that was with the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card.</p>
<p>No doubt there will be many more graphics mods coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game was a resounding success both critically and commercially (it has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> one million units, recouping development costs). The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a perfect score</a> here on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>

The game was previously available on <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/">Itch</a> for three years without issue.</p>
<p>This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below.

<p>Here is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/b0tster.yeag.gay/post/3lhjt5ufa722a">an animated recap</a> of events by Walther herself.</p>

Could MarkScan perhaps be acting a touch overzealously here? From The Verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>MarkScan has previously made headlines for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/markscan-takedown/">taking down World Cup sites that weren’t even streaming the World Cup</a>, and asking Google to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sony-flags-its-own-website-for-repeat-copyright-infringements-220724/">remove <em>some of Sony’s own websites</em> on Sony’s behalf</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is generally the case whenever they see a.) a cathedral in real life b.) a British person looking a bit under the weather or c.) a normal rat, some fans have broken out the Bloodbornium and declared these events undeniable portents that it is, once again, huffin' season.

			<p>New ideas and directions are hard to find in the gaming peripheral space. Controllers do what controllers do, and for many people, the official PlayStation and Xbox controllers are as far as it goes. However, there’s a healthy competition for our fingers and thumbs rumbling away, with controllers now one of the most hotly contested sectors in gaming. Turtle Beach have come a long way from being purely a headset maker, and their latest, the Stealth Pivot, ploughs a new direction by having what can only be described as a split personality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Stealth Pivot Wireless Smart Controller: Rank Up To Revolutionary Control" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZROD3n_VBNw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I loved the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a>, cementing the fact that Turtle Beach are onto A Good Thing in the controller space. Where that brought in new technology in the shape of a colour OLED screen for a bit of high-tech gloss, the Pivot is more of a Swiss Army Knife of controllers, letting you switch between a standard controller layout or a fighting/retro focussed one. It’s a brilliant idea, even if it’s answering an unasked question for many gamers.</p>


<p>The Pivot looks pretty familiar, taking its overall design influence from the Official Xbox Controller. Despite that, it’s primarily aimed at PC and Mobile players with Xbox functionality available if you’re wired up. On PC the best performance comes either wired or via the 2.4gHz USB-A wireless dongle, while Bluetooth will let you hop in with your mobile or Apple TV-esque device. In the hand, it’s weighty and solid, fashioned from good quality plastics.</p>
<p>The magic comes with its namesake. It’s called the Pivot for the two pivoting sections on the face of the controller. These rotate between a standard asymmetrical Xbox-esque layout and a six-button lineup, shifting the D-pad into a more accessible position for your thumb. All you need to do is flip the controller over, release the locking switches and rotate the controller faces to your desired position.</p>

<p>It’s an ingenious bit of tech, a more practical and immediate cousin to the Thrustmaster eSwap’s controller modules, and it’s super satisfying just to tinker with. I have to admit, I’ve found myself messing with it before starting a game, even if I don’t need the fighting game layout.</p>

<p>So that this all fits into one controller, there’ve been two necessary changes, and they do affect how the Pivot feels in your hand, and in use. Firstly, the Pivot is a bit on the chonky side. In order for the pivoting mechanism to fit in, they’ve had to make it thicker, and if you’ve got smaller hands, it is a noticeable change. Personally, it didn’t affect my time using the Pivot, but I noticed it every single time I picked it up.</p>
<p>The second alteration is to the analogue sticks. As we’re seeing with more and more controllers, these are anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, which means they should last you a heck of a lot longer than the sticks in either the DualSense or Xbox Controller thanks to their magnetic technology removing the physical friction that wears on traditional sticks.</p>
<p>However, the sticks need to fit within the body of the controller when you rotate them away, with a twisting mechanism releasing them so that you can be tucked inside. It’s clever, and feels pretty solid, though I have to wonder whether it removes the advantages given by the Hall Effect sticks if you’re the kind of person – like me – to mess with the controller’s layout every single time you play. Being so weirdly enjoyable that you want to mess with it, increasing the wear on all the parts around he sticks, is probably a problem that the designers haven’t spent too much time on.</p>

<p>Because they need to be rotated away, both sticks are noticeably shorter than you’ll be used to. It’s far more noticeable to your muscle memory than the rest of the controller’s body, and it’s an oddity that may well be too much for some players to get over. On top of that, the sticks’ resistance is lower than I would like, giving less feedback to your movements and reducing the premium feel.</p>
<p>There’s some benefit to the reduced resistance and shorter sticks though, particularly the ability to change direction quicker, and if you’re a fighting game fan that prefers an analogue stick input, this could make it easier to fire off your directional inputs. That comes at a cost to precision, so if you’re into competitive FPS titles, you might want to look elsewhere. That’s backed up in our testing, with Gamepad Tester delivering a worrying 13.4% accuracy error, with the circularity over-emphasising the four main directions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it doesn’t have some shooter chops, as the Pivot boasts the near essential short trigger stops for your analogue triggers – seriously, every controller should have these. Further up on the back of the Pivot, you’ll find two easily identified toggles, each of which shortens the travel of the triggers so that they effectively become buttons. There’s only two trigger stop settings, instead of the more typical three, with the standard analogue trigger travel being shorter than you’d find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this improves your reaction speed when you’re lining up a headshot, and through plenty of rounds of Overwatch 2, the Pivot was no slouch. However, not having a longer travel similar, for example, to an Xbox controller can reduce the precision you want for racing games.</p>

<p>The Stealth Pro isn’t the only Turtle Beach controller with a screen, as the Pivot steals one of its killer features. This is a much smaller version though, and monochrome, but it still lets you make a series of on-the-fly changes to your controller’s setup. You can receive alerts from your mobile phone, change the mapping for the buttons and D-pad, and also switch the plastic slider’s functionality, though only for audio controls and not any of the central buttons – this seems a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>No matter which face button layout you’ve gone for, each of the membrane buttons feel good in use, with an expected level of travel. Both D-pads feel great, and given the attention that’s been lavished on them, it feels safe to say that the Pivot is aimed squarely at the fighting game crowd, with the option to play anything else at the flick of a switch.</p>

<p>Beyond the expected buttons, the Pivot also has a pair of extra rear buttons that are a placed unusually, but do still sit just underneath your middle fingers. I think this is actually my preferred layout for back buttons, though, and only having two reduces the chance of accidental activation – if you’re a fully-immersed back button/paddle aficionado, you might want a couple more.</p>
<p>The Pivot isn’t the only controller taking this unusual approach to variety gaming. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">Victrix Pro BFG</a>&nbsp;is a great option, though its alternative button layouts need to be screwed in and out of the controller housing so it doesn’t have the immediacy of the Pivot. The trigger lockouts are a lot more finicky too. My personal favourite solution to this question remains the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2 Pro</a>, whose magnetic units are a doodle to swap in and out, and it comes in at the same £119.99 pricepoint, though it’s only available as a wired option which won’t be for everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few days after the originally intended launch window of late January, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a> has finally been released to the public for the most part. NVIDIA RTX Kit can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTX-Kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GitHub</a>, though each component also has a dedicated repository. This includes what was arguably the most exciting and future-facing technology: RTX Neural Shaders, now abbreviated as <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXNS</a>. Here's the excerpt from its dedicated GitHub page:</p>
<p><em>The sample is intended as a starting point for developers interested in bringing Machine Learning (ML) to their graphics applications. It provides a number of examples to help the reader understand how to train their own neural networks and then use those models to perform inference alongside their normal graphics rendering.</em></p>
<p><em>RTXNS uses the Slang shading language and it utilises the Vulkan Cooperative Vectors extension to provide access to the GPUs ML acceleration.</em></p>
<p>RTX Neural Materials is not yet available as part of the RTX Kit suite, but practically everything else is. For example, RTX Neural Texture Compression includes a demo sample that can be compiled to demonstrate the memory-saving technology. Compusemble did just that, finding massively reduced memory consumption (from 272 to 11.37 MB), although there is a performance cost associated when enabling the NTC AI inference model.</p>
<p><iframe title="First Look At RTX Neural Texture Compression (BETA) On RTX 4090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9VAloduypg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Similarly, RTX Mega Geometry (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXMG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXMG</a>) can be tested by compiling a new sample. This is the only technology that's already been used in a game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>), but the tech demo is nonetheless interesting.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry Tech Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js-ps14csLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>RTX Character Rendering (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXCR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXCR</a>) is also available, providing a sample of how to render path traced hair and skin. Hair is particularly interesting because, with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, NVIDIA introduced hardware support for a new hair data structure called Linear-Swept Sphere (LSS). According to NVIDIA, this delivers high performance in tracing and BVH updates while maintaining exceptionally low memory consumption. Compared to Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS), rendering animated hair on humans is about 2x faster with LSS and requires one-fifth of the VRAM. We'll see the first example of RTX Hair with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle February update</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The RTX Kit also includes one technology that NVIDIA had not previously discussed at CES 2025: RTX Texture Filtering (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXTF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXTF</a>). According to NVIDIA, RTXTF randomly samples textures after shading and filters difficult volumes, reducing artifacts and improving image quality.</p>
<p>Lastly, NVIDIA also <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Streamline/releases/tag/v2.7.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated its Streamline SDK to version 2.7.2</a>, adding support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the new models for Ray Reconstruction, Frame Generation, and Super Resolution. This means we might soon see the first DLSS 4 mods.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest 12 is still in development, series creator Yuji Horii has confirmed.</p>
<p>The latest in the long-running RPG series was first announced back in 2021 but little has been seen since beyond the initial teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, Horii held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfikAAlgNsw">livestream</a> with this radio show group KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/">Automaton</a>) where he confirmed the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest 12".</p>

<p>Further details are expected to be released little by little, though nothing more was revealed at this time.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://x.com/YujiHorii/status/1794984625107832939">Horii also acknowledged Dragon Quest 12</a> on social media, stating the development team wanted to make a game "worthy of the final contributions of the two people who passed away".</p>
<p>Those two people are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama</a> and composer Koichi Sugiyama, who had worked on every game in the series before their deaths.</p>
<p>Horii's comments came shortly after Dragon Quest series producer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-yu-miyake-stepping-down-as-producer-on-dragon-quest">Yu Miyake stepped down from his role</a> to oversee <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s mobile game division, putting Dragon Quest 12's development into question.</p>
<p>Now, in his livestream, Horii apologised for confusion around the game's development and denied it had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Little else is known about Dragon Quest 12, though at the series' 35th anniversary livestream Horii stated the classic turn-based battle system will be altered and the tone will be darker and aimed at adults.</p>
<p>In its latest earnings report, Square Enix stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake exceeded sales expectations</a>. Previously it reported sales of 2m copies, with the game becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">2024's biggest game in Japan</a> after just a week on sale.</p>
<p>While similar remakes of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are expected this year, anticipation is building for the next full release in the series to build on the success of Dragon Quest 3.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the crowd cheered to spins on hits from records like DAMN and GNX, appearances from stars like Samuel Jackson and SZA helped take the show to new heights. Of course, there were plenty of references to Lamar’s infamous 2024 beef with Drake, too, but what audiences didn’t expect was how the Super Bowl performer chose to finally close the door on the former Degrassi star. As the lights went down, the words “Game Over” could be seen illuminated on the side of the stadium, while the stage was revealed to feature PlayStation’s iconic cross, circle, triangle, and square symbols.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show was always going to be seen as a victory lap when it came to his beef with Drake, but bringing Sony into the fight to finally close that chapter in grand fashion felt especially brutal. Although it’s not quite clear why the To Pimp a Butterfly artist chose to seemingly channel PlayStation for the end of his year-long fight, music and gaming fans have taken to social media to share their appreciation for the dig nonetheless. At the very least, Lamar’s already great performance might be better on rewatch once you realize the stage is one big video game reference.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar brought out the PlayStation symbols and said "Game Over" 😭<a href="https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G</a></p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1888766562750148721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the stage for Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl performance has the PlayStation controller buttons 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/DnkrJGRDtI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DnkrJGRDtI</a></p>— Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1888764872353022049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Serena Williams, Samuel Jackson, PlayStation references, the GNX, the whole stadium yelling "AMINORR" ugh the dancers in red, white &amp; blue, SZA?!

      Bismuth explains the unreasonable luck needed for a record-setting Tyson fight at around the 56:30 mark in this 2024 video.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Summoning Salt says Tyson here gave him a "perfect pattern" during his first phase of endless uppercuts, something that happens only 1 in 1,600 bouts. And later in the fight, the game's random-number generator cooperated by adding only an extra 16 frames of delay (~0.8 in-game seconds) compared to a "perfect" run. Combined, Summoning Salt estimates that Tyson will only punch this quickly once every 7,000 to 10,000 attempts.</p>
<p>"It's over," Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2376320266">said live on Twitch</a> when the record-setting match was finished, in a surprisingly even tone that came over what sounds very much like a dropped controller. "I thought I'd be a lot more excited about this. Holy shit, dude! It's fucking over... Dude, am I dreaming right now? ... I'm sorry I'm so quiet. I'm kind of in shock right now that that just happened."</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>With his near-perfect combination of both skill and luck, Summoning Salt's new record surpasses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_wvPExoOg8">his own previous world record</a> of precisely 2:00.00 on the in-game clock. That mark, set just eight months ago, was just three frames off of displaying 1:59 on the in-game timer for the first time.</p>
<p>Summoning Salt was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YMOqycF2yQ">the first runner to break the 2:01 barrier on Tyson</a> in 2020, a feat he has since replicated just 15 times over tens of thousands of attempts. "There's essentially no difference between all of those [2:00.xx] fights and this one, except I got better luck from Tyson on this fight," he writes. "Finally, after nearly half a decade, the 1:59 has happened."</p>

    <p>
      Summoning Salt discusses the difficulty of beating 2:13 on Tyson in 2020, months before setting a then-record time of 2:00 himself

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Ironically, just before posting his first 2:00.xx fight in 2020, Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR9ypSOTGQ&amp;t=2440s">posted a video</a> discussing in part just how difficult it was for speedrunners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELep5djy_kU">to beat Matt Turk's 2007 record of 2:13 on Tyson</a>. "For years it was just this impossibly fast time that the top players just couldn't get close to," Summoning Salt said at the time. "Of course, other top players fought Tyson years later, but their best efforts came up short... they couldn't touch it. It stood alone."</p>
<p>Summoning Salt is now just over a second off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sgQ7BuEpIM">the tool-assisted speedrun record of 1:58.61</a>, which uses emulated gameplay to fight a theoretical "perfect" bout every time. But after spending years on what he writes "is the greatest gaming achievement I have ever accomplished," Summoning Salt seems ready to hang up his virtual boxing gloves for good.</p>
<p>"I have no plans to ever improve this time," he writes. "It will be beaten by somebody one day, likely by matching this fight and then getting better luck in phase 3. I have no interest in competing for that but am extremely proud to have gotten the first sub 2 ever on Mike Tyson."</p>
