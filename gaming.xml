			<p>Grand Theft Auto V was released almost ten years ago on PC, but with some choice mods, the popular open-world title by Rockstar Games can look as mind-blowing as some of the best games released in the current console generation.</p>
<p>A new video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows the fifth entry in the series running with mods like <a href="https://www.razedmods.com/gta-v">NaturalVision Evolved</a> and <a href="https://gtareal.club/">GTA 5Real</a>, among others, at 8K resolution. At times, it's almost difficult to say this is Grand Theft Auto V and not a more recent, current-generation game.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K]  Mind-Blowing GTA 5 Photorealism Mods! (Next-Gen Graphics &amp; Maxed out settings)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWXuV9cWjsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the series by Rockstar Games will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V for a little while longer, as its highly-anticipated sequel will be released sometime next year. Given the game's ambition and scale, however, the release date could slip to 2026, although, as of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">it hasn't been delayed internally yet</a>. Its ambitious nature could also make it impossible for current generation consoles, including the soon-to-be-released PlayStation 5 Pro, to run it at<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/"> 60 frames per second</a>, forcing players who want to experience the new rendition of Vice City at high refresh rates to wait for the PC version, which has yet to be officially announced.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and Xbox 360.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-american-truck-simulator-dlc-state-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SCS Software has revealed the next&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC state, and if you're a fan of truckin' in the South, then this one's for you.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/4657376178538345385" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, the next major project for SCS Software is Louisiana. It follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/american-truck-simulator-nebraska-dlc-release-date">Nebraska</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/american-truck-simulator-montana-release-date-announced">Montana</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/scs-software-shows-off-american-truck-simulator-oklahoma-dlc-cities-and-more">Oklahoma</a> in the annals of cities that have been added to&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>via downloadable content.</p>
<p>This being an&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC pack, we don't have a release date for it yet, but we do have a bunch of mighty pretty screenshots to look at while we wait.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/american-truck-simulator-dlc-state-louisiana-road.jpg?itok=7nymcyUw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/american-truck-simulator-dlc-state-louisiana-road.jpg?itok=jOOMViDc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>American Truck Simulator</em>'s next DLC state has been revealed, and it looks just as beautiful as you'd expect.</figcaption></figure><p>SCS Software is promising the inclusion of iconic Louisiana cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge, as well as miles and miles of lowlands, valleys, and rolling hills.</p>
<p>Of course, you'll also find plenty of signature Louisiana geographical features; the Mississippi floodplain will be yours to explore, as will the river delta, which has "shaped how the area looks today", as the developer points out.</p>
<p>As you truck through Louisiana, you'll encounter lots of different industrial facilities, including agriculture, fishing, forestry, and petroleum. Don't worry; since New Orleans is one of the US' busiest ports, you'll have plenty of cargo to transport.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for the&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>Louisiana DLC right here.</p>

<p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll know that SCS Software typically takes its time with DLC for the game, so it could be a while before we hear about this one again.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the studio has promised to share more about the Louisiana DLC and what you can expect from it in future blog posts.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, which is also where you'll find up-to-the-minute information about the Louisiana DLC as and when SCS Software releases it.</p>

<p>Playground Productions has announced that five more Backyard Sports classic games are coming to Steam. The news comes on the day that the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/backyard-baseball-97-being-re-released-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backyard Baseball 97</a> also launched on Steam.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/backyardsports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coming to the storefront</a> are Backyard Soccer ‘98,&nbsp;Backyard Football ‘99, Backyard Basketball ‘01, Backyard Baseball ‘01&nbsp;and&nbsp;Backyard Hockey ‘02.</p>



<p>Release dates haven’t been announced for the games, but that information is expected to come soon. All of the games will be single-player only with Steam achievements.</p>



<p>In addition to the five other games coming to Steam, it was confirmed that Backyard Baseball 97 is verified for Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Playground Productions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/backyard-sports-returns-with-franchise-revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced the return</a> of the Backyard Sports series in August. The return is starting with re-releases and remasters of old titles. However, there is a belief that new games are on the horizon.</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly excited to reintroduce&nbsp;Backyard Sports&nbsp;to a new generation of players,” Playground Productions CPO Chris Waters said at the time. </p>



<p>“I can’t wait for fans to see what we’re building on the Playground.”</p>

                <p>The first internally developed video game from Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime's publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-founds-new-studio-dreamhaven/1100-6482533/" data-ref-id="1100-6482533">Dreamhaven</a> is Sunderfolk, a tactical, fantasy co-op RPG meant to be played in person, with players using their phone as their controller.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk comes from Dreamhaven's Secret Door studio, which is composed of numerous ex-Blizzard employees and includes studio head Chris Sigaty, who worked at Blizzard for over 20 years and served as a lead producer on games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-2650">Warcraft 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-30719">Starcraft 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBOhgqT3Q78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBOhgqT3Q78" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The board game table is something very special, and we wanted to create a video game that had those same elements," Sigaty said in Sunderfolk's announcement trailer. "We focused on this idea of collaborating together. We're using the phone in everyone's pocket as their control interface. Your phone being the controller allows you to have your own information as well as roll out only the information needed at any given time."</p><p dir="ltr">In Sunderfolk, players will step into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic animals and embark in an ongoing campaign meant to be played over multiple sessions, similar to a tabletop roleplaying game. Players will pick a class that they will use over the course of multiple sessions, along the way leveling up and gaining new abilities. In Sunderfolk's announcement trailer, we get a glimpse of a polar bear Berserker and an otter Rogue in action, as well as other classes like Bard, Arcanist, Ranger, and Pyromancer. The television displays the game's "board" and information relevant to each player, while a player's phone will display details about their character and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, Sunderfolk is divided into two parts. Players will embark on missions where they gather loot, battle enemies, solve puzzles, and complete objectives. After the mission, the group returns to town, where each player can go to different locations independently to improve their character, sell items, and talk to townsfolk.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u-2_fngUPg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8u-2_fngUPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Actress Anjali Bhimani, the voice of Symmetra in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch</a> and Rampart in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>, (and who has also made guest appearances on tabletop RPG shows like Dimension 20) can be heard as the narrator of Sunderfolk's debut gameplay trailer. Secret Door confirmed Bhimani will actually voice all of Sunderfolk's characters, with the intent, according to game director Erin Marek, being for her to be reminiscent of an in-person game master who does the voices for every character players encounter on their tabletop adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Marek said the goal of Sunderfolk is to create something that would mimic an in-person game night, bringing people together like they would in a roleplaying game like Dungeons and Dragons or a board game.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is really trying to parallel that experience of I've got a hand of cards and a board on the ground in front of us," Marek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk is also meant to serve as a gateway to bring friends and family members into the tabletop RPG space.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to give an entry point for folks already in the community to pull along their friends, their family, their loved ones, who want to be part of that community as well," Marek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk is slated to release in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, with more information about the game to be shared in the months ahead.</p>

		<p>Just over a week ago, Sports Interactive announced that Football Manager 25 would be released on November 26th. However, things have changed in the short time since that announcement, and Sports Interactive has now delayed the release of Football Manager 25 to March 2025, following discussions with Sega and other partners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement released today, Sports Interactive said, <em>“After careful consideration, Sports Interactive have made the tough decision to further delay the release of Football Manager 25. Following discussions with SEGA, our licensors and partners, we have agreed the best course of action is to delay the launch until March 2025. Specific platform release dates will follow once confirmed.</em></p>
<p><em>In our last&nbsp;<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0">Development Update in September</a>, we explained that we needed to push FM25’s original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first instalment in a new era of Football Manager. This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted – despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done. Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>FM25 is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November. Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>For the large numbers of you who have already pre-ordered the game, we thank you very much for your trust and support. Given the delay, however, should you wish to claim a refund, please contact your retailer. Something you noted as missing from our announcement on 30 September was mention of Advanced Access on PC/Mac. We can confirm Advanced Access will be available ahead of the new release date and, when we are confident on how long that period will be, we will update you at the first opportunity. The new gameplay reveal will also now move to the end of January 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you. We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry.&nbsp;Thank you for reading and your patience. It means the world to us as we continue to work on creating a new era for Football Manager.”</em></p>
<p>We do not know what impact this will have on the release schedule of future Football Manager games, as it is unlikely that Football Manager 26 will be ready by the end of 2025. The switch to a new engine and fundamental changes to the gameplay has already seen features stripped from Football Manager 25 including, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. Football Manager 25 will have the official Premier League license and women’s football for the first time in its history.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amber Isle Review - A Colossal Close Hit]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amber-isle-review-colossal-close-hit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amber-isle-review-a-colossal-close-hit.1006155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amber-isle-review-colossal-close-hit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who knew that the answer to ultimate relaxation was building a shop and rebuilding an island entirely made up of cute dinosaurs? <em>Amber Isle</em> lets you do just that, combining adorable aesthetics with island restoration that takes the edge off after a long day.</p>
<p><em>Amber Isle</em> is, at its core, a management game. Players fall in control of an island shop, where they soon learn that they can revive the island by being successful and breathing life into the abandoned areas. More dinosaurs can be invited to stay as areas are fixed up, and a touching story brings the island together by the end.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to love about <em>Amber Isle</em> – the shop simulation, dinosaur designs, and overall decorating were wonderful. However, there are bugs at every corner that slows things down, and not in a good way.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-story.jpg?itok=hgqkvyhl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-story.jpg?itok=1mp5E_it 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking control of the shop is the first part of the story in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Shop Simulation Done As Cozy As Possible</h2>
<p><em>Amber Isle</em> does a few things incredibly well, and the shop simulation aspect is one of them. Players mostly craft all the items they sell with materials gathered by cleaning up and exploring the island areas.</p>
<p>This crafting system was a lot simpler than in many other games. Gathering materials for each item was straightforward and easy to do. For those who aren’t a fan of complex crafting systems, like myself, this is a good thing. It’s much more relaxing and calm compared to other, similar games, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/cozy-grove-review"><em>Cozy Grove</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the shop itself was much more relaxing to run than other shop simulation games. Most of the time, dinos will buy the item outright or bring it up to the counter to haggle.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-haggling.jpg?itok=TDvrQtzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-haggling.jpg?itok=RqB4KcKc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em>, haggling is a way to either make friends or boost your shop's ranking -- choose wisely.</figcaption></figure><p>Haggling is what you make of it. By giving dinos the price they want, or at least a lower price than you’re asking, friendship with them is raised significantly. By trying to get a better deal for yourself, the shop’s level will rise more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When players aren’t haggling, they can clean the shop or turn on various appliances to raise the aesthetics of the shop (though this isn’t available until later on). Occasionally, a dino will break something that has to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only problem with the shop is that it can be buggy. There were several times when I was trying to accept a haggle price set by a dino and they would act like I was charging them much higher than they were asking. This led to several mad dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, trying to interact with the front counter can be difficult. The interact icon is hard to land perfectly on at times, especially if there’s any sort of furniture near the front counter, even in areas that you wouldn’t expect to impact you. I ended up just not using the entire wall that the counter is closest to as a way to avoid the worst of the problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found ways around these problems, but it was a bit annoying to do so consistently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isla-kai.jpg?itok=j2qbvB5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isla-kai.jpg?itok=rZPkvn2R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dinos in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>are unique and lovable with distinct personalities.</figcaption></figure><h2>Dino Designs Take the Stage in Amber Isle</h2>
<p>The dinosaurs in <em>Amber Isle</em> had distinct personalities and stories. I was impressed by this level of detail, with some dinos being related to each other and others having development as the story progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting to know these dinos is a key part of <em>Amber Isle</em>. It’s also really well incorporated into the story. While they are all side quests, players will inevitably complete them as they progress. This kept <em>Amber Isle</em> fresh and cohesive on top of the great characters.</p>
<p>Plus, the dinosaur designs were incredibly fun. While creating your own character is its own adventure, meeting the other dinosaurs was part of the fun. Their designs matched their personalities well, even down to the tiniest details.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-character-creator.jpg?itok=uUffY8HO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-character-creator.jpg?itok=IcCzm_wC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even the character creator in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>is incredibly detailed.</figcaption></figure><h2>Decorating and Reviving Amber Isle is Free and Fun</h2>
<p>Recruiting these adorable dinos means making the areas around <em>Amber Isle</em> as attractive as possible. Decorating and redesigning these areas is vital, and it feels less like a chore and more like an honor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designing is simple and intuitive, and it just costs money to do (which is a much less complex system than having to craft every individual item). The decorations themselves are cute, and it’s satisfying to walk around and see what you’ve created. There are so many ways to really tailor each area and make it exactly what you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, this became the highlight of my playthrough. I had a lot of fun creating little areas. Designing can sometimes feel overwhelming or pointless, even for the most style-savvy players. However, its purpose and the ease of decorating make the feature a highlight instead of something stressful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baths-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=81Co7BC6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baths-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=uFNLGPqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The areas around&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>were just as distinct and full of possibility as the game itself.</figcaption></figure><h2>Paleo Problems Abound</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there were several problems in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em> that can make the game feel frustrating. For example, there were consistently spaces in my inventory or in the shop that I couldn’t interact with. So if I needed to choose a specific item to move or to give to a customer, I literally couldn’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, I could get around this by automatically sorting my bag. This would force items to move and hopefully land somewhere I could interact. The problematic spots were different every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I struggled to find dinos sometimes. They’d show on the overworld map but be hidden by an object. In particular, one small dinosaur was almost always stuck under a pile of dirt and impossible to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smaller problems, such as a lack of explanation about how to use several systems in the game and UI issues, brought <em>Amber Isle</em>&nbsp;down quite a bit. Some players may be less bothered by these, but it’s enough to make the game confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A note on the game's Discord did explain that the build I had been playing was old, and it had been updated and was available to check out. This was after the review was written, and after checking the new build out, there were still several problems. Some bugs had been fixed while others still made it into the game, and new bugs cropped up that I'd never experienced before.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/audi-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=VxbZyOe- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/audi-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=mwluO1EE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>OrbCorp, the main antagonist in <em>Amber Isle</em>, is just as big a problem as the bugs.</figcaption></figure><h2>Overall, Amber Isle Falls Just Short</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, these problems make it so that <em>Amber Isle</em> struggles to feel like a good, solid game. It has several amazing components, but the bugs and issues are so abundant that it’s frustrating at best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for players who don’t mind navigating around bugs for cute, relaxing dinosaur fun, <em>Amber Isle</em> is a solid pick.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-delayed-to-next-year-after-difficult-development-cycle.1006152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>delay, with the management sim now due to launch for PC and consoles in March next year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post explaining the delay</a>, Sports Interactive says that the additional development time it afforded itself back in September "has not been sufficient" to ensure the game "meets your expectations and our very high standards".</p>
<p>The studio puts the delay down to a "difficult development cycle", with many parts of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>'s creation "moving slower than we had predicted", although the dev says that's not the team's fault.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-delayed-player-screen.jpg?itok=uZXvm0-d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-delayed-player-screen.jpg?itok=nz4OyoAp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>won't be arriving until March next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Sports Interactive goes on to say that the timeline for&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>'s development was "already tight", and that the developer was "simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards".</p>
<p>The studio concludes that it's too risky to rush&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>to release in November, and so the game will now be launching in March instead. Advanced Access will still be available ahead of the new release date.</p>
<p>This delay announcement is pretty noteworthy given that the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date">only announced last week</a>, raising questions about how a game can be delayed less than two weeks after its release date was revealed.</p>
<p>Judging by some of the replies on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager</em>'s official X (formerly Twitter) account, fans aren't happy with the delay, either. Many suggest that the release of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is now effectively irrelevant, given that it will launch just two months or so before the end of the season.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series of football (sorry, I'm British, so it's not "soccer" to me) management sims.</p>
<p>The game will feature a number of improvements over&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24</em>, including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">license for the English Premier League</a> for the first time in series history, although it will also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">lack Create-a-Club and other core series features</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know when the new&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date is, but the game will be arriving some time in March next year. Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>&nbsp;or check it out on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010715" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/football-manager-25-console/9NQ4K2ZW5HJV/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Store</a> if you wish.</p>

Codenamed Arrow Lake S, these are also Intel’s first enthusiast desktop CPUs with a built-in NPU, or a neural processing unit, for accelerating AI tasks.</p><p>“Arrow Lake will deliver Intel’s best performance for enthusiasts in desktop and mobile,” says Josh Newman, general manager and VP of product marketing client computing.&nbsp;“It will deliver that performance at significantly lower power levels than previous generations of Intel enthusiast products, and Arrow Lake is also delivering the first Intel AI PC for enthusiasts in both the desktop and mobile performance space.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The full Core Ultra 200S lineup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>At the heart of the Arrow Lake architecture is a big effort from Intel to reduce the power draw from its chips. Both the 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core CPU generations were power-hungry, often drawing far much more power than their AMD equivalents. These new Core Ultra 200S series chips will halve the power consumption when you’re doing basic desktop tasks, and Intel claims they’ll shave off lots of watts during gaming, too.</p><p>“You’ll see about half the power consumption at the desktop,” says Robert Hallock, vice president of client computing group at Intel. “You’ll also see about half the power when you’re just using a single core. Gaming it’s going to be up or down, 50 to 150 watts just depends on the title and its behavior.”</p><p>During a recent press briefing, Intel demonstrated <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> running on its flagship Core Ultra 9 285K compared to its current Core i9-14900K. The Ultra 9 285K delivered similar or better performance at 80 watts less in <em>Mirage</em>, and Intel claims it will reduce power by up to 58 watts in games like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em>, <em>F1 24</em>, and <em>Total War: Pharaoh</em>. There are some extreme cases like <em>Warhammer: Space Marines 2</em> where the Ultra 9 285K even runs at 165 watts less than the 14900K. </p><div><figcaption><em>Intel’s power claims for the Core Ultra 9 285K.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>Intel also claims the package temperatures of the Core Ultra 9 285K will drop by around 13C compared to the 14900K during gaming at 1080p with a 360mm all-in-one cooler. While Intel is moving to its new LGA-1851 socket with these new chips, existing all-in-one coolers should work just fine. You may need to speak to your cooler manufacturer to confirm whether you need additional standoffs, but Corsair confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that all of its coolers that supported LGA-1700 also support LGA-1851.</p><p>Intel is using its latest 3D packaging technology to build the Core Ultra 200S series chips, and the package size has been reduced by 33 percent over the 14th Gen chips. There are some interesting changes as a result of this new package. The flagship Ultra 9 285K will ship with 24 cores, 24 threads, and a boost clock of 5.7GHz. That’s a slower boost clock and eight fewer threads than the previous 14900K, as Intel has removed hyperthreading in favor of power efficiency here. “We knew we could save the wattage for hyperthreading by not including it,” says Hallock.</p><p>The Ultra 9 285K will have eight performance cores (P-cores) and 16 efficiency ones (E-cores). The E-cores have been upgraded with more efficiency to process instructions, and there’s even a reduction in latency. There will be 36MB L3 shared smart cache, 3MB of L2 per P-core (up from 2MB on 14th Gen), and 4MB of L2 per E-core.&nbsp;Intel is claiming that the Ultra 9 285K will be around 8 percent faster in single-thread tasks compared to the 14900K and around 15 percent faster on multi-threaded workloads.</p><div><figcaption><em>Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285K will trade blows with AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X in gaming.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>Intel has also provided some limited benchmarks for gaming with the Ultra 9 285K up against AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 7950X3D processors. It looks like Intel’s latest flagship will be trading blows with AMD’s flagship Zen 5 desktop CPU, but on the X3D side, it’s clear from Intel’s own data that it will be behind. Intel is also being surprisingly transparent about being behind the best gaming CPU right now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D</a>.</p><p>“I think we’ll be about five percent back versus X3D parts, which we feel really good about considering we have just the cache that’s built into the CPU and the great IPC of the product,” says Hallock. “You’ll see about a five percent deficit and I want to be clear about that.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Intel is being clear the Core Ultra 9 285K will lose out to AMD’s X3D chips in gaming performance.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>That’s disappointing for the gaming side of things, but Intel claims it will still hold the performance crown for most creator and AI tasks. It has even added an NPU to the Ultra 9 285K, which will be able to accelerate certain AI tasks. It’s only capable of 13 TOPS, meaning these processors won’t qualify for Microsoft’s Copilot Plus features that require a 40 TOPS or better NPU. Intel is hoping that as NPU adoption grows, developers will be able to leverage this to offload tasks and even for some gaming-related features.</p><p>“It was fully possible to put a 40 TOPS NPU on this product, but to do so would require shrinking core count or changing GPU core count,” admits Hallock. “You start making sacrifices in fundamental performance dimensions that enthusiasts really do care about. That didn’t feel like the right mix. We also talked at length about the enthusiast market’s disposition on AI as a whole, and I think it’s fair to say it’s somewhat reluctant.”</p><p>A new LGA-1851 socket also means new motherboards. You’ll need a new Z890 board to use the Core Ultra 200S desktop CPUs. Intel’s 800 series chipset supports up to 24 PCIe 4.0 lanes, up to 8x SATA 3.0, and up to 32 USB 3.2 ports. The platform supports a total of 48 PCIe lanes, with up to 20 of those being Gen 5 from the CPU. There’s also integrated Wi-Fi 6E and 1GbE, Bluetooth 5.3, and 2x Thunderbolt 4 on the CPU, with motherboard makers able to add discrete options for Wi-Fi 7, up to 4x Thunderbolt 5 ports, 2.5GbE, and Bluetooth 5.4.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new 800 series chipset provides plenty of PCIe and USB connectivity.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>Intel is also improving memory support with the Core Ultra 200S series and Z890 motherboards, supporting up to DDR5-6400, up to 48GB per DIMM, and up to 192GB max capacity. DDR4 support has been dropped for the 800 series chipset. These chips are also Secure Core compliant and include three built-in hardware engines for security.</p><p>It’s not clear how long the LGA-1851 socket will last, though. AMD has committed to supporting AM5 to 2027 or beyond, but Intel is refusing to comment on future product plans. With rumors of an Arrow Lake S refresh being canceled in favor of a leap to Nova Lake, it’s possible the LGA-1851 socket won’t be around for long. Intel launched its LGA-1200 socket in 2020, before replacing it with the LGA-1700 a year later, so hopefully history won’t repeat itself again.</p><p>The Arrow Lake reveal comes just days after Intel said its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262287/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-root-cause-fix">Raptor Lake crashing nightmare</a> is finally over. Instability issues with 13th and 14th Gen chips have now been addressed, with a too-high voltage issue as the root cause. Intel’s new Arrow Lake chips won’t be impacted by the Raptor Lake voltage problems.</p><p>Intel’s new Core Ultra 200S chips will start shipping on October 24th, with the flagship $589 Core Ultra 9 285K, a $394 Core Ultra 7 265K, and the $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. Intel is also launching KF variants of the Ultra 7 265KF ($379) and Ultra 5 245KF ($294) without the built-in GPU.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Intel have announced their latest batch of desktop CPUs, the Core Ultra 200S series, and it's got the component giants singing quite a different tune. Instead of trying to stuff in ever more threads, and ever more PC-incinerating clock speeds, the Core Ultra 200S family – spearheaded by the Core Ultra 9 285K when it launches later this year – will dial back certain specs compared the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-core-i5-14600k-and-core-i9-14900k-review">14th Gen</a> range. Instead, the focus will be on power efficiency and lowering temperatures.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That’s not to say this generation will actively trundle backwards on performance. Intel claim that the Core Ultra 200S’ new P-core and E-core designs have improved IPC (instructions per clock, or basically how much work the core can perform in each clock cycle) by 9% and 32% respectively. And the Core Ultra 9 285K, which replaces the Core i9-14900K, is said to be a in "dead heat" with AMD’s top-spec Ryzen 9 9950X when averaging out all their gaming benchmark differences.</p>
<p>However, this new chip also cuts its thread count to 24 (matching its physical core count but down on the i9-14900K’s 24 core/32 thread setup), while also stepping away from the i9-14900K’s maximum 6GHz clock speed to top out at 5.7GHz instead. It’s a similar story down the rest of the range, too: the Core 5 245K, successor to the more mainstream Core i5-14600K, drops from 20 threads to 14, and from a 5.3GHz max clock speed to 5.2GHz.</p>

<p>A concession that infinite growth is futile, and that gaming CPUs, like their owners, will ultimately decay into insignificant cosmic dust? Not quite. It’s all in aid of better efficiency, y’see, and the Core Ultra 200S range is very much designed to be Intel’s least power-hungry chip generation in years, with total package power down by 40% in some cases. And while it might not get far better framerates out of your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a> than the 14th Gen crew, if it can at least avoid running slower, that could work out to a tremendous improvement in performance-per-watt.</p><p>During a pre-reveal presentation, Intel showed off two PCs running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> – both identical, save for one using a Core Ultra 9 285K and the other a Core i9-14900K. The former was pulling about 80W less than the latter, which is an awful lot of juice to save from a single component switch. And while we weren’t shown these tests in action, other games could benefit as much or more: supposedly, the power draw difference between these two CPUs is around 34W in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, 79W in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a>, and 169W (!) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, all in the newer model's favour. Gulping down fewer watts should also help these chips beat the heat; Intel say that they run 13°c cooler, on average, than the equivalent 14th Gen chips.</p>
<p>I’m keen not get <em>too</em> credulous toward the official numbers, following a torrid year for Intel that started with the underwhelming 14th Gen launch and was marred further by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-algorithm-among-the-many-other-things-they-ruin-is-causing-stability-problems-on-intel-core-cpus">serious stability defect</a> on both those chips and the 13th Gen range; the Core Ultra 200S series apparently is and always has been unaffected. At the very least, the blue team opting not to go all-cores-blazing on performance, when AMD’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-worlds-fastest-gaming-cpu-amds-ryzen-7-5800x3d-gets-a-price-and-release-date">3D V-Cache</a> processors have claimed the 'best for games' crown, could be seen as just a different kind of risky.</p>

<p>And yet, I do kinda see the point. For one thing, simply iterating on speeds hasn’t worked out for Intel; after all the innovation of the 12th Gen Alder Lake series, the two following generations didn’t try anything near as ambitious, resulting in three years’ worth of CPUs that all broadly performed the same. Clearly a change in design thinking was necessary. As was a rethink of Core power draws, especially for the Core i9 variants, which have recently been far too nonplussed about hitting 100°c under load. A 13°c reduction here could literally save your processor's life.</p><p>Even if Core Ultra 200S doesn’t outmuscle the 3D V-Cache crew, then, it’s still a major course correction. And could still find an appreciative audience, whether they simply want to keep their electricity costs down, or have become more sensitive and aware of the environmental impact of their playing habits. Or, if nothing else, a few dozen watts saved on the CPU would allow for a beefier graphics card upgrade without needing to change PSUs.</p>
<p>A new motherboard will be in order, though, as well as a new cooler mounting kit, as the Core Ultra 200S is only compatible with the also-new LGA1851 socket. Now <em>there's</em> the Intel I know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re enough to justify this brotherly reunion entirely.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-charms-its-way-through-familial-familiarity&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-charms-its-way-through-familial-familiarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Phillips at <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> thought the game was similarly pleasing despite the familiar formula and repetitive battles thanks in large part to all the little touches and quirky characters that fill out its world. “Seeing the brothers turn into a spaceship, getting caught out by a tricksy enemy’s attack pattern in combat, going on a quest to recover hair wax for a faded Concordian pop star—I found plenty in <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> that raised a smile,” he writes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/463951/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/463951/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael McWhertor at<em> Polygon</em></a></span><em> </em>lauded some of the new ideas in the game even though if he found the hands-on demo a bit more uneven. “The most enticing aspects of it are the depth of combat, a branching narrative, and a cast of colorful electrical outlet-themed characters,” he writes. “I have some reservations about how it plays—the game’s performance was a little chunky and battles didn’t feel as snappy as past handheld <em>Mario &amp; Luigis</em> did—but I’m still excited about a new entry in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> franchise nonetheless.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-aims-to-emerge-from-paper-marios-shadow/1100-6527047/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-aims-to-emerge-from-paper-marios-shadow/1100-6527047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Watts at <em>GameSpot</em></a></span> had a more specific criticism that I could see being unnecessarily frustrating without an option to swap controls in the settings. “I was, however, slightly disoriented by the way the menu confirmation works,” he writes. “Mario’s button prompts are always mapped to A and Luigi’s are always mapped to B, as usual for the series. But when selecting an attack from the menu, A is confirm and B is cancel regardless of which brother you’re selecting. That means remembering that when choosing a Mario attack, you use A to confirm and then A to perform the timing prompts, but when choosing a Luigi attack, you use A to confirm and then immediately switch to B for the timing prompts. I’m sure it would come to me with practice, but during the short preview session, I got my wires crossed and flubbed the timing on more than one occasion.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-the-final-preview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-the-final-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leanne Butkovic at <em>IGN</em></a></span> was cautious about making any grand pronouncements based on the limited demo time, but came away hopeful the newest <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>has enough gas in the tank for its entire adventure. “There’s a chance that <em>Brothership</em> fizzles out as the story chugs along, or that using Battle Plugs becomes rote,” she writes. “But, given that so many other facets of the gameplay immediately struck me as so well thought-out, I’m holding out hope that the franchise has learned plenty of lessons over the course of five games and two remakes to create something that feels fresh and whole.”</p><p>  <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is one of the last chances for the Switch to go out with a bang, although people have been predicting that for years even as Nintendo keeps stretching out the life of its handheld hybrid to be the longest in its console-making history. At the very least it seems destined to be a joy-sparking crowd-pleaser heading into the end of the year. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-intel-core-ultra-200s-series-cpu-features">Intel Core Ultra 200S Series CPU Features</h2>



<p>According to Intel, the Core Ultra 200S series has more than two times the graphical performance and over 10% more multithread performance while using less power.</p>



<p>“The overarching goal of this program was to make dramatic improvements in energy efficiency,” Robert Hallock, VP of client computing group and GM of AI technical marketing, said.</p>



<p>The Arrow Lake CPUs, according to Intel, cuts power consumption in general productivity by up to 58% in some instances compared to the last-generation Raptor Lake. That power consumption drop still comes with a slight increase in overall performance.</p>



<p>For gaming, Arrow Lake sees drops of up to 165W in total system power compared to last gen. Games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and F1 24 both saw drops over 50W. Assassin’s Creed Mirage had a near 80W power drop. Along with the power drop comes cooler performance. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Using the Core Ultra 9 285K as the benchmark, Intel said that temperatures fell while gaming by as much as 17°C.  </p>



<p>For general gaming performance, the new CPUs run mostly on par with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X. A few games like Total War: Warhammer 3 and Age of Mythology Retold perform better on the  Core Ultra 200S. However, games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2, per Intel itself, seem to perform slightly worse.</p>



<p>It’s not just for gaming, either. When comparing against the 9950X, the Core Ultra 285K showed improvement in various rendering processes almost across the board. According to Intel’s data, it lagged behind slighting in CPU-only rendering in Blender, photo edition, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Lightroom Classic.</p>



<p>With this new CPU generation, Intel is introducing its new 800 Series chipset. This new chipset comes with 48x PCIe lanes and 20x PCIe 5.0 lates. It has integrated support for Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and Thunderbolt 4. Discretely, it supports Wi-Fi 7, Thunderbolt 5, and Bluetooth 5.4. There is also support for Thunderbolt Share that allows quick file sharing along with PC to PC screen sharing and even storage sharing.</p>



<p>Three of the launch SKUs will also have integrated graphics. The Core Ultra 9 285K, Ultra 7 265K, and Ultra 5 245K all feature 4 GPU cores. The 285K and 265K will have a 2 GHz max frequency while the 245K has a 1.9 GHz max frequency. </p>



<p>Regarding memory, the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series supports up to DDR5-6400 MT/s with a max capacity of up to 192GB at a max of 48GB per DIMM.</p>



<h2 id="h-intel-is-coming-for-ai-pcs">Intel Is Coming For AI PCs</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>AI is the buzzword with PCs right now, and the Intel Core Ultra 200S series seems to be no different. The new family of processors is being touted as Intel’s “first ever AI PC for enthusiasts” thanks to its first-ever integrated NPU for AI.</p>



<p>The new Arrow Lake family of CPUs, Intel says, features up to 36 platform TOPS (Tera Operations per Second) thanks to its NPU delivering up to 13 TOPS on its own.  The NPU will allow larger-scale tasks to be performed parallel with one another, including generating video effects, audio, and even gaming. An example Intel used in its briefing on the AI abilities of the new processors was NPU-enabled auto framing and background segmentation. Intel says offloading tasks to the NPU will “free up the GPU to focus on delivering higher game frame rates.” They add that offloading various tasks can “win back up to 15%” of frame rates in games.</p>



<p>To add more ways to utilize the NPU, Intel says its working with over 100 ISVs (independent software vendors) to bring over 300 AI-based features to users. They also say that there are more than 500 different AI models supported, including object detection, language processing, instance segmentation, and more. </p>



<p>In terms of overall performance, Intel says that the Core Ultra 200S processors have up to 50% faster AI performance than AMD. Specifically, the 50% increase was using Scene Edit Detection in After Effects. Most improvements were between 15%-20%, however.</p>



<p>In addition to the Core Ultra 200S series, Intel did confirm that details on its next-gen Core Ultra H and HX Series processors for mobile will be coming in the first quarter of 2025. More details on those will come at a later date.</p>

<p>Football Manager 25 has been delayed yet again. Developer <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sports Interactive has announced</a> that Football Manager 25 has been delayed until March 2025.</p>



<p>The decision comes after talks with SEGA, the studio’s licensors and partners.</p>



<p>Back in September, it was revealed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be pushed to November</a> with a few additional features being removed. The short push, however, wasn’t enough for Sports Interactive to get the game in a state they are happy with.</p>



<p>“This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards,” the studio said. </p>



<p>They continued: “Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.”</p>



<p>Football Manager 25 marks a shift for the series as it moves the game off the internal Sports Interactive Operating System (SIOS) and onto the Unity Engine. This has provided challenges for the team with it being “biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation.”</p>



<p>“We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November,” they said.</p>



<p>“Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.”</p>



<p>Though the game is now scheduled for March 2025, a specific release date wasn’t revealed. That will come at a later time along with details on advanced access for players.</p>



<p>What do you think of Football Manager 25 being delayed until March 2025. Let us know in the comments and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/893/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official community forums</a>.</p>

The statement continued, "In our last Development Update in September, we explained that we needed to push FM25's original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first installment in a new era of Football Manager. This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Football Manager (@FootballManager) <a href="https://twitter.com/FootballManager/status/1844377892303798752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The statement goes on to explain that it has been a "difficult development cycle" for Sports Interactive, and that things have been "moving slower than we had predicted." This led to concerns that the development team was "simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards." </p><p>The studio claims that this is the "biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation" and a "crucial juncture in Football Manager's history," making the delay unavoidable. Sega and Sports Interactive thanked fans who pre-ordered for their trust but also invited them to contact their retailer if they want a refund. The studio also said that early access will be available ahead of the new release date. A full gameplay reveal is expected to take place at the end of January.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you.

We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry," the statement said. </p><p>It's a huge move for Football Manager, which is customarily released each November. The highly-regarded sim is a fixture for football fans, who log hundreds or even thousands of hours managing clubs ranging from superpowers like Manchester City to minnows like Notts County. It's known for its intimidating level of depth and the <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-unreal-genius-of-football-manager-greatest-video-g-5707443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fascinating stories that can come out of it</a>. It's so popular that it has resulted in fans from locales like China traveling halfway around the world to see tiny English clubs like the <a href="https://deadspin.com/soccer-fan-travels-halfway-around-the-world-to-visit-ti-1819658631/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Runcorn Linnets</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Football Manager 25 looks to be a massive update for the annual franchise. In addition to featuring fully-licensed Premier League teams, it will add women's football to create "one world, one ecosystem." Sega claims this year's version will have "more playable leagues and nations than ever," and that it will feature major technical and visual improvements as it switches to Unity. All of these features represent a major step forward for the franchise, which is known for being fairly conservative with its updates.</p><p>When Football Manager 25 does come out, it will be available on PS5, PC, and Xbox, where it will once again be available on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been almost 10 years since two very iconic plumber brothers were accidentally sucked into a new world for a brand-new adventure together, so it’s about time that Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership threw a fat wrench into their idyllic lives romping around the Mushroom Kingdom. In this RPG, it’s not Princess Peach who needs saving; it’s an entire archipelago that’s been cut off from its source of power, and it’s up to the bros to reconnect the flow of energy and commerce among the vast network of islands in the land of Concordia.</p><p>In a little more than an hour, I got to play through the main missions on two particular early-game islands, Twistee and Merrygo. While it definitely felt like these were building the groundwork for bigger challenges and more intricate gameplay to come, the slice of island-hopping upon the brothers’ mammoth seafaring vessel, the ship-slash-island Shipshape Island, that I did experience hinted at the larger potential of what’s to come.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – 34 New Screenshots From June 2024's Nintendo Direct</h3></div></output><p>It might go without saying, but for starters, I thought Brothership was totally charming. Ignoring the fact that water and electricity is a dangerous matchup, Brothership’s staunch loyalty to its voltaic motif was clearly extremely carefully considered, from the more obvious socket-faced NPCs and the bros’ cute navigator Snoutlet to the tinier flourishes that I caught when I looked more closely, like the jumper-cable design of an enemy Snaptor bird. The attention to detail extends all the way down to Mario and Luigi’s downright hammy reaction animations, like making huge “no” gestures during conversations, doing hype dances for each other when they level up, and beefing their landings after being shot out of Shipshape’s cannon. Those were honestly some of my favorite small moments that highlight Brothership’s giddy sense of humor that feels cozy yet refreshing, especially when it’s enjoyed from a TV screen instead of a handheld console. (Apologies to the Switch Liters.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The attention to detail extends all the way down to Mario and Luigi’s downright hammy reaction animations, like making huge “no” gestures during conversations, doing hype dances for each other when they level up, and beefing their landings after being shot out of Shipshape’s cannon.</p></div><p>Even the premise itself feels like an exercise in kindness and community-building. The goal of reconnecting isolated bubbles to rebuild a society that thrives when more plug-faced people are in it feels relevantly sentimental in 2024. On a more practical level, that simply means more of Brothership becomes available as more islands are linked. Additional socket-people take up residence on Shipshape and other islands, opening up the main storyline, side quests, and the capabilities of the ship. I really only got a glimpse of this on Twistee and Merrygo – I helped reunite a young poetess with her mother, escorted a shopkeeper through a bug-ridden field, made friends with a local groovemaster in need of hair wax, and cut a mutually beneficial deal with an engineer to find Peach lost in a maze – but as a sucker for silly personality-driven adventures, it had me very eager to dig in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the nice things about sailing to destinations aboard Shipshape is the ability to set a course while being able to run little errands as the boat traverses the Concordian sea. (If you choose the option to Fast Travel, Toad will work really, really hard.) Even if it’s functionally not all that different from a cut-to-black location transition, it does at least give the illusion that I’m being productive en route to whatever area of the sea I would want to visit next, which gives a seamless sense of exploration.</p><p>I should clarify that Brothership isn’t running purely on vibes. Like any RPG worth its salt, Mario and Luigi are regularly leveling up their stats and acquiring new weapon and equipment upgrades to take on bigger and badder enemies. Returning players will definitely notice some familiar elements of the turn-based combat system, especially in the shell-based Bros. Attacks. New ones will have an easy enough time picking it up, even if learning battle patterns and nailing the guys’ coordinated attack button presses might take some trial and error.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A brand-new addition to the battle system is something called Battle Plugs, which is acquired sometime before Merrygo Island. These are basically craftable advantages, augmentations, and buffs that are usually triggered when certain conditions are met, like netting additional damage upon landing ‘Excellent’ hits or auto-healing when health is running low. I had two slots to work with to try and discover the ideal combinations for surefire battle strategies. Picking among the plugs was a little time consuming, but this struck me as a feature that would naturally become a breeze in the course of developing a repertoire against enemies’ strengths and weaknesses during a regular playthrough.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battle Plugs are basically craftable advantages, augmentations, and buffs that are usually triggered when certain conditions are met.</p></div><p>I would have really loved to have gotten more hands-on time with the evolution of Luigi being struck by ingenuity – in Brothership, it’s called Luigi Logic. I only saw a few meaningful iterations of this, one of which turned the brothers into a UFO-shaped object to get them across a wide gap after some ballroom dance spins. The rest were simpler, mostly sending Luigi off to smash boxes or collect items that I didn’t feel like doing, which was nice. But given the kind of wild stuff Luigi dreamed up in Dream Team, I can only imagine what kinds of epiphanies he’ll have this time around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, there’s a chance that Brothership fizzles out as the story chugs along, or that using Battle Plugs becomes rote. But, given that so many other facets of the gameplay immediately struck me as so well thought-out, I’m holding out hope that the franchise has learned plenty of lessons over the course of five games and two remakes to create something that feels fresh and whole.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Metaphor ReFantazio arrives from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review">the creators of Persona 3, 4, and 5</a> on October 11 as a fantasy RPG with themes of royal families and knights and so on. To celebrate, publisher Sega is hosting a competition that gives one fan a royal title of their own.</p><p>"Sega has created a new and never to be repeated noble title: Hand to the Sovereign Prince of Sealand," it boasted.</p><p>The Principality of Sealand is a sea fort turned country off the coast of England with a population of one. Not one million or 100,000 thousand, but one. Originally built during World War 2, the decommissioned fort was occupied in 1967 by Paddy Roy Bates after he claimed it from a group of pirate radio broadcasters to begin a pirate radio himself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/metaphor-refantazio-x-sealand-17-1728563785384.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Prince Liam Bates of Sealand and Sealand. Image credit: Sega.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Bates declared the fort, which is basically just a platform in the middle of the sea, an independent nation. He occupied it until his death in 2012, and since then Sealand has been occupied by either Roy's family or their associates.</p><p>Though not recognised by any world government, Sealand claims it has been recognised by the UK via a court ruling and by Germany, which sent a diplomat to it. At the very least, it has a Guinness World Record as "the smallest area to lay claim to nation status."</p><p>It is this country's royal family that Sega is offering a Metaphor ReFantazio fan a position in. The winner will become Hand to the Sovereign Prince of Sealand. The prince is otherwise known as Liam Bates, and he doesn't actually live there.</p><p>"When my grandfather founded Sealand in the 1960s, one of his first actions was to bestow the title of Princess Joan on my grandmother," Bates said. "In the more than five decades since, we’ve established several noble titles, but never a Hand to the Prince.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sega has created a new and never to be repeated noble title: Hand to the Sovereign Prince of Sealand.</p></div><p>"We’ve achieved a lot as the world’s smallest nation but this partnership with Sega and Atlus to create a one off title marks our first foray into the world of video games, and it’s a venture future Sealand royals will look back on with pride."</p><p>The prize includes more than just the official title, however. Winners will also get a taxi paid to their nearest train station, two return train tickets (but not first class) to Harwich, a two night stay in a Harwich hotel (room service not included), and a speedboat trip out to Sealand. The trip isn't available on Valentine’s Day, Christmas, New Year’s Eve, Easter, or bank holidays.</p><p>Once at Sealand, the lucky winner will have the title bestowed on them with an authentic registration deed from the government of Sealand.</p><p>To enter, fans must follow Sega and Atlus West on X/Twitter or Instagram and create a short video explaining why they deserve to be the Hand to the Sovereign Prince of Sealand. "All entries with music in the background will not be accepted," Sega assured.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/metaphor-refantazio-x-sealand-11-1728563920423.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Prince Liam Bates of Sealand with Metaphor ReFantazio. Image credit: Sega.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Metaphor ReFantazio puts players "in The United Kingdom of Euchronia, where the assassination of the king brings chaos and unrest to the land," per its story synopsis. "Then, one fateful day, a magic known only to the king called the Royal Magic is invoked, and the world becomes embroiled in a royal tournament for the throne.</p><p>"In the midst of this, the protagonist, together with his partner, the fairy Gallica, must find a way to break the curse that has been placed on the prince that the kingdom believes to be dead. To do so, they depart on a journey across the vast land."</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-prologue-demo-arrives-today-on-xbox-playstation-and-pc">A demo is currently availably on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC</a>, giving players a taste of the RPG before they buy it proper. It includes the first four dungeons; the ability to unlock seven of the more than 40 classes, called Archetypes; an introduction to six followers including party members that supports the player; and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">In our 9/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Refining the Atlus RPG formula of weaving tough turn-based combat into compelling social sim mechanics, Metaphor: ReFantazio doesn’t just send a powerful message across its political drama, it becomes a beautiful expression of the real impact storytelling can have on all of us."</p><p><em>Image Credit: Sega</em></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nintendo is weird and I absolutely love it for that. In addition to releasing generation-defining games like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Odyssey, the company isn’t afraid to take wild turns and release hardware no one could have ever predicted beforehand. </p><p>The latest of these out-of-left-field products is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-switch-2-nintendo-just-released-a-100-interactive-alarm-clock-called-alarmo"><u>Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo</u></a>, the $100 alarm clock Nintendo revealed this week that will wake you up with sounds and songs from Breath of the Wild, Odyssey, Splatoon 3, Ring Fit Adventure, and Pikmin 4. It’s not the hardware reveal we’ve been waiting for (even if <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-has-a-fascinating-connection-to-late-nintendo-president-satoru-iwata"><u>Nintendo did hint at Alarmo as long as 10 years ago</u></a>) but it’s certainly a fun addition that maintains Nintendo’s reputation as the video game industry’s crazy toymaker.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Alarmo reveal inspired us to compile a list of some of the other weirdest devices, gizmos, and gadgets Nintendo has put out over the years. It’s worth noting, we’re only highlighting products that actually came out – so you won’t find the Wii’s vitality sensor here. And, this list only includes hardware that’s directly related to Nintendo’s video game business, so we’re not discussing its history with playing cards and love hotels. Finally, we’re only counting products Nintendo developed internally, which eliminates officially licensed accessories like the infamous Power Glove. With all that said, let’s dive into some (but <em>definitely</em> not all) of the weirdest releases in Nintendo history.</p><h3><strong>Virtual Boy</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/virtual-boy-1728556809262.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo tried to release a virtual reality headset decades before the technology was ready for it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-virtual-boy-nintendos-most-famous-failure"><u>The Virtual Boy launched in 1995</u></a> and is far and away the biggest flop in Nintendo history, failing to cross one million units sold in its lifetime. Its infamous red and black display is known for inducing painful headaches after just minutes of playing, and the console saw just 22 games before Nintendo stopped supporting it. I’ve never had the privilege of playing Virtual Boy myself, but I hear the Virtual Boy Wario Land game is actually pretty fantastic. Nintendo is <a href="https://jp.ign.com/nintendo/76625/interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>using a Switch to emulate Virtual Boy games</u></a> at its new museum in Kyoto, Japan, so maybe someday we’ll see a virtual console library for the Virtual Boy on Nintendo Switch Online.</p><h3>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/rob-the-robot-nes-1728560996798.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Long before we had AI teammates who supported us on the battlefield, Nintendo created an <em>actual</em> buddy who you could play games with. Back in 1985, the Robotic Operating Buddy – or R.O.B. as he was affectionally known – released for the NES and was effectively player two in a game. But as great as that sounds, R.O.B. only worked with two games – Gyromite and Stack-Up – and unfortunately the tech didn’t match the ambition; it was tricky to set up properly and, according to Nintendo execs at the time, R.O.B. moved so slowly it was like “watching grass grow”. It was quietly discontinued a couple of years later but R.O.B. still lives on as a character in Smash Bros.</p><h3><strong>Game Boy Camera / Printer</strong></h3><p>Before we all had high resolution cameras in our pockets at all times, Nintendo took a shot at creating a portable camera with the Game Boy Camera. This accessory plugged into the Game Boy (and its various hardware iterations) to take low resolution photos, and was designed to be used in conjunction with the Game Boy Printer, which would let you print out your photos.</p><h3><strong>e-Reader</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/nintendo-e-reader-1728557132801.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Sticking on the handheld side, the Game Boy Advance was compatible with the Nintendo e-Reader, which scanned barcodes on compatible e-Reader cards to unlock content in GBA games. It’s an early version of a concept Nintendo would revisit a decade later with amiibo, where physical items unlock otherwise walled off content within games. While very niche outside of Japan – the e-Reader didn’t even come out in Europe and was discontinued in America after less than two years – there were some legitimately cool uses for the technology. Most notably, the GBA port of Super Mario Bros. 3 had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/26/super-mario-bros-3-e-reader-hands-on"><u>e-Reader-exclusive levels</u></a> that have been preserved in the Nintendo Switch Online version of the game.</p><h3><strong>Circle Pad Pro</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/circle-pad-pro-1728557241279.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The original 3DS only launched with one circle pad, so Nintendo’s patchwork solution for twin-stick control support was the clunky and hilariously large Circle Pad Pro. Often described as a boat for the 3DS to rest in, the Circle Pad Pro made the 3DS much bigger to hold, adding a second circle pad and an additional pair of shoulder buttons. It was designed to make action-heavy third-person games like Monster Hunter and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater more comfortable to play, but was quickly improved upon when Nintendo released the New 3DS with a built-in second analog stick a few years later.</p><h3><strong>Delicious amiibo</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/mario-cereal-1728557355870.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While most amiibo are figures or cards and some are adorable Yarn Yoshis, the strangest amiibo Nintendo ever released is the Delicious amiibo. Nintendo partnered with Kellogg’s to produce Super Mario Cereal: a Lucky Charms-like cereal with shapes inspired by the Mushroom Kingdom. The twist? The cereal box itself contained NFC functionality and could be used as an amiibo in all compatible Nintendo games. It’s a bizarre one-of-a-kind amiibo that we’ll likely never see again.</p><h3><strong>GameCube Microphone</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/gamecubemicrophone-1728557480055.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo systems like the DS, 3DS, and Wii U have built-in microphones, but that wasn’t the case back in the GameCube days. So what did Nintendo do when it wanted to create voice-controlled minigames for the next Mario Party? It bundled a microphone in with the game! The GameCube microphone was primarily used with Mario Party 6 and Mario Party 7, and  plugged into the console through the secondary memory card slot. The microphone minigames could be very unresponsive at times, but I can’t deny that the big button on the GameCube microphone is extremely satisfying to press.</p><h3><strong>Home Gym Equipment</strong></h3><p>Nintendo has made a fortune off of its fitness games, and each iteration has launched with a different iconic piece of hardware. Wii Fit is responsible for bringing the Wii Balance Board into the world, which ended up being supported by over 100 different games. More recently, Ring Fit Adventure introduced the Ring Con, which sadly hasn’t seen the same amount of love from other software. Still, both exercise games were huge successes for Nintendo, even if <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/05/nintendo-teases-new-experience-for-nintendo-switch-wii-fit"><u>initial reactions to the accessories had us scratching our heads</u></a>.</p><h3><strong>Nintendo Labo</strong></h3><p>I never thought I’d be convinced to buy a $70 box set of cardboard but that was before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/24/nintendo-labo-variety-kit-review"><u>Nintendo Labo entered the picture in 2018</u></a>. Nintendo developed four different Labo sets for Switch, including cardboard creations like a fishing rod, giant robot, steering wheel, piano, and more. The piano was actually pretty satisfying to assemble, as it came with rubber bands to create tension in order for the keys to work. But similar to the feeling I’ve always had after completing a LEGO set, actually playing with the Labo Toy-Con after building them was just never that compelling. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/labo-1728556785301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One Nintendo Labo set was even a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/16/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-review"><u>cardboard virtual reality headset</u></a>, and Nintendo updated several Switch games with <em>very </em>minor VR support that forced you to hold the Switch’s 720p screen mere inches from your face. It was by no means a fantastic virtual reality experience, but it’s far from the worst attempt at VR the company has ever made…</p><h3><strong>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/mario-home-circuit-1728557570098.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Yes, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an enhanced port of a Wii U game, but that doesn’t mean Switch didn’t get its own original Mario Kart… Technically. Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit launched back in 2020 and it remains one of the strangest products the company has put out in the Switch generation. Home Circuit comes with a remote control kart featuring either Mario or Luigi and a handful of cardboard gates to set up around your living room, which you use to play a mixed reality version of Mario Kart. It’s fun for a time – especially if you have a pet that likes to chase the kart around – but I’m mostly just shocked that Nintendo took one of its biggest franchises in such a strange direction for this spinoff.</p><p>What’s your favorite weird thing Nintendo has made over the years? Are you planning to buy the new Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo?

Following discussions with SEGA, our licensors, and partners, we have agreed the best course of <a title="Genres > Action [2,232 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> is to delay the launch until March 2025. Specific platform release dates will follow once confirmed.</p><p>In our last Development Update in September, we explained that we needed to push <em>Football Manager 25</em>‘s original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first instalment in a new era of <em>Football <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger</em>. This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards.</p><p>In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted—despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done. Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.</p><p><em>Football Manager 25</em> is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in <em>Football Manager</em>‘s history by rushing to release it in November. Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture—and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>For the large numbers of you who have already pre-ordered the game, we thank you very much for your trust and support. Given the delay, however, should you wish to claim a refund, please contact your retailer. Something you noted as missing from our announcement on September 30 was mention of Advanced Access on PC and Mac. We can confirm Advanced Access will be available ahead of the new release date and, when we are confident on how long that period will be, we will update you at the first opportunity. The new gameplay reveal will also now move to the end of January 2025.</p><p>We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you. We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry.</p><p>Thank you for reading and your patience. It means the world to us as we continue to work on creating a new era for <em>Football Manager</em>.</p><p>—Sports Interactive and SEGA</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2022, longtime collaborators <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-renames-fifa-series-ea-sports-fc-as-fifa-teases-more-games-coming-this-year/1100-6503293/" data-ref-id="1100-6503293">EA and FIFA split up</a>, leading EA's best-selling FIFA soccer games to rebrand as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-fc-25-review-lacking-title-winning-pedigree/1900-6418293/" data-ref-id="1900-6418293">EA Sports FC</a>. That left FIFA without a video game company to partner with... until now. Konami--whose Pro Evolution Soccer games previously competed with EA's FIFA titles--has now struck an epsorts deal with FIFA for the FIFAe World Cup.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/en/news/release/20241010/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Konami's official site</a>, the company's eFootball games will be utilized for two different FIFAe World Cup tournaments: one for mobile and one for consoles. However, the deal between Konami and FIFA is only for esports, and doesn't involve a new console game or rebranding eFootball as a FIFA title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HulEbrkzZxM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HulEbrkzZxM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We are incredibly excited to join forces with Konami," said FIFA Chief Business Officer Romy Gai in a statement. "This collaboration aligns perfectly with our mission to promote football globally and to provide a platform for players to showcase their skills. We truly believe in an inclusive ecosystem which allows different communities to be part of the FIFAe competitions."</p><p>The national nomination phase for the FIFAe World Cup competition will run between October 28 and November 3. Further details can be found <a href="https://e-football.konami.net/fifae_world_cup/2024/en/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Konami's site</a>, but it doesn't specify what the prize money will be for the eventual winners.</p><p>EA Sports FC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-fifa-no-problem-ea-sports-fc-24-starts-better-than-last-year-ea-says/1100-6518248/" data-ref-id="1100-6518248">doesn't seem to have lost too many sales</a> by dropping its FIFA branding. But it's still possible that FIFA could partner with another video game company to create a rival console title. Konami and 2K seem like natural choices, given their history with sporting games. But for now, there isn't a deal in place for FIFA to go in that direction.</p>

            <p>Sunderfolk is the debut game from Dreamhaven, the game company founded by former Blizzard boss Mike Morhaime.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-blizzard-boss-details-new-company-dreamhaven">Morhaime announced the new company in 2020</a>, which includes a roster of other ex-Blizzard staff and consists of two distinct studios: Moonshot and Secret Door.</p>
<p>Sunderfolk is from the latter: a tactical game inspired by tabletop RPGs, controlled with your phone. Check out gameplay below.</p>

<p>Players will adventure across the Sunderlands, exploring diverse lands, battling monsters, and meeting characterful animal inhabitants. It's all meant to parallel a traditional tabletop game, but made more accessible.</p>
<p>That's through the use of a phone or tablet as a controller, used for everything from inventory management to combat. It's couch co-op, replicating traditional game nights.</p>
<p>Combat itself will be turn-based, with players selecting from a deck of skill cards with which to attack. Fate Cards played each turn will impact effectiveness, adding an element of luck. Players must customise their deck and coordinate with others to ensure victory.</p>

<p>"The team at Secret Door, and really all of us at Dreamhaven, are all about bringing players together around fun experiences," said Morhaime. "Sunderfolk is a beautiful game, it's full of personality and charm, and it also creates epic moments where everyone is engaging directly with each other to work out strategies or celebrate victories. There's nothing quite like it, and we're really looking forward to seeing what players think."</p>
<p>Secret Door studio head Chris Sigaty (who previously worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heroes-of-the-storm">Heroes of the Storm</a>, and Starcraft 2 at Blizzard) spoke of the tabletop inspiration.</p>
<p>"We have a bunch of dedicated board and tabletop game fanatics on the team at Secret Door - getting together for game night has been a regular highlight for many of us going back years and years," he said. "As developers we also like to look at what inspires us and think about how to make those types of experiences easier to get into, so that more people can enjoy them as much as we do. With Sunderfolk, we're excited to offer players a game that's easy to pick up and play, while still challenging to master, and we can't wait to share it with the world."</p>
