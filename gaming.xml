            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>players have figured out a way to discover their SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) rating within the game, a value that's supposed to be hidden from players' view.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-are-getting-activision-to-send-them-their-personal-information-so-they-can-find-out-their-hidden-sbmm-rating" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, this method comes via YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, and it works for every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game you've played since 2021's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>. That's a heck of a lot of data.</p>

<p>As IGN points out, however, it's a method that takes a little while, and you'll have to put in a bit of effort to reap the rewards. You'll have to submit a personal information access request via the <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Activision privacy page</a>, and it can take a couple of days for the data to arrive, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=2Vil6up- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=u5uyfZJv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to find out your&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>SBMM rating? You can do so via a newly-discovered method.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you do get the info (for which you'll also need to log into an Activision account), you'll be granted access to a vast amount of data that, according to IGN and TheXclusiveAce, includes every Multiplayer match you've played on record.</p>

<p>You can see info like the modes and maps you've played with, as well as number of hits, damage numbers, and even the amount of time you've spent moving in each game. Activision really is collecting a staggering amount of player data from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, it seems.</p>

<p>If you don't know what SBMM is, it's a rather hot topic within the multiplayer gaming world. SBMM, or skill-based matchmaking, refers to a method by which players are grouped together in multiplayer games according to their skill level.</p>

<p>Some players have decried SBMM, suggesting it makes games too hard to enjoy as "sweaty" players dominate higher-end lobbies. However, <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extensive experiments released by Activision last year</a> seem to contradict this, suggesting that players do appreciate SBMM when it's present, even if they don't realize it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=iNWu2iF7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=F7UF2pJy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty</em>'s SBMM process is perhaps more popular than players would like to believe.</figcaption></figure><p>The data TheXclusiveAce uncovered isn't necessarily helpful in a vacuum, as it doesn't contain comparison to other players, nor does it show the skill rating of lobbies in which you participated in multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>However, if the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>community comes together to compare data, then a more comprehensive picture of the way SBMM works within the games could be created.</p>

<p>It's well worth watching his video on the subject if you want to learn more about how to access your own data, as well as what it could tell you about your own&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>performance. You can see it here.</p>




<h2>What else is going on in the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>?</h2>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>land, the games'&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>collaboration, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow">first teased back in early December</a>, has now officially landed.</p>

<p>Per the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>blog, the&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover gives you the chance to earn goodies like a new Front Man Operator, as well as new Skins for existing Operators that sport the iconic green tracksuit from the show.</p>

<p>Recently, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">officially surpassed 500 million sales</a>, and that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the series' biggest launch to date, no doubt buoyed by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">inclusion as part of Xbox Game Pass</a> on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-free-weekend-severance-silo-for-all-mankind-1851731841<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple TV+ is a strange ol’ streaming service, spending wads of Apple’s infinite money on incredibly expensive prestige television and movies, and then hiding it all as best it could. In recent months, it’s occurred to the company that perhaps it’d be good if people saw the stuff it’s making, adding the service as an option on Amazon Prime, and now it’s offering a completely free weekend to lure you in. It’s just, there’s also an awful lot of confusion about when it actually starts.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s purportedly not set up such that you have to cancel once the free weekend is over on January 5, which is good. I say purportedly, because right now we’re unable to get it to offer anything other than the standard seven-day free trial, which <em>does</em> require you to cancel. It’s also worth noting that on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s own press release for the offer</a></span>, it describes it as running January 3 to 5, but the embedded video says it’s January 4 to 5. We’ve contacted Apple to get some clarification, but there’s no clear idea exactly when this properly begins.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808"><em>Severance</em>’s Most Complicated Relationship Gets Messier In Season 2</a></span></p><p>If you <em>can</em> get it working, there’s a wealth of excellent stuff to watch on the streamer, genuinely some of the best TV in the last few years. My personal favorite is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silo-apple-tv-renewed-season-2-fallout-amazon-1851721881&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silo-apple-tv-renewed-season-2-fallout-amazon-1851721881"><em>Silo</em></a></span>, an adaptation of the Wool novels set in a post-apocalyptic underground bunker. Then there’s <em>For All Mankind</em>, a wonderful alternative-timeline historical drama set in a version of the world where Russia beat America to landing on the moon, and the consequential space race. Both are gripping dramas.</p><p>Then there’s <em>Severance</em>, Ben Stiller and Adam Scott’s incredible twist on a workplace comedy in which everything is distinctly not OK, Bill “<em>Scrubs</em>” Lawrence’s comedy <em>Ted Lasso</em> following an American coach of a British football team, and indeed Bill Lawrence’s comedy-drama-cum-murder mystery <em>Bad Monkey</em>, with Vince Vaughn finally finding a platform in which he can shine.</p><p>There’s a ton of other sci-fi on there too, among it <em>Invasion</em>, <em>Dark Matter</em>, <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Constellation</em>, and the <em>Godzilla</em> spin-off show <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.</em> Other hugely rated shows include <em>Slow Horses </em>starring Gary Oldman, <em>Bad Sisters </em>with the amazing Sharon Horgan, and <em>Disclaimer </em>starring Cate Blanchett.</p><p>A <em>lot</em> of the above shows have been cancelled, so cruel is the world of spending hundreds of millions on TV shows that don’t ever get a chance to find an audience, but none so brutally as Taika Waititi’s reimagining of Terry Gilliam’s <em>Time Bandits</em>. But, you know, if you’re only planning to blitz the archive for a single weekend, you may as well watch what looks enjoyable.</p><p>Um, Apple has also made some movies.</p><p>Is there a catch? Well, sure. You’ll need to sign up for an Apple ID to do this, which is to say, this is a massive database play by the megacorp, looking to gather vast numbers of email addresses to bombard with further nags. But of course it’s that, and we’re all capable of unsubscribing, or using a temporary email address.</p><p>Whether it actually starts Friday or Saturday (we shall update accordingly), it seems like a pretty decent deal. If you want <em>one</em> show to focus on, pick <em>Silo. </em>And <em>Severance</em>. And <em>For All Mankind.</em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>According to a veteran video game industry analyst, 2025 could be the year that Microsoft goes "all-in" on bringing its Xbox games to other platforms, including PlayStation 5. Microsoft, of course, has already begun to launch some games on rival platforms, but Serkan Toto of Kantan Games believes Microsoft will lean further into that this year.</p><p>Toto told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-finally-gta-6-to-dominate-ai-in-game-dev-again-analysts-predictions-for-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft may opt to do this for a variety of reasons, including helping to pay for its massive buyout of Activision Blizzard and the "huge lead" of PlayStation in the market.</p><p>"2025 might be the year where they go all-in," Toto said. "The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs across the board, the power of forever-titles, the huge lead of Sony, and other factors will likely leave Microsoft no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early, including blockbusters such as Gears of War: E-Day or Perfect Dark."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1377294593" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

including Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush, and Pentiment. Even before this, though, Microsoft was already one of the biggest publishers on PlayStation and Switch thanks to the juggernaut Minecraft series. Call of Duty is now a Microsoft franchise, too, and Microsoft continues to release the game on PlayStation platforms.</p><p>One of the next big Xbox games to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches for PS5 in Spring 2025. Beyond this, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">ongoing rumors of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster project that could launch on PS5.</a></p><p>In May, it was reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft might look to release even more of its first-party games on PlayStation to help increase revenue. There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/an-eternal-strands-demo-is-coming-to-pc-later-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yellow Brick Games has announced that an Eternal Strands demo is coming to PC via Steam on 21st January, giving a sneak preview of their magic-infused action-adventure game a week before the full release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 28th January – it will also be day one on certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet on if a demo will also be coming to console, though <a href="https://x.com/YellowBrick_Qc/status/1874836069608522227">the team responded to a query</a> about this by saying “Steam only for the moment”, which implies it’s a possibility.</p>


<p>Eternal Strands will cast players as Brynn, a young Weaver seeking to recover her people’s cultural home, fighting enemies with a blend of magical abilities and weapons. Core to this, however, is a thermodynamic layer woven throughout the game world so that the elemental use of fire and ice can be applied to the environment to great effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Heat will spread, cold will chill, and there’s real-time destruction that goes hand-in-hand with telekinetic powers. You can, for example, set fire to a tree, then rip it out of the ground and hurl it at enemies with Brynn’s telekinesis. Alternatively, cast a magical ice wall to block incoming attacks, or infuse her sword with flames to waft at enemies.</p>

<p>Brynn is also inherently mobile, allowing her to face off against gigantic enemies that you’ll need to climb up, shatter armour to reveal weak spots, freeze to limit mobility, burn to clear fur, and more in order to defeat. Of course, the magic will also be useful for navigating the fantasy city.</p>
<p>It’s all a rather intriguing additional layer to the action-adventure formula, bringing more interactivity and emergent reactivity to the game. Definitely one to keep an eye on for later this month, as one of the earliest game releases of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-just-getting-started-with-its-connected-universe-says-sam-lake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy Entertainment Creative Director Sam Lake was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDKF2dlK6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by IGN</a> about the prospects of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-game-in-the-remedy-connected-universe-is-already-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which he feels is really just getting started after Control and Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><em>Personally, to me, games are a storytelling medium and, from that perspective, an art form.... It's been a long journey. I can look back and see logical steps through it all, but more and more, I'm looking at it from the perspective of all of these different forms of expression, mediums, and art forms, how games as a very modern medium can hold all of that in them and how in this interactive form we can use everything that has come before and give it kind of a new meaning and context. </em></p>
<p><em>We can really use all of that to create these layered worlds that the player can then go and experience and explore. I feel that we made a very decisive leap forward when it comes to that, but in no way do I feel that we would have kind of reached the end. Already in the process of creating this latest game, there were a lot of new exciting ideas that came about but were not possible to explore in the context of Alan Wake 2.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like we are just getting started, so I feel it's too early to start talking about an endgame. I love tying these things together. I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand and entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting.</em></p>
<p>Sam Lake also explained that how these games will be connected might also incite newcomers to try the other games in the universe made by Remedy.</p>
<p><em>The way we are looking at it, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own on feet, but then for our fans for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story. Also, we feel hopeful that now that there is a universe and a catalog of games that will be expanding as we go, somebody playing their first Remedy game can then continue in the universe and check out the other games as well and dive deeper into that rabbit hole.</em></p>
<p>Lake talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna</a>, too, calling them the perfect partner to work on a film or TV series adaptation. The closest new Remedy project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, though, a cooperative multiplayer that likely won't put too much emphasis on storytelling for a change.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rust-player-count-reaches-new-all-time-high-almost-seven-years-after-release.1073271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a new all-time player count record on Steam, despite the fact that the game is nearing its seventh anniversary (and it's been out for even longer if you count Early Access).</p>

<p>According to the ever-reliable <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>managed to hit 262,284 players within the last 24 hours, which is also the game's all-time peak. Even at time of writing, it's sitting at 200,694 players, so it's not like that spike was a fluke.</p>

<p>Of course, these numbers probably won't come as a surprise if you're a&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>player or if you've been following the game. After all,&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s player count has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowly climbing</a> since its 2013 release, although the 262,284 jump is impressive even within that context.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=QHXBbycJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=4Ezc9Q0T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has hit a new all-time player record on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's driving this player count increase? It's likely that the Steam Winter Sale, during which&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>was available at a 50% discount, contributed hugely to the game's surge in popularity.</p>

<p>We're also just moving out of the holiday season, during which many players will have had more time to play games. Both of these are likely contributing factors to&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s newfound (extra) success, although content creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch likely also shouldn't be discounted.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which "the only aim" is to survive.&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s world is also unapologetically hostile; it's one in which "everything wants you to die", according to developer and publisher Facepunch.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates bringing new features to the game, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-update-adds-military-bases-to-raid-for-goodies" rel="nofollow">military bases</a> to raid for goodies, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-above-ground-trains-update-rolls-out-today" rel="nofollow">above-ground trains</a> to ride, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-september-2021-update-improves-underwater-labs" rel="nofollow">improvements to existing features</a>, among other things.</p>




<p>Sadly, you're a little late to check out&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>as part of the Steam Winter Sale, but you can still grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4415-CUSA14296_00-D11PROJECTRUST01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rust-console-edition/BRPVTJKWHBR7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a> (and current-gen machines via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-fps-selaco-hits-100k-sales-four-times-its-original-goal.1073259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Altered Orbit Studios has announced that ambitious FPS&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major sales milestone that represents a fourfold increase on the studio's original goal for the game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873018637603201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Altered Orbit reveals that&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has sold 100,000 copies, a figure the studio says it "never expected to reach", especially during the Early Access period (which began back in May this year).</p>

<p>Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873021556736150" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">follows up</a> by saying that its original intention was to sell 25,000 copies of&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>in the game's first twelve months on release, but that "somehow", this figure was quadrupled in "just half the time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=2Inn0I7B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=-37znJFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Selaco</em>'s mixture of retro nostalgia and ambitious thinking has resulted in a very respectable sales milestone within its first six months or so on sale.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer says that it decided to go publisher-free and place all its faith "in the game itself", as well as "the community to help spread the word", and it looks like those strategies worked.</p>

<p>Still, Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873023557480935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does acknowledge</a> that others played a role in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>'s success too. Specifically, the studio thanks New Blood's Dave Oshry for doing "more for us than I could fit in an entire Twitter thread", as well as "other developers" who are "always ready to offer help and see their peers succeed". Aww.</p>

<p>Amusingly, Altered Orbit closes its thank-you statements by <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873025470107948" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggesting</a> that players only bought&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>to play its "Burger Flipper" minigame. If that minigame isn't significantly expanded in the full release, I expect boycotts.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>, it's a throwback first-person shooter that promises to offer "thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart enemies, and a fleshed-out story" within what Altered Orbit calls an "immersive game world".</p>




<p>The game owes a debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow">genre-advancing classics like <i>Half-Life</i></a>, and more recent titles like&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>for its action set pieces. That's a pretty heavy cross of influences to bear.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you're still not convinced, perhaps our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre" rel="nofollow">glowing preview</a> will do the trick.</p>

                <p>A Missouri man was busted by cops after getting caught driving 107mph while playing video games behind the wheel, authorities said.</p><p>The Claycomo Police Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ClaycomoPD/posts/pfbid02S9mba42CgpSHaX9gJAKFALX7TcnwTQBhWvBk9JRm9zFQTBcSXDsCmmfSKRPQfegEl?ref=embed_post" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a release </a>that the man, who was not identified, was doing 107mph in a 65mph zone on I-35 in Missouri. "The driver was playing a video game, yes, a video game, while driving 107mph," authorities said. The man also had a suspended license.</p><p>"Apparently he was so distracted he didn't see our motor officer in the lane ahead of him. We forgot to ask if he was playing NASCAR, but we'll assume," the police said.</p><p>The man has a court date pending with "several charges" for what transpired on the roads. The incident took place on the evening of December 27, 2024.</p><p>This was just before a <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/grace-period-ends-for-missouris-hands-free-law-drivers-to-be-ticketed-for-cell-phone-use/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new law in Missouri went into effect on January 1 </a>that prohibits holding a cellphone, reading or sending text messages, or recording videos while driving, with offenders facing a penalty of $150 for the first offense and scaling up $500 for repeat violations.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> studio Arrowhead has shared a number of former pitches, including a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>-style game based within the Helldivers universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938">In a New Year's post on X</a>, Arrowhead CCO and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director, Johan Pilestedt, asked players to share their "expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be", hinting that he was "working on the high concept" to the studio's next release.</p>

<p>Responding to comments from the community, Pilestedt then opened up about a number of "high concept" pitches previously considered, including the Star Fox-esque game tentatively called "Eagles of Democracy".</p>
<p>"We made a prototype in unreal," Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Yurka_Shaman/status/1874267225554903448">added</a>. "It would basically try to capture Starfox. So arcade... but still simulated.</p>
<p>"The title was 'Eagles of Democracy'."</p>

<p>Pilestedt also shared that the team had previously worked on a concept for a top-down reimagining of the 1990 arcade game, Smash TV, too:</p>

</p></div>

<p>"Smash TV is a top-down reimagining of the classic arcade game of 1990," the pitch began which was reportedly written around 12 years ago. "The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game shows.</p>
<p>"The game plays homage to 80s action movies such as The Running Man, Total Recall, RoboCop, and Escape from New York, tying everything together with cheesy music, 'cool' visual effects and over-the-top storytelling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost">Arrowhead recently responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its Killzone 2 crossover</a>, eventually deciding to gift all players the planned second set of the collaboration items for free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-demo-coming-one-week-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Canadian developer Yellow Brick Games <a href="https://x.com/YellowBrick_Qc/status/1874832372568666282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that a free demo for its debut title, Eternal Strands, will be released on January 21, one week before the full game's launch. The demo's content has not been revealed yet, nor do we know if progress will carry over to the full game once purchased.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands is the new game by <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Dragon Age lead Mike Laidlaw</a>. After leaving BioWare, Laidlaw worked on an unannounced Arthurian-inspired roleplaying game at Ubisoft, but that project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ex-chief-creative-officer-canceled-an-arthurian-rpg-from-dragon-age-designer-mike-laidlaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a>. Afterward, Laidlaw founded Yellow Brick Games to make this intriguing fantasy third-person action/adventure title.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, Francesco and I were able to play a short but impressive demo that showcased the game's emphasis on physics. Here's an excerpt from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>What truly makes Eternal Strands stand out is the well-realized magic system. Every spell, from the simplest elemental shots to the more complex gravity-based ones, interacts not only with the environment and the enemies but also with one another. One gravity spell, for example, can propel Brynn forward and up in the air, but it can also be used to push enemies into chasms or to extend the range of elemental shots. In other cases, another spell can make other spells whose effects go off after a short while activate instantly.</em></p>
<p>The story follows Brynn, a young magical weaver and treasure hunter, as she seeks&nbsp;to unravel the secrets of the Enclave with the help of her companions. Long ago, the Enclave was a center of magical development, trade, innovation, and social life. But after arcane disasters spread across the Mayda region, it sealed itself off behind a magical wall known as the Veil. Now, it falls upon Brynn and her fellow weavers to unlock their secrets.</p>
<p>While there will be dialogue choices, despite Laidlaw's background, do not expect big moral choices leading to different endings. However, from what we've played, the action should be very fun. Eternal Strands is also expected to last a decent amount, between 25 and 35 hours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the studio</a>. More content is coming after the January 28 launch, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-launches-january-28-2025-post-launch-collab-with-square-enix-creative-studio-iii-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership</a> with Square Enix’s Creative Studio III Lead Artist Yusuke Mogi (known for FINAL FANTASY XIV Online) to design a new Epic creature, weapons, and armor set. The system requirements for Eternal Strands are listed below; the game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will get it on day one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum</em></strong><br>
<em>• Performance: 60 FPS @ 1080p</em><br>
<em>• Graphic settings: Low</em><br>
<em>• GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super [6GB] / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT [6GB] / Intel Arc A580</em><br>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-platformer-antonblast-is-already-profitable-developer-says.1073244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>developer Summitsphere has announced that the game has already recouped all of its costs related to development, marketing, and production, officially making it a profitable endeavor less than a month after release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tonycomputerentertainment.com/post/3lesqbhu4ys2y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Summitsphere's Tony Grayson reveals the happy news and says it "looks like Summitsphere is going to be making a lot more games for a lot longer", thanking&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>players for their support.</p>

<p>Just in case you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Antonblast</em>, it's a 2D "explosive action platformer" with a visual style that owes a heavy debt to&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>. You can think of it as a cousin to&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, although the two are developed by different studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=M1d8LByN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=KTiKLFyv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Antonblast</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Wario</em>-style shenanigans are already profitable, developer Summitsphere says.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing as either the titular Anton or his "cranked-out coworker Annie", you must do battle with Satan in order to retrieve Anton's prized collection of spirits.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll explore "bizarre worlds", battle "screen-filling bosses", and experiment with what Summitsphere calls a "totally dynamic playstyle" that allows you either to rush through stages at speed or explore them at your leisure.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in what the developer calls an "urban graffiti-inspired art style", which is certainly true, although it's also quite clearly a&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>-inspired art style as well (no shade; I love that art style).</p>

<p>Screenshots don't quite do&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>justice, so check out the trailer below to see what the game looks like in motion.</p>




<p>A game like&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>achieving profitability in just under a month is no mean feat. It's not quite&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>becoming profitable <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days after its launch</a>, but hey, maybe Summitsphere's next game will achieve that lofty goal.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/antonblast-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether the game is coming to other consoles, but given that it's already profitable, I wouldn't be surprised if it did.</p>

		<p>As we get back up to speed in 2025, our first What We Played of the year is more about 2024 and all the holiday gaming we snuck in over the past fortnight. Visiting family for Christmas meant I didn’t have the big consoles to play on, but that just meant I got completely hooked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">Balatro</a> for about a week. I clearly wasn’t the best boy in 2024, because Santa gave me the flu for Christmas, and along with the tail end of the NFL season, Retro Bowl was the perfect minimal thought game. I’ve now taken the Seahawks on a three-peat and am looking to right the wrongs of Atlanta Falcons history in my current season.</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> holiday gaming has included a review of Threefold Recital and some more of The Witcher 3. There was also some more Football Manager 24, where he’s mounting a title challenge with Valencia and into the knockouts of the Champions League.</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> now on the hunt for a new headset, but that hasn’t stopped him from playing a bunch of games over the past couple weeks. He finished off the excellent Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, completing all of the side quests and achievements, and has moved on to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, “which is great but feels a lot less expansive than the first one as most action taking place in the one big open world planet so far.” He’s also finished 9 Sols, though this did mean dropping the difficulty down about two thirds of the way through.</p>
<p>While he’s got Cuisineer and Behemoth on the go for review, <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> Christmas &amp; New Year gaming has also included Black Ops 6 and started Dragon Age The Veilguard – “The latter is as magenta as it gets, but still seems good. The former is, indeed, a Call of Duty game.”</p>


<p>It was a very Bohemian Christmas for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s continued on his playthrough of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. He did a bunch of errands and local mysteries, and has found that everything from eating food, to maintaining Henry’s gear and sparring with a weapons trainer is a bit of a time sink, but he’s enjoying it and is now pushing on with the main quest because he knows there’s a lot of new games coming soon!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played Skull &amp; Bones and….. he didn’t like it – “It looks and plays like someone knock off studio tried to make Black Flag, I really couldn’t believe a full priced game could look that ugly in 2024.” So he tried to have a better time with some Transformers: Galactic Trials, but this part racing game and part shooter “should live up to it’s name and be put on trial, sentenced and thrown in to a pit of Sharkticons. […] By far the worse game I have played in 2024 and thankfully, the last one.”</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> bought Animal Crossing New Horizons for his wife and they’ve been playing it together. “It’s not my usual speed of game, but it’s really cute and a nice thing to do together,” he said, though he’s no doubt a bit befuddled why they’re catching all these bugs and fish and then not turning them into armour.</p>
<p>Rounding us out, <strong>Reuben’s</strong> absolutely hooked on Marvel Rivals and is foaming at the mouth for Season 1 to start, and <strong>Dom’s</strong> basically just found time for some Overwatch 2, Snow Bros. Wonderland and Songs of Silence.</p>
<p>Now then, what did you play over the holidays?</p>

			<p><span>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-mind-blowing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V mod</a> released this week introduces an extremely accurate recreation of GTA IV's Liberty City, complete with all the elements that make it feel like a living, breathing city.</span></p>
<p>The Liberty City Preservation Project isn't the first modding project that attempts to recreate Liberty City in the latest main entry in the series, but it's definitely the most accomplished, as the recreated map features NPCs, vehicles, and sound effects from the original game. In addition, the recreated city also features a fully functional subway system, map, radar, and radio stations. As if all this wasn't enough, the mod also supports an HD texture pack that improves the visual quality of the map and makes it almost feel like the proper Grand Theft Auto IV remaster that has yet to be released. You can check out the mod in action in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Liberty City Preservation Project - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ot_iuEb-ok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first release of the Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project is only the beginning for the development team. As revealed in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/how-world-travel-created-the-liberty-city-preservation-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Intel</a>, the team is looking to restore the majority of the interiors to be identical to those in GTA IV, destructible props, and completely redo the entire maps vertex paintings to make them look even better in Grand Theft Auto V. Once the project is done, the team is also looking to start a similar one, so there may be some amazing recreations of older games' maps in the future.</p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project mod can be downloaded from the modding project's official <a href="https://discord.gg/worldtravel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server.</a></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch helped the Japanese company to rebound spectacularly after the WiiU’s underwhelming tenure. The hybrid console has sold millions in hardware and software and is responsible for some of the highest-reviewed titles of all time. But I think it’s high time the Nintendo Switch 2 scoots its way into 2025.</p>



<p>I’ve always been a “PlayStation” guy, ever since I was a kid. I’ve had the odd Game Boy and DS, but they were fleeting and flirtatious moments—outside of excessive Pokémon&nbsp;binges. I missed out on Metroid, the best Mario games, Zelda, etc, you name it. This all changed the day I decided to invest in a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As a proud Switch owner, I’ve spent the last few years catching up, and I think the Nintendo Switch is a monstrous marvel. However, it feels like it’s outstayed its welcome—despite the addition of the OLED line—and I want something new to play with.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nintendo-switch-has-has-a-good-run">The Nintendo Switch Has Has a Good Run</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Simple and superb. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the obvious downer out of the way—<strong>the Nintendo Switch isn’t very powerful and never has been</strong>. This hasn’t been much of a problem for its colorful and cartoony, first-party titles though. Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-mario-kart-sets-announced-for-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-super-smash-bros-stages-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> have sold a couple of hundred million copies between them, and they aren’t games designed to stretch a console to its limit—<em>maybe</em> for the Switch.</p>



<p>The optimized performance and sheer smoothness of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feel like a minor miracle. But most games can’t hit 60 FPS, and performance varies from title to title—even if the unit is docked. The Switch has reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a>—apparently making it the third-best-selling console behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS—but consumers deserve the best.</p>



<p>I may come across as entitled, but after years of enjoying crispy 4K HDR, 60 FPS gameplay on my PlayStation 5, I want the same for the Switch. I didn’t want to do this, but Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet and Violet was the final straw. What should’ve been Game Freak’s magnum opus, turned into a performance PR nightmare. I bought Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet on day one, and it doesn’t matter how many times Sprigatito bats its precious eyelids at me, I can’t ignore the ugliness of Scarlet and Violet’s choppy frame rate, endless bugs, and lackluster performance across the board.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s array of exclusives is second to none. This is highlighted by the returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in 2025, and a new 3D Mario would benefit massively from a Switch 2. First-party content isn’t an issue for Nintendo and never has been. However, one of Nintendo’s biggest problems could be solved by a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-third-party-isn-t-bouncing-enough">Nintendo’s Third Party Isn’t Bouncing Enough</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I count two pixels here. Credit to IGN’s Mortal Kombat 1 For Switch Review.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you have exclusives selling like hotcakes, I get third-party isn’t much of a concern. I do find it puzzling Nintendo is happy to overlook this segment of the market though. Many third-party titles never see the light of day on Switch, and this is presumably due to technical limitations.</p>



<p>Those that do release have to make serious reductions. Take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-switch-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch</a> and the image of Johnny Cage above. 2023’s fighter is an unbelievable beat ’em up on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with some of the most lifelike graphics and rapid response times. Its Switch port is a shell of its next-gen contemporaries with laughably long load times, blurry graphics, and a huge reduction in textures and performance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, bigger open-world titles don’t perform too badly on Switch. Hogwarts Legacy is still quite rough around the edges but manages to hold up, and The Witcher 3 miraculously plays well—again, at the expense of huge graphical and performance-related downgrades. It’s less a case of “if it can,” and more “should it?” It earns Nintendo more money, but these are titles deserving to be experienced as they were intended.</p>



<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 can improve its performance, even more consumers might favor the portability and dual accessibility of the Switch 2 over a PlayStation or Xbox. More sales mean revenue and happier shareholders. The next console is rumored to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced before April 2025</a>—possibly to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-releasing-march-2025-rumor-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in March 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Providing Nintendo nails it, the long-awaited follow-up could eclipse its younger sibling, and eventually become the top-selling Nintendo hardware in history.</p>



<hr>



<p>The Nintendo Switch’s run is one of the most successful and prolific in gaming history. But are you ready to see what Nintendo has in store with the Switch 2? Which potential titles and franchises would benefit the most?</p>

            <p>If you, like me, rather enjoyed The Rise of the Golden Idol - a game we called "a compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" - then this news may be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Will Ackermann, one of The Rise of the Golden Idol's game designers, has today unveiled his next game: City of Voices. He's working on it in collaboration with pixel artist Matt Frith through his own studio Kini Games.</p>
<p>Described as a "Golden Idol-like" release, City of Voices takes place in suburban England, and focuses on a young girl who on her first day at secondary school gets bullied. If that wasn't enough to deal with, she is soon "thrust into a fantastical adventure", putting even more on her plate.</p>

<p>Like the Golden Idol games, City of Voices will similarly challenge players to "investigate a series of moments frozen in time, examining clues and solving deduction puzzles to uncover a rich story". However, in a change from the Golden Idol games, players will instead need to answer questions by choosing from a selection of images (see below), rather than dragging and dropping words into place.</p>
<p>If this sounds like City of Voices is still treading <em>a little too closely</em> to the Golden Idol formula, don't worry. Ackermann made sure he got the blessing from their creators before cracking on with his own game.</p>
<p>"I was quite nervous about asking Andrejs and Ernests, who co-created those games, for permission to essentially steal their mechanics," Ackermann admitted, "but luckily, they were flattered!"</p>
<p>Frith added: "Since then, they've both been really supportive, and have even said they 'loved every minute of the demo' we've made, which means so much to us. We hope other players will feel the same way."</p>
<p>There isn't currently a release date for City of Voices, but it is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3342470/City_of_Voices/">Steam</a>. You can check out a trailer for it above.</p>

<p>As for The Rise of the Golden Idol, we awarded it four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"This is a brilliantly plotted thriller story stuffed with an enormous cast of memorable scoundrels, buffoons and quietly tragic onlookers, and it's all backed up by wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">Eurogamer's Rise of the Golden Idol review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-vision-pro-3500-headset-reportedly-no-longer-in-production-as-stock-piles-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Apple has reportedly ceased production of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">expensive £3500 Vision Pro headset</a>, as unsold stock has piled up.
</p>
<p>
The detail comes from a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro">The Information</a>, initially published last year, that has now been more widely disseminated (thanks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-vision-pro-vr-mixed-reality-report-1851731279">Kotaku</a>). </p>
<p>
According to sources, Apple component manufacturers had supplied enough parts for at least 500k Vision Pro headsets by October 2024, but had only actually sold around 370k. This had left "tens of thousands of undelivered parts" still awaiting use.
</p>
<p>
Apple reportedly believes it has now manufactured enough components to meet the Vision Pro's overall expected lifetime sales, which are lower than expected.
</p>
<p>
These numbers roughly tally with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-scales-back-sales-target-for-3499-vision-pro-headset-due-to-production-difficulties">report published by the UK's Financial Times last summer</a>, in which components suppliers claimed they expected to produce fewer than 400k units of the Vision Pro by the end of last year.

<p>
That same report claimed Apple had significantly scaled back its internal sales targets for the headset due to production difficulties, after previously expecting at least 1m sales in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Apple has reportedly struggled to easily produce the Vision Pro's two micro-OLED displays for each eye, as well as the device's outward facing lens. 
</p>
<p>
The Vision Pro's cost - around 10 times that of Meta Quest VR headsets - has likely also been a factor, placing the device out of reach of many VR enthusiasts. And while Apple still reportedly has plans to follow the Vision Pro with further devices, the company is still to make its usage case clear.
</p><p>
Apple describes The Vision Pro as a "spatial computer" that "seamlessly blends digital content with your physical space" and navigate apps or media via voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking. Some "spatial games" are also supported, including What the Golf?, Game Room, and Super Fruit Ninja - you can see that in action above.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Apple for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Also included in the promo art is H.E.R.B.I.E., Marvel's Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-Type, Integrated Electronics.</p>
<p>This may not be a surprise for some given The Fantastic Four have long been rumoured to be on the way following datamines that even precede the game's full launch. It's fair to say, however, that some didn't expect their arrival quite so soon.</p> <div>

<p>The timing also ties in nicely with the release of the next Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which is slated to release on 25th July, 2025.</p>
<p>Expect more information when the trailer drops next week.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>, Chris awarded it two stars out of five, saying, "NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun. Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better".</p><p>"I like the invention of special character team-ups, which feels perfectly Marvel in itself. I like the enduring sense of competition it inspires. I just don't truly like much else. The end result is a game that, above all, makes the success of its own rivals much more clear to me."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch at the start of the month. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> has reached another sales milestone, years after its initial release.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/">developer</a>, as of December last year, the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

<p>This latest sales figure means that Stardew Valley has sold a further 11m copies in less than a year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147">February of last year</a>, creator  Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone revealed his game had moved more than 30m copies since launch. Even then, that number was impressive, but clearly the appeal of pixelated chickens and crops is still enough to entice even more players to take to the farm.</p><p>It is worth noting that last year, Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This update introduced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">ability for players to drink mayonnaise</a>, among a vast number of other features such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p>
<p>As for the future, Barone is also working on his next game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. In May of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In the meantime, if it is more Stardew Valley you are after, a new concert <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">known as Symphony of Seasons</a> was announced in November. The concert tour will be coming to the UK in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The yearly speedrunning superstream <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> is starting this weekend, and it's set to be a musical one. The events will include a player who will beat a set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear "all romances" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ah, I totally forgot there are <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout:_New_Vegas_sleeping_partners">eight named characters</a> in Bethesda's radioactive wasteland with which you can do the horizontal hip hooray. Including one robot called "Fisto". Well, you can look forward to that on Thursday. The festival of nippy nonsense starts on Sunday 5th and runs until Sunday 12th. A whole week of saxy shennanigans. You can see the full schedule <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">on the Games Done Quick website</a>.</p>
<p>The appearance of Crazy Taxi during the speedrunning fest might be inspired by news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-crazy-taxi-reboot-will-apparently-be-a-triple-a-game">an upcoming reboot</a>. And the musical accompaniment may include some old favourites from the original soundtrack. Long-toothed taxi drivers will remember the Dreamcast and arcade versions had a punk rock OST with lots of Offspring and Bad Religion, but those songs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbla-psn-crazy-taxi-drops-soundtrack">got removed in later editions</a> of the game due to licensing rights. </p>
<p>However! You can see how the band scheduled for Awesome Games Done Quick performs the Offspring track "Way Down The Line" in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">this submission video</a>, which they performed alongside a playthrough from a player's previous speedrun. They even change some of the lyrics to jokily reference speedrunning. And I enjoy the way they cut off abruptly every time the game timer runs out and the menu pops up. </p><p>As for the jazzy side of things, you might have already seen the saxophonist "Dr Doot" completing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAhTPRQkHdE">a no-hits run of Elden Ring</a> on his own time. This time he'll face a "controlled" set of bosses. It is very satisfying to hear the brassy doots and swoots as he calmly rolls away from danger.</p>
<p>Some newer games are also on the roster. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake will all see speedruns of various kinds. Some ambitious folks are also planning to nip through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, with the organisers allocating 50 minutes to the retro collection. Does that mean they'll spend one minute on each game? Or maybe they're planning to complete as many games in the compilation as possible? I don't know. But it could be an interesting one. </p>
<p>The Games Done Quick organisers regularly raise <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gdq-founder-steps-down-after-13-years-and-more-than-41-million-raised">millions of dollars for charity</a> in their bi-annual events. This year they're once again supporting the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Last year's Summer Games Done Quick (the beshorted beachy brother of the classic January event) saw a Sekiro player interrupted during a speedrun by that most baffling of Windows interruptions - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-sticky-keys-cant-stop-sekiro-master-and-other-speedrunners-from-raising-25-million-for-summer-games-done-quick">sticky keys</a>. But it didn't stop the shinobi slashing from tipping the event over the $2.5 million mark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? "Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suffering">The Suffering</a> 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite </a>enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.</p>
<p>Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Season 2 released yesterday alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/515196931452962768">patch 1.2</a>, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.</p>

<p>The new unit is the Raiden, a giant flyer that fires three bolts of lightning at once at different targets. It’s good at fighting medium units. There are also reworks for the Sabertooth (new model, a new tech) and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overlord">Overlord</a>, which is now “larger, stronger, and more expensive”. Death Knell is a new, scarier version of my beloved large laser boy Melting Point, but is only available in the Brawl and Survival modes, which I don’t play. An actual, tangible tactical thought I often have in Mechabellum when considering my formation is "it needs more pew!", so I might have to branch out.</p>

<p>But the star of the show is surely the new specialist, mostly because of how utterly haunted he looks from his years of service in the mechanised forever wars. The Intensive Training Expert gets an extra 50 supplies in the first round, plus a free intensive training upgrade. That’s the one that levels up a unit. In part, Mechabellum is a game of deciding how much time to dedicate catching up and responding to your opponent’s specific chain of cascading power spikes, so I’m interested to see how much this deeply troubled war bastard will affect things.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">my review</a> of Mechabellum, which I slapped a Bestest Best on. Here’s the paragraph I feel sums the game up best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its truest joys lie in wanton destruction; so unbelievably tactile for a game in which not a single shell casing is spent without minutes between the locked-in trigger pull and muzzle flare’s crescendo. Watching for weak spots, applying the thriftiest dash of pressure without overextending, and watching entire flanks crumble as several rounds of planning pay off - planning that might just have looked like panicked flailing to your opponent. Having the merest snack-sized premonition of a hunch vindicated as you scry the patterns in your foe’s placement, and having already answered their plan with a hearty “not today, fucko” before they’ve even got close to pulling it off.</p></blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[More People Play PvE in Tarkov Than You’d Think]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-people-play-pve-in-tarkov-than-you%E2%80%99d-think.1073175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games introduced PvE to Escape from Tarkov a few months back, and it was a divisive decision that was met with mixed reviews. Many hardcore players claimed it was stripping ‘the point’ out of Escape from Tarkov, while the more casual players welcomed the change with open arms – once they’d <strong>bought </strong>the mode, of course.</p>



<p>In the Tarkov community, playing PvE is somewhat stigmatised. It’s often met with jibes from the more skilled players claiming that it’s ‘the easy way out’, or something similar. However, in a recent revelation, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov highlighted just how many people play PvE – and the number will surprise you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-stevens">Even Stevens</h2>



<p>During a recent Tarkov TV stream, Nikita – the head of the studio at Battlestate Games – got onto the topic of PvE player numbers. It has long been thought that PvE gamers represent the minority in Escape from Tarkov, and while that’s true sometimes, it was proven by the numbers that things balance out over time.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the start of a wipe, 15 – 20% of players choose PvE, and 80% go for PvP. However, as the wipe progresses, the player ratio becomes roughly 50/50%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the ‘wipe’ hits Tarkov – as it did a week ago – hundreds of thousands of players come flooding back to see what’s new and to kickstart an all-new playthrough, taking on the early-game tasks once again. However, the player count dwindles over time, as do other elements like viewership.</p>



<p>It can become stagnant within a month or two, with many players drifting off as the power players become established. Before long, it’s seen as being ‘too late’ to start the wipe, given that you’d be coming in as a fresh player against high-level opponents with the best weapons and armour.</p>



<p>The endgame loop also gets tiring for those who make it there as quickly as possible. Once the core tasks are completed and all the boxes have been ticked, it’s an endless grind of daily and weekly challenges and fruitless PvP battles.</p>



<p>The answer? It’s PvE.</p>



<p>By playing PvE, you access a more balanced playing field – perhaps an <strong>easy </strong>playing field. It’s a great introduction to Escape from Tarkov’s maps, modes, and mechanics, and in PvE, all you’re missing is real-world opponents. Aside from that element, everything else is effectively identical.</p>



<p>As the wipe goes on, 50% of Escape from Tarkov’s players gravitate towards PvE, and that’s a huge figure. Are you one of them? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose is available for free as the latest giveaway game on Epic Games on PC. It follows on from a giveaway that featured Kingdom Come Deliverance, and it’ll be replaced on January 9 by Turmoil – so get it while you can.</p>



<p>In 2019, Hell Let Loose dropped to a solid reception, presenting players with one of the grittiest and most grounded WW2 experiences in modern gaming.</p>

<h2 id="h-war-is-hell">War is Hell</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hell-let-loose-03f036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hell Let Loose</a> is the latest free Epic Games title, available now through January 9.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most heart-pounding FPS titles you’ll ever play, and it’s perfect with friends. It’s a hyper-realistic WW2 title featuring real theatres of war and iconic battles, and at the heart of the game sits a slew of real-world weapons, items, vehicles, and tactics.</p>



<p>Here’s a trailer for the game to give you an idea of what you’re getting into:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This is the last giveaway of the festive period for Epic Games, but it’s not the last giveaway, period. As usual, the platform provider will go on to reward users with free games on a regular rotation, and that’s where Turmoil comes into play on January 9.</p>



<p>For now, you’re free to explore Hell Let Loose and all it offers. Fair warning before you invest, though – it’s best played with a microphone for communications, many players treat it way more seriously than your average shooter, and it’s <strong>hard as nails</strong>. In most cases, you’ll die to a single, unseen shot from a treeline somewhere as you power across the battlefield.</p>



<p>Have fun!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-45-to-41.1073169/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are back with our next batch of games that we are looking forward to in 2025. Today, it is number 46 to 41, covering a range of tastes and styles. There’s racing, management, and a whole load of killing. Buckle up!</p>
<h2>45 – Kingmakers</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>The Medieval Era was a time of war of much warfare across the world, as different people vied for power and thrones. It would have been brutal and the only thing that would have made medieval warfare more brutal is guns. Kingmakers takes players back 500 years to medieval England, arming them with guns to change the course of history in attempt to stop the apocalypse in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers | Winter Games Expo Trailer - Early Access Release in Q1 2025 AD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXujvsd9C58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kingmakers mixes the action with strategy, as you will have a medieval army at your back. You will control where units go to head off enemy forces. To help them you have access to vehicles too, including a truck and an attack helicopter. Kingmakers will also have solo and co-op play too, and it is due out in Q1 2025 for PC.</p>

<h2>44 – Football Manager 2025</h2>
<p><em>PC, PS5, XSX|S, NSW, iOS, Android – March 2025</em></p>
<p>Football Manager 2025 is a departure for the long running management for a couple of reasons. First, it is actually releasing in the same year as its title, purely down to delays. Second, it is the start of a new era as the series is moving to the Unity engine. That means there are a number of changes coming to the series as a result.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First let’s talk about changes. The user interface is going to change to be more modern. Goodbye inbox and hello to more messaging instead.Women’s football is also being added to the game as well. Due to the change in engine, there are some features missing too. International management will not be part of the game, and touchline shouts have also gone, as well as create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. The Premier League license has been acquired though. The game is due out in March.</p>
<h2>43 – Killing Floor 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – March 2025</em></p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 was announced in 2023, and it is coming nine years after Killing Floor 2. Much like the previous games, players will team up to take on an undead army of Zeds. Killing Floor 3 is set 70 years after Killing Floor 2, and the world is overrun by the Zeds. Players are part of the rebel group known as Nightfall.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teams of five will face the relentless waves of Zeds, unlocking skills and weapons to survive the dystopian setting. Some of the classes confirmed are the medic, the sharpshooter, and the ninja, There will be some closed beta tests ahead of Killing Floor 3’s full launch in March, and you can sign up for your chance to take part on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor 3 website.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2>42 – Assetto Corsa EVO</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) – 16th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Much like the name suggests Assetto Corsa EVO is an evolution for the racing simulation franchise, as it will have an open world. This open world is set in the region of the Eifel region of Germany, home to the world famous Nürburgring. The map will eventually grow to cover 1600 square kilometers, all of which laser scanned to recreate an accurate portrayal of the region.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like its predecessors, Assetto Corsa EVO will feature a range of cars, including road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars. Each one of these have been recreated digitally using laser scans to make sure all of their details will be captured right down to the smallest.</p>
<h2>41 – Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap is one of the other earliest games on our release list, coming out later this month. Much like the previous games in the serious, players will be fighting waves and waves of orcs. You are one of the War Mages, each of which have their own skills to master. You can play the game solo or co-op of up to four players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another new addition to the series through Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap are the roguelite build options, meaning no runs will be the same as another. There will be random buffs and debuffs that will impact heroes, traps, weapons, stats, and the levels as well. These will stack too and you will have to decide to keep pushing forward or go back to the castle to improve your character and their stats.</p>
<p><em>Join us next time to look at what games were the first to make the top 40. You can check out our Most Wanted #50 to #46 here.</em></p>
