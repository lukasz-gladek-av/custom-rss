            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Acclaim has just finished its first showcase after the company was resurrected, having previously closed down in 2004. In today’s showcase, Acclaim has shown what games it has on the cards with lots of new IPs, with some of the announced games out today. So, what was announced. Keep reading to find out and get the details.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRIDbeat! – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TATp91aZGe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>GRIDbeat was the first game announced during the Acclaim showcase, and it is described as a rhythm based dungeon crawler. In the game, you are a hacker who has breached the Knoss.OS, a corporate network from which you have stolen some files. However, the system will not let you escape easily, so you have to navigate 50 levels while avoiding the various security protocols. Every move you make has to be in line with the beat of the music. As you make progress you will unlock software tools to assist with fending off the security threats, and be guided by your assistant Dot. A release date is yet to be confirmed for GRIDbeat, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">wishlist it.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Basketball Classics – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_CRBRrUClc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basketball Classics is not a new release but has been on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819630/Basketball_Classics/">PC via Steam </a>since 2019. It is a pixel styled basketball game that spans decades and boasts thousands of players. As you can see from the trailer it is a simplified basketball game which includes a story mode, and you can unlock Legend characters for your teams too. It is currently on sale for £2.51, with the regular price being £7.19. Basketball Classics will be coming to consoles, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pixel Washer – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHk6rCKKkEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pixel Washer looks like a game where someone was a fan of PowerWash Simulator but wondered how the game would play if you were a pig. In Pixel Washer, that question is answered as you are a pig that loves to power wash everything. You start cleaning at home with your basic washer, but as you earn money you can unlock more powerful washers and take on the bigger jobs around town. There also seem to be a couple of twists, with the trailer showing the pig fighting or washing a dragon. This is not a newly announced game, with it first appearing on Steam in 2023 but Acclaim is now taking on publishing duties. A release date has not been set.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tossdown – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgpOFBYTNKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tossdown is a package delivery game with chaos imbued within it. At least that is what the trailer is saying and showing. In Tossdown, you have to deliver packages on time while avoiding hazards like meteors, missiles, enemy gunmen, and a lot more. You can unlock powerups and perks to help fight back against the various dangers, and to assist you with making sure deliveries are made on time. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GROUND ZERO HERO – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6nmoH5bTTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ground Zero Hero is a survival action roguelite in which you fight off various mutants that stalk you across a post apocalyptic wasteland. The best way to fight these mutants is to become a mutant yourself, which gives you access to different abilities that help you take on the hordes. There are different wastelands to explore with their own enemies and mutations to unlock. It seems you can combine different mutations to create a very powerful super mutant. There is a demo coming for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570580/Ground_Zero_Hero/">Ground Zero Hero on Steam</a>, and a release date is yet to be set.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Talaka – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QiM8nJoUL_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Talaka is definitely one of the more interesting looking games to come out of the Acclaim showcase. The art style makes this action platformer roguelite look like a painting in motion. Talaka brings together Afro-Brazilian mythology, with some of the subjects of those myths out to kill Talaka. However, some of the Orisha gods are present to aid Talaka with blessings, but she will need to make choices that will affect the story and lead to branching narratives. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3815370/Talaka/">Talaka is available to wishlist on Steam</a> now. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hH9sIotgOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate may be one for those of you who played the SSX games, especially SSX Tricky. It looks like a stylised snowboarding racing game, and it will have three different modes. The first is Challenge Mode, in which you need to hit high scores by pulling off tricks, collect items, and complete objectives. Race Mode is self explanatory as you race against others to cross the finish line first. The final mode is Chill Mode where you can freely explore tracks and look for secrets. HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate will have multiplayer and it can be<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082730/HYPERyuki_Snowboard_Syndicate/"> wishlisted on Steam.</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH07w3-bMv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest is a 2D platformer set in the mind of Fletcher. After a psychologist appointment goes wrong, Fletcher gets trapped in his own mind prison and needs to navigate it to escape. The game is a another roguelike metroidvania, so you will need to throughly explore all of the various secrets locked up in Fletcher’s mind to get him out of there. You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725470/The_Prisoning_Fletchers_Quest/">The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest</a>, and a demo is on the way too.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katanaut – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OAvYl2TOwPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The final game announced during Acclaim’s showcase was Katanaut. It is a very gory 2D action platformer, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">it is out now on Steam</a> for the promotional price of £11.99. Katanaut is a roguelite set on a space station that has been overwhelmed by cosmic horrors. As you explore and slash your way through the hordes you can unlock new abilities and weapons to use across runs, with runs themselves differing as the pathways change around you.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/acclaim-returns-from-the-dead-with-a-focus-on-supporting-indie-studios-and-original-ip/">announcing its return earlier this year</a>, 90s videogame publisher Acclaim is no longer just a former publisher from the 90s, but a modern-day publisher in today's videogame industry. Today, the company hosted its first PlayAcclaim showcase, where it revealed nine games it is currently publishing, including a 2D action-horror game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">Katanaut</a>, that launched today alongside the showcase.</p>

<p>While only one of the nine titles revealed in the showcase launched today, it's not the only one that's playable right now. Basketball Classics was released back in 2019; its publishing rights have just now been moved over to Acclaim.

            <p>
It is always an exciting time when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/red-candle-games">Red Candle Games</a> are up to something. The sheer variety they've put on display with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a> is nothing to sniff at. Now, it appears they're gearing up for the next project in an appropriately mysterious way. Earlier today, the official Red Candle Games YouTube channel shared a video titled "The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe," and it certainly is… something.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is done in one of those creepypasta kinda video essays, the kind where the voice over has either been pitched down, or performed by a robot, or both. And it's all a bit, well, for lack of a better word, creepy. It opens up with the line "are you really human?" which is a question I thought only Yoko Taro was allowed to ask in video games, but nevertheless, an off putting way to start things.
</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" title="The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynAl_k7AkVM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
What proceeds is something that sounds like a conspiracy narrated by someone called Yuuki about human evolution, and that aforementioned dark legacy of the sun tribe. A tale is spun about an ancient bamboo scroll written in a language never seen before, a real Chinese alchemist named Xu Fu who sought after immortality by venturing to a place called Penglai, and a civilian scholar desperate to learn more.
</p><p>
A couple things worth noting here: the beginning of the video talks about people born with four fingers. Yi, the protagonist of Nine Sols, is a member of a race called the Solarians, who all have four fingers. Solarian obviously stems from solar, much like the sun tribe mentioned in this teaser. Immortality also comes up in Nine Sols, and Penglai is the name of the planet that Solarians are from. So, I don't know about you, but this sure does seem like something Nine Sols is on the way.
</p>
<p>
A sequel? DLC? Something else entirely? It's possible, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-pleasant-surprise-the-gorgeous-sekiro-like-metroidvania-nine-sols-has-a-prequel-manga">get a prequel manga earlier this year</a>. For now, we'll just have to let the conspiracy unravel itself…

            <p>
Summer might be coming to an end, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> isn't quite done holidaying yet. Its new getaway themed Adventure Awaits expansion arrives for all platforms on 2nd October, and ahead of its release EA has shared a first gameplay trailer, providing a better idea of what's in store.
</p>
<p>
A major new Sims 4 expansion means a new world to explore, and in Adventure Awaits' case that's Gibbi Point. Here, players can find three new neighbourhoods: Wanderwood Wilds and its forest trails, Crystal Valley with its sparkling rock formations, and the waterfront Jellyfish Junction.
</p>
<p>
Each of these features its own getaway location where Sims can retreat from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life. There's Wanderwood Wilds' Camp Gibbi Gibbi, Crystal Valley's Love Highland, and Jellyfish Junction's Revive &amp; Thrive. And to aid Sims in their relaxation, Adventure Awaits introduces a new Scheduling Getaway feature enabling players to plan everything from long weekends to summer breaks, even recurring breaks. Additionally, new Custom Venues, in combination with the new Getaway System, mean it's possible to build getaways from scratch, complete with their own activities and rules.

<p>
By way of example, Adventure Awaits includes a Cosy Bed &amp; Breakfast, an Outdoor Kids Camp, a Fitness Retreat, and Cooking Competition - and more are available if you own other expansions. You can create a Corporate Retreat with Get to Work, for instance, an Off the Grid Survival Competition with Island Living, even a Dog Training getaway with Cats and Dogs. 
</p><p>
On top of all that, Adventure Awaits introduces new systems for child Sims. There are new Traits, new Formative Moments that shape young Sims' skills and personalities, evolving Childhood Sentiments that "influence experiences well into adulthood", plus new child focused aspirations (Cool Kid on the Block, for instance), new personality options (Goofball, Creative, Competitive, and Evil), even imaginary friends. 
</p>
<p>
Adventure Awaits also brings new activities. For the young 'uns, there's papercraft, archery, diving, and entymology, plus classic games like hide-and-seek or rock-paper-scissors. Adult Sims, meanwhile, can go kayaking, watersliding, take a spin class, test their survival skills in Elimination Challenges, even become a Park Worker, which offers two career paths: Camp Counselor and Park Ranger. There's a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/adventure-awaits-expansion-pack">little more detail over on EA's blog</a>, and you can see at least some of Adventure Awaits' new features in the gameplay trailer above. Oh, and if you missed it, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS0NxrRJm6I">original reveal trailer is here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Adventure Awaits expansion arrives for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Mac on 2nd October and costs £34.99. Anyone who picks it up before 13th November gets what EA is calling an "early purchase incentive" - the Toasty Tower Lamp, the Toasty Tea Kettle, and the Toasty Tootsies Socks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you thought Elden Ring Nightreign was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">difficult before</a>, then tomorrow's new "<em>high difficulty</em>" mode called Deep of Night won't improve your standing with the game. FromSoftware debuted the new game mode today ahead of its arrival tomorrow.</p>



<p>The new mode makes the whole experience more difficult with enemies that hit harder and Nightlords that you won't be able to prepare for by selecting them ahead of your session. You'll just have to be ready for whatever comes your way, and you'll also be continuously delving deeper into difficulty levels the longer you survive.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Deep of Night Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-qY-Lb37eE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All that said, you won't be left to fight these increased challenges with the same weapons you use in the rest of the game. Your weapons will also get a boost, but it'll come at a cost, since weapons you pick up will also have detrimental effects that could prove to do more harm than good.</p>



<p>The right build, however, that's smartly put together can help you steamroll even the more difficult enemies you'll face in the Deep of Night mode.</p>



<p>Depth Relics are another new element added to the Deep of Night game mode, and are only available in Deep of Night. These new, stronger relics can be used in combination with your other relics, since they are each slotted into three new places. </p>



<p>All together, Deep of Night is clearly only for those players looking for the next level of challenge in Elden Ring Nightreign. Try it out at your own risk.</p>

            <p>
It's that time of year, where the weather starts to get a bit chillier, cafes start to reintroduce seasonally appropriate hot beverages, and of course, the arrival of a new Football Manager is in sight. Sports Interactive announced the release date for this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 2026</a>, earlier today, which you may be pleased to hear is only a couple of months away: November 4th.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot of firsts with this year's version of the digital beautiful game. For one, it's been made in Unity for the first time, a fact that I'm sure at least one of you will bring up if this one ends up being a bit rubbish despite likely having nothing to do with what engine it was made in.
</p>
<p>
The bigger, and more exciting new thing is the introduction of Women's Football. While this should have been introduced years ago (can't have been that hard, can it Sports Interactive?), as the old saying goes, better later than never. A press release says Women's Football has been "seamlessly integrated into the FM ecosystem as one footballing world" and that its arrival is "backed by the most comprehensive database of its kind and a host of licensed competitions set to be revealed in the coming weeks."
</p>
<p>
With this entry of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim you'll also find the debut of the Premier League, complete with licensed club badges, kits, and player photos. On top of that, Football Manager 2026 has a "re-imagined" user interface that should give you a bit more control moment to moment. It's also meant to be just generally more intuitive, for both newbies and those who've been playing for a while.
</p>
<p>
Football Manager 2026 arrives on November 4th, later this year.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gorillaz-revive-26-year-old-flash-game-site-kong-studios-2000624770</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gorillaz-just-revived-their-26-year-old-flash-game-site-and-it%E2%80%99s-wonderful.1294071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, here’s something unexpected: Kong Studios is back. The OG <a href="https://kotaku.com/gorillaz-fornite-festival-leaks-forza-horizon-japan-xbox-sony-evo-analogue-2000619149">Gorillaz</a> Flash-powered site from the late ’90s was a popular destination for fans and features mini-games, music, and more. And now you can return to an updated and modern version of Kong Studios.</p> <p>Kong Studios first launched in 1998 and was the coolest place for fans of the fictional animated band. I should know, I used to visit it many, many years ago and struggled to use it on my dial-up connection. <a href="https://kotaku.com/over-36-000-flash-games-have-been-saved-and-are-now-pla-1841389493">The site was powered by Flash (RIP</a>), and over the years following its launch, it grew bigger and bigger, adding more content to find, virtual rooms to explore, songs to jam out to, and lots of fun Easter eggs for fans. Then in 2008, after a decade of support, the site was closed and forgotten. However, that all changed today as Kong Studios is operational once more.</p>  <p>On September 10, <a href="https://kongstudios.gorillaz.com/">Gorillaz released a new updated version of Kong Studios</a> that features a <em>Doom</em>-like first-person shooter experience where players have to fight off the zombie apes as seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V_xRb0x9aw">band’s video for “Clint Eastwood.”</a> You can skip that and just enter Kong Studios directly, and if you do, you’ll find a much higher-res version of the nostalgic site. There’s plenty to click on and explore in the lobby of the place, and Gorillaz promise that more rooms and content will be added to Kong Studios in the future.</p>

 <p>“Kong Studios is the home of Gorillaz and a gamified fan experience where you can explore the rooms and spaces of 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel,” explained Gorillaz on the site’s <a href="https://gorillaz.com/Kongstudiosfaqs/">FAQ page</a>. “It’s also a place to go to find out everything you want to know about Gorillaz, first.”</p> <p>I’m very happy to see Kong Studios return, and not just because I’m a big Gorillaz fan. Over the last decade or so, we’ve seen more and more of the internet and the culture around it move from distinct places to large social media networks and apps. <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-closing-forums-and-moving-people-to-discord-1847684851">Forums are closing. Fan sites are dying</a>. Instead, everyone and every brand is just using Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and TikTok to interact with fans and other people. And while that’s fine, it isn’t as cool as the old internet, where every band and person had their own site. Or where forums were controlled directly by the companies or groups themselves.</p>

 <p>The old internet was a weirder, wackier, and often more interesting era that I miss. While Kong Studios won’t bring that back by itself, it’s great to see a band as popular as Gorillaz realize that having your own place on the web might be valuable in 2025 as apps and networks get stuffed more and more with AI and bots.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s a walkthrough of the old Kong Studios so you can see what they took from us.</p>  
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/gorillaz-revive-26-year-old-flash-game-site-kong-studios-2000624770]]></content:encoded>

And after lots of speculation about what the mode would and wouldn't include, we now know enemies will be stronger across the board, and players won't get a heads up about which Nightlord they'll be fighting, nor if they'll get a Shifting Earth event in advance, so you won't be able to prep a build for any specific type of run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, to counterbalance this, players will be able to collect new types of weapons and relics with even more powerful effects, though they may also have some new drawbacks attached as well.

<figure><a title="Feature: Final Fantasy: The Ivalice Chronicles Interview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d63fed4ec738/feature-final-fantasy-the-ivalice-chronicles-interview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Boy, Square-Enix really wants us to party on our Switches like it’s… 1997.</p>
<p>Because over the last few years, they’ve made three separate titles in a newly minted, old-school RPG franchise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, and then there’s the upcoming Switch 2 release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, the defacto RPG game that caused a brand distinction between Nintendo and Sony nearly three decades ago.</p>
<p>And now, we are getting a remastered release of 1997’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, a game certainly among the most cherished releases within Square’s original canon. This is starting to feel like a <em>thing</em>.</p>
<p>In promotion of Ivalice Chronicles' upcoming release, the game’s director, <strong>Kazutoyo Maehiro</strong>, and art director, <strong>Hiroshi Minagawa</strong>, sat down with Nintendo Life and discussed returning to Final Fantasy Tactics and all its heavy themes, why this version differs from the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions">War of the Lions</a> re-release on the PSP a decade and a half ago, and where they see old-school RPGs as a genre fitting in within Square Enix as a whole.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Alan Lopez for Nintendo Life: The original Tactics came out in 1997, around the same window of time as FFVII, and I find that footnote really interesting. It was kind of a historical fork in the road between the…classic RPG turn-based style, versus [games] aspiring for more cinematic, action-based graphics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Similarly interesting to me, the remake of Tactics is coming out in 2025, a time within the broader RPG [genre] when there’s been a sort of resurgence towards more “classic-style”, turn-based games: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, the renaissance of the Fire Emblem franchise, etc. So my first question is, why did you decide to bring back Final Fantasy Tactics now, and what does this style of gameplay mean to both of you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kazutoyo Maehiro (Game Director):</strong> So it just so happens that a few years ago, both of us had the chance to [re]play the original Final Fantasy Tactics. And I think through playing the original once again, we were able to reaffirm just how great the overall game design and story were. You know, it’s been almost 30 years since the original has come out, and there’s a ton of fans who have loved this game over the years, but we really haven’t had the chance up until now to put out any kind of remaster.</p>
<p>Through playing the game, we realised how great the story and the game was, and we just kind of had the feeling that we really wanted to bring that to players in the modern age. It’s been almost 30 years…there are a ton of fans of the game, but there are also a lot of people who have heard about the game but had never had the chance to play it. I think part of the overall vision of this project was to bring this game to those people as well.</p>
<p><strong>I just played the demo before this interview and was reminded that the game features a lot of themes that are almost closer to historical fiction…I mean, I don’t claim to be encyclopedic about every Final Fantasy ever released, but [Tactics] feels more grounded in reality in its story to me. The theme of the demo [</strong><strong><em>Note: we played an early battle in which you discover a party member has switched allegiances for higher pay</em></strong><strong>] was a classic conflict between</strong> <strong><em>class</em></strong><strong>, not identity. I’m curious if there was any conscious decision to re-release Tactics today in light of those ideas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> Whether you played the original Final Fantasy Tactics as it came out 28 years ago, or you’re playing The Ivalice Chronicles, which has a lot of script updates and edits from [series writer Yasumi Matsuno], I feel like a lot of the social aspects in the game’s story are still relevant today.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it really was a matter of [any] situation now that we’re putting it out, but [rather], I think it’s more the fact that the story still resonates, even so much later, and that’s the amazing part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Hiroshi Minagawa (Art Director):</strong> You know, this is something that Yasumi Matsuno himself has been sharing during some of the interviews that I’ve had an opportunity to also be a part of. We really feel like the social aspects of what’s being discussed and grappled with in this game as they pertain to the world still definitely haven’t changed fundamentally over the past 28 years. I feel especially when playing the game, some of those themes will definitely resonate with players. That’s something that I strongly feel.</p>

<p><strong>I want to talk a little bit about the Classic and Remastered modes</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you go online, people are</strong> <strong><em>so</em></strong> <strong>opinionated about [video game remakes] that change anything, or maybe not changing enough. And it’s an interesting thing with the medium of games, because in other mediums, you’ve got your Spielbergs and your Lucases who will never hear the end of [it for] changing something. But in games, there’s this cultural willingness to do quality of life updates, or updating things for new hardware…so I’m curious how you personally balanced the reverence for this game…with making big changes like, for example, the addition of voice acting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> I think it’s kind of like what you said… maybe I’m kind of the same, but when you go back and play older games, the bigger a fan you are of the game, the more averse you are to making changes. But at the same time, you think about the 28 years since the original has come out, and the different platforms that have come out, and we see a lot of advances in the overall way that interface and controls have been set up. One of our goals with The Ivalace Chronicles was to bring in new players who haven’t been able to play Tactics yet. I think with that in mind, it was a <em>must</em> for us to update the UI and controls to make it more of a modern experience. That’s why we have all of that packed into the enhanced version of the game.</p>
<p>But as I was mentioning, there are people who are fans that might just want to play the original version of the game as they remember it. That’s why we ended up putting the classic version of the game in there. It might not be standard practice to put in two different versions of a game, but we ended up going with that with that thought process in mind.</p>
<p><strong>But you still ultimately end up being the arbiter of preservation. So, for example, there are people who are upset that the updates from the PSP version of the game are not included, while others love your changes and think it’s more approachable. I’m curious [if you view] your role as a sort of preservationist…did you feel the weight of how this game will be remembered?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> [For me], I was actually involved with the graphics side of things, that was my main jurisdiction. And when it came to the classic version of the game, because the approach was to recreate the original version of the experience as faithfully as possible, in a way it was really quite straightforward what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the question of '<em>How much</em> do we really want to push things and change things up?' was something that we really needed to figure out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when it came to the enhanced version of the game, the question of '<em>How much</em> do we really want to push things and change things up?' was something that we really needed to figure out. Making those early decisions was certainly a very critical point of discussion for us.</p>
<p>One way to think about this, since I was one of the people involved in the development of the original game, I mean, if I had made the decision that we should drastically change the graphics for this iteration, you know, I’m sure my team would have followed suit with that. But ultimately where we landed was that we wanted to take the style from back then and really try to modernise it for today’s audience with modern platforms.</p>
<p>And there’s kind of two reasons for this. The first was, because I was involved with the development of the original game, the memories I had for what it was like working with the development team members at that time [and knowing] what thoughts went behind why we created the original game was something that had a very special place in my heart, emotionally. This was my first project I was involved with when I joined the company. Because of those things, I really wanted to be able to bring back that style from back then and try to bring new life to it for modern consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> I think if we switched gears and talk about this from a game perspective, specifically the PSP version The War of the Lions... when that came out [in 2007], there were other [Square titles] that came out around that time, so we added in characters for that — we added Balthier from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_xii_the_zodiac_age">FFXII</a>, Luso from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a> — for myself, thinking about the time during which that game came out, and the content that was in there, (those choices) made a lot of sense, and made a complete package for that version of the game.</p>
<p>But I think if we look at the strategy RPG genre as a whole (which I myself am a big fan of), once you get into it, sure, you realise how much fun it is, but the truth of the matter is that it’s really a little bit of a niche genre overall. So when we thought about it, for this version of the game in particular, we were trying to take the original version and give it a sort of “rebirth”...[and] one of the goals that we had for [The Ivalice Chronicles] was to expand the genre! So we felt by taking the content from the original and putting it back to the way it was, we could hopefully achieve that goal.</p>

<p><strong>How involved were you with the casting of the voices? [In playing the demo] I had the feeling of when you watch a movie based on a book you’ve read and you’re like, “Oh my god,</strong> <strong><em>that’s</em></strong> <strong>what Ramza has sounded like this whole time?” [laughter] I thought the voice acting was very good! I’m a notorious dialogue skipper, yet I didn’t want to skip any of the dialogue because the voices were so interesting to me. So I’m curious how close you were to the vetting of their voices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> First of all, I’m so happy that you liked the voices so much. [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Me too! [laughter]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> As you were saying, it’s been a really long time since the original came out, and I think over time the fans have developed in their heads for themselves what maybe the characters sound like. I think with that in mind, it’s difficult to match what everybody thinks these characters sound like. But in order to not stray too far from what [we believe] people think they should sound like, we kept [the fans] in mind when we went through the whole selection process.</p>
<p>We also worked very closely with Yasumi Matsuno (original writer/director of Final Fantasy Tactics), and with him we tried to figure out what voices would match what players might think these characters would sound like. I think overall, we were really able to get some good selections for both the English and Japanese voices that really added to the feeling and drama of the overall story.</p>
<p><strong>Was there any debate internally over the voices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> Mmmmm, to be honest, not really! When it came to the casting part, we had the support of Matsuno-san, and with his support, the whole process went really smoothly. And I think the same can be said for the recordings. We actually had the help from the same team that did the voice recordings for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, so I think with that experience, it was an overall smooth process. But it’s not even just the dialogue scenes, we had all the battle scenes that we had to record as well. And even when it came to those, we had a really good process overall.</p>
<p><strong>Is it true that the original source code for Final Fantasy Tactics was lost?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> Technically speaking, yes. And I think it has a lot to do with how games were made back in the day. Back in the day when we were making the original game, we didn’t really have the resource management tools that we have now. [Takes his hands and slowly alternates stacking them onto each other.] We’d make the Japanese version of the game, then we’d go on to make the English version of the game, which after we’d make that, we’d essentially just overwrite the original version to make the new one… and we’d just keep overwriting and overwriting. So that “original” version doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’d just keep overwriting and overwriting. So that “original” version doesn’t exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically what we had to do today was use any resources available to us, whether that be the retail version of the original game, or the master disc that we had in our archives, the smartphone version… we basically took these different versions, analysed them, and tried to build up what we felt was the “original” version.</p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> And speaking to the graphics side of things, typically during game development, you receive bug tickets to address. And during the development [of The Ivalice Chronicles], there were some issues that would come up that have actually existed since the original game. [laughter]</p>

<p><strong>What is it like to art direct that, when you’re trying to emulate something by remaking it by eye, almost? What does that do to the creative process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> Well, to first speak about how the process was like for the original game’s development, when it came to the character artwork and designs, Akihiko Yoshida [former Square art director] would be the one to make the artwork itself, and from there, I would be the one who would think about how to capture that artwork and display it on the screen.</p>
<p>When it came to the PS1 version, of course some of the technical specs of that platform were much lower, so the question I had to ask myself was, 'How can I take this world that Akihiko Yoshida is trying to make and really try to capture that and bring it out into the actual in-game environment?' If I were to have [directed] things in a straightforward manner, it might not [have been the same].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Which parts should I hold myself back?' That was the biggest challenge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conversely, with the enhanced version of Ivalice Chronicles, now the technical specs of the hardware have increased exponentially. So if there were things that we wanted to do, we [could] do it, but if we were to do them, it kind of undermines some of the balance we wanted to be able to strike with trying to maintain the atmosphere of the original game. The biggest challenge in this new context was…walking that fine line between what I want to pursue versus 'Which parts should I hold myself back?' That was the biggest challenge I had.</p>
<p>To give just one example, we were of course designing things practically, keeping in mind people playing the game on the Switch, on a handheld device, while there will also be people playing this on a TV screen, like this giant one behind us. Ultimately, the graphical expression needs to be the same across both of those environments, but if we were to keep one in mind more than the other, then it would [negatively impact] the other one. We had to think around that by adding things like filters, and display things in an easier-to-see manner. How to really optimise every visual display, I really had to think through.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, we’re being called on for the final question now… kind of returning to the question from the top, Square has in recent years been releasing more classic-style RPG titles, like this Tactics remake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">Triangle Strategy</a>, Octopath Traveler, and others. So in light of this [development] experience, I’m curious how you personally would like to see these types of games evolve — a genre you called “niche”, and what many might even call “pure”? Do you both view games like</strong> <strong>Tactics a</strong><strong>s an “other” thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> So for The Ivalice Chronicles, we’re releasing it as that “classic” game experience, but of course within Square Enix we have other games, such as the Final Fantasy VII remake series, which has the latest end specs. From my perspective, it’s not really one or the other that’s the right choice, [but] in tandem, they progress together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel as though [Square Enix fosters] an environment where we, on the ground level, if we want to pursue this type of an idea for a game, we’re in an environment that allows us to pursue that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the [advancement] of gaming platforms, there’s a lot more expression you can put out in games, whether that’s a classic style game or a AAA style game, it can be either. What we want to be able to deliver to players is <em>either</em> of those experiences. I think what we’re able to do at this point for players…is really about providing both of those experiences, so players can choose what <em>they</em> want.</p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> This is one of those things where people might have different feelings about what they think about Square Enix as a company, overall. But at least for me, I feel as though [they’ve fostered] an environment where we, on the ground level, if we want to pursue this type of an idea for a game, we’re in an environment that allows us to pursue that. And both Maehiro and I were involved in Final Fantasy XVI prior to our involvement [with] this project, and [that] was definitely more of a “higher end” experience.</p>
<p>But then right afterwards, we wanted to pursue a project like this one, and we were allowed to pursue this as well. So rather than the company dictating what it is that we should do, I feel like, especially since we ourselves are players, if there’s something that we are interested in, they’ve allowed us to pursue that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> launched back in May to positive reviews from fans and critics. But like with most Ubisoft games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-free-updates-assassins-creed-shadows-road-map-1851778558"><em>Shadows</em> has continued to be updated over time</a>. And tomorrow’s big 1.1.1 update is its biggest yet, making it the best time to return to the game’s gorgeous digital recreation of Japan.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv">On September 10, Ubisoft released the full patch notes for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> update 1.1.1</a>, which is arriving on all platforms on Thursday. This is a massive update. The big star of this new patch is that it adds support for the game’s first major DLC expansion: <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. This DLC is launching on September 16 and will be available to anyone who pre-ordered <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> ahead of its launch earlier this year. It will also be sold separately. The upcoming expansion adds a whole new region to the already massive in-game world of <em>Shadows</em>, as well as around 10 hours of story content, missions, and activities.</p> <p><em>Claws of Awaji</em> adds a new weapon type for Naoe, one of the game’s two playable characters, to use: The fast and hard-hitting bo staff. But you don’t need to buy the DLC to get this new weapon. Ubisoft has changed plans and announced on Wednesday that all players will get access to a bo staff after completing a new free quest being added in update 1.1.1.</p>

 <p>“Originally developed exclusively for the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone… for FREE,” explained Ubisoft in the patch notes post for 1.1.1. “You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16<sup>th</sup>.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, update 1.1.1 also adds a ton of free stuff that will be available on September 11. For starters, Ubisoft is increasing the level cap (again) and now you’ll be able to level up to 100, letting players get even more powerful. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-no-animal-killing-zoo-1851781328">Your in-game hideout is also getting some new features and upgrades</a>. Here’s what Ubisoft had to say about the new hideout changes:</p> <blockquote><p>With the new update, each unique building now includes 2 additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside 3 new Hideout levels. These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will also get two new gear levels: Mythic and Artifact. Ubisoft makes it sound like upgrading weapons and armor to these new levels will take some time, and that it’s mainly an option for players who are playing on new game+ and need extra help against the tougher enemies. Here are the full patch notes from Ubisoft, which are very long but include details on a lot of other neat changes, fixes, upgrades, and tweaks.</p>  <h2 id="QURESVRJT05BTCBISUdI">ADDITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</h2> <h3 id="VW5jYXBwZWQgQ3V0c2Nl">Uncapped Cutscenes</h3> <p>Cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS (PC Only).</p> <h2 id="TElTVCBPRiBCVUcgRklY">LIST OF BUG FIXES</h2> <h3 id="R2VuZXJhbMKg">General</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where the game crashed during the cutscene of the “Chained” rift.</li> <li>Fixed various localization issues.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the vertical sliding sound effect continued if you switched characters during a slide.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where some tutorials repeated themselves after unlocking Yasuke.</li> </ul> <h3 id="R2FtZXBsYXnCoMKg">Gameplay</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where the Naginata Ronin were not vulnerable after using the Vault ability.</li> <li>Addressed an issue where the Scale of the Koi and Soaring Tatsu trinkets were not functioning as expected.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the aiming reticle option “Only While Aiming” was missing from the settings.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where a persistent “New Item” notification appeared after looting weapons from scout supply chests.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to start horse archery in Iga because the quest giver had moved locations.</li> <li>Fixed an issue Ikko Ikki Kamon banner was missing after completing the “Collection of Crests” quest.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the Mount Nukai contract targeted a chest that was already opened.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where multiple waypoints were not synchronizing.</li> </ul> <h3 id="RGlmZmljdWx0eSBPcHRp">Difficulty Options</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue on Nightmare difficulty where Teppo enemies appeared broken.</li> <li>Fixed an issue on Nightmare difficulty where the Samurai Spear Guard had a combat glitch.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where Canon Mode disabled itself on the second launch of the game.</li> </ul> <h3 id="SGlkZW91dMKg">Hideout</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue in the Hideout when selecting the option to duel with Naoe or Yasuke did nothing.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in the Hideout where certain buildings or set pieces could not be rotated.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in the Hideout that prevented players from moving the horse stables after changing their original location.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where Rufino remained stuck in the Hideout after being recruited.</li> </ul> <h3 id="U2tpbGxzLCBBYmlsaXRp">Skills, Abilities &amp; Upgrades</h3> <ul> <li>Addressed an issue where the Shadow Piercer ability was not functioning correctly.</li> <li>Addressed an issue where the 33% health recovery on posture attack perk was not functioning as expected.</li> </ul> <h3 id="VmlzdWFscyAmIEdyYXBo">Visuals &amp; Graphics</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed various visual issues.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with the architect’s lip sync in the “Seta-Killers” quest.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue affecting Yasuke’s aim with the Teppo when wearing variations of the Samurai Hat.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with the Ronin Kasa Hat.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with the Blush of the Earth bow quiver.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with Oni’s Flesh Armour.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue where Gashadokuro’s mask did not have red eyes on the Memories screen.</li> </ul> <h2 id="U1BPSUxFUlMgV0FSTklO"><em>—SPOILERS WARNING!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what you need to know.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is officially<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-global-release-times-confirmed"> releasing on September 12</a> for <em>most </em>platforms. The exception to that is the Switch 2 edition that won't arrive until later in October. It's one of the most anticipated games of 2025 and fans of the Borderlands series have been eagerly awaiting its arrival since it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-with-teaser-trailer-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2024">first announced last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the release date upon us, however, you may be wondering if it's actually worth preordering the game now or waiting. I've played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-games-in-order">every mainline Borderlands game</a> with my dad over the years, so this is a question that I'm especially interested in. My dad has informed me that he's planning on preordering the Super Deluxe Edition of the game purely for the added DLC, but I'm thinking I'll probably wait a bit longer to see if I can get a discount later down the line. There's a lot to consider, but to start here's a quick rundown of the main editions you can preorder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Preorders - What Comes With Each Edition</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are really only two editions of the game worth preordering. There's the standard edition, which comes with the base game <em>and</em> a preorder bonus as well as the super deluxe version, which comes with a bunch of extras as well. Here's a quick breakdown of each:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Standard Edition</h3><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223086"><div id="223086" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard edition of the game is exactly what it sounds like. It's the base game for whatever platform you choose. If you decide to preorder it ahead of release, you will get a preorder bonus called the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/gilded-glory-pack/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilded Glory Pack</a>. This includes a Vault Hunter Skin, a Weapon Skin, and an Echo 4 Drone Skin. Beyond that you will get your copy of the game on day one and will be able to play it right away.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Deluxe Edition</h3></div><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223087"><div id="223087" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The super deluxe edition of the game is almost double the cost of the base game. It includes the full base game, the Firehawk's Fury Weapons Skin, the Ornate Order Pack, the Bounty Pack Bundle, the Vault Hunter Pack, and the preorder bonus Gilded Glory Pack. The main reason to get this edition, however, is for the additional DLC content and playable characters that come with the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4-bounty-pack-bundle/9MWDKHJH6G7B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bounty Pack Bundle</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4-vault-hunter-pack/9PG964GJNRF8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault Hunter Pack</a>. These two add-ons include new areas, missions, bosses, regions to explore, and two additional playable characters that don't come with the base game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is It Actually Worth a Preorder?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're on the fence about deciding whether or not it's worth preordering, I'd say it really comes down to whether or not you're willing to pay full price for the game, whether or not you care about the preorder bonus, and whether or not you care about playing the game on day one. It's unlikely that the price of the game is going to really drop until next year, so if you <em>do</em> really want to dive into it on day one then there's really no reason not to grab a preorder now. The bonus you get is just some additional skins and weapons, so if you don't care about that the real benefit is getting your copy as soon as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like with any AAA title, however, it's worth noting that there will likely be bugs you'll be contending with in the early days of gameplay. Randy Pitchford has already made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-day-1-patch-does-a-lot-randy-pitchford-says-but-dont-expect-miracles-from-older-pc-hardware">comments about the day 1 patch</a> you'll have to download once you actually have the game, and it's highly likely even more patches will come. So if you want the best possible gameplay experience, it's probably worth waiting a bit until all of the kinks are worked out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I plan on waiting until the game gets discounted simply because I can't stand paying the full price for any video game anymore. I'm definitely excited to play co-op with my dad, but since he's retired he'll blow through the whole thing on his own multiple times before I'm actually going to be ready to jump in there with him so there's no rush for me to buy now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">No one can accuse <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> of being a short game, or lacking more reasons to stick around after its main campaign wraps up. Ubisoft itself recommends you set aside 60 hours to reach its end credits, which eventually roll after you complete missions meant to cap off the personal journeys of its dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. Six months after launch, my save file is now north of 100 hours, as I continue to explore further untouched corners of its map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that said, Shadows' story still feels incomplete. When those credits eventually do roll, several key story threads remain unresolved, such as the location and true status of Naoe's monther, as well as the last of three mysterious boxes — the hunt for which drives much of the game's plot. Yasuke, meanwhile, declares his mission to hunt down Templars is only just beginning. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's something of an odd note for a finale — but then, with the 10-hour Claws of Awaji expansion set to continue the story (and release free for those who pre-ordered Shadows, as an apology for the game's delay), it's clear that Shadows' end wasn't really the finale of its story at all. Assassin's Creed games have long had DLC to continue the adventures of its heroes, but never before has an expansion been so closely tied to the story of its base game, something which should make Claws of Awaji feel more essential, while also upping the pressure on its makers to ensure it delivers. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Claws of Awaji is the work of Ubisoft Bordeaux, the team behind the enjoyable but inessential Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC Curse of the Druids that went on to lead the well-received Assassin's Creed Mirage. In a recent visit to the studio, I sat down with Claws of Awaji content director Simon Arsenault to find out how his team worked closely with Shadows' lead studio Ubisoft Quebec to continue Naoe's story and deliver "proper closure" to fans awaiting answers at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we started, we pitched a couple of ideas," Arsenault said. "Eventually we met with Quebec. They had thought of stuff before because they've been working on the project like two or three years before we jumped in. But that doesn't mean that they wanted to realize it — it was just an idea. Everyone can have ideas — that's kind of the easy part. You come up with an idea and then you trash it. That's easy. But trying to kind of act on it and figure out every detail of it, that's where the real craftsmanship is. So they had thought of stuff, but they weren't necessarily attached to everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Ubisoft Quebec] already had some backstories prepared for Naoe's mother and how she and [Naoe's father Fujibayashi] Nagato had met, for example. So it was kind of easy to grapple those ideas and say 'Okay, how can we make it? Well, she was the first Japanese-born Assassin. Cool. How does that translate in their relationship?'"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling too much of Shadow's introduction, it's safe to say that Naoe heads to the game's new island of Awaji after being given strong reason to believe her mother Tsuyu is being held captive there. Upon arrival, Naoe then uncovers the truth about Tsyu's status — and hears word of that final mystery box — which sets her off on the expansion's main adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main game didn't have as much personal relationship," Arsenault says, discussing the scenes scattered throughout Claws of Awaji where Naoe learns more about her family. "[There's] a lot at the beginning with Nagato, a little bit with Tomiko, with Junjiro for sure. But the ending, we couldn't necessarily have a relationship. The mother is still not there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So [we said] 'let's bring in something personal to that character' — and it was also helpful to have it [set] after," Aresnault continued, referencing the fact that Claws of Awaji is chronologically set firmly as a coda to the main game, and cannot be played until after the credits have rolled. "And for Yasuke as well — if we had done it somewhere else in the story, well, Yasuke wouldn't have finished his own storyline, so he had not even talked to Naoe about his own mother."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We didn't know if there would be a second box or a third box or all the boxes"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Bordeaux wasn't necessarily always set to make this story, Arsenault revealed. Claws of Awaji's focus on the mysteries of Naoe's mother, and that third box, were both part of the discussions the studio had with Quebec as development began. For example, Bordeaux knew the expansion would introduce a new weapon to the game, but which it would be was not set in stone. (It's the Bo Staff, which all players will receive free whether they own Claws of Awaji or not.) As for Naoe's mother, did Bordeaux "have to make an expansion about her specifically?" Arsenault questioned. "Maybe not."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also sounds like there was some flux within Shadows' main storyline as development on it, and Claws of Awaji, both progressed. Fans have long wondered about Shadow's main macguffins, the three boxes ultimately said to contain the Japanese Imperial Regalia. Was it always the case that only two would be found in the main game, with a third left for the expansion?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It happened very fast," Aresnault replied. "It happened very fast, as soon as we started talking. If I remember correctly, because the game was still moving at that time, there was only one box total in the game, so we didn't know if there would be a second box or a third box or all the boxes. So they were still competing their own game. That's when we started talking about closing a little bit, the arc of the Regalia, that's when we started [saying], 'okay, well maybe we can bring in another box.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Bordeaux also decided to feature the returning character of Hattori Hanzo in Claws of Awaji as well, Arsenault continued. "That's when Hanzo came in, so yeah, it's a back and forth. Since the expansion is released kind of close to the release of the main game, both of them have to be produced at the same time in the timeline. Otherwise you don't ship this amount of content with this amount of quality."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this talk about Naoe's personal story, I was curious how Claws of Awaji would feature Yasuke. "So we focus his story more on — he still has a Templar hunt ongoing," Arsenault said, "but he's more in as a support role to Naoe emotionally at this point. He's kind of helping her go through what she's living." Where Naoe and Yasuke often had their own journeys in Shadows, they are "on one path together" in Claws of Awaji, Arsenault continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a story so closely tied into that of the base game, Claws of Awaji is being positioned as an experience that Assassin's Creed fans will want to return for. And after that — once my save file has reached at least 110 hours — will Bordeaux's expansion now provide a final finale? Or has it been tasked with passing Shadows' story baton on to yet anoher team?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying to make a closure for now, give Naoe a closure for her personal story," Arsenault concluded. "You can always reopen things, we've seen TV shows do it, we've seen movies do it. It's easy to do. So there's nothing closing the door completely. But we can expect at least to have proper closure to Naoe's story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the expansion, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-knows-youve-already-played-100-hours-of-assassins-creed-shadows-but-hopes-you-return-for-claws-of-awaji-to-play-the-expansions-cool-metal-gear-solid-inspired-stealth-boss-fight">IGN's report on Claws of Awaji's Metal Gear Solid-inspired stealth boss fight</a>, and Arsenault's thoughts on keeping players entertained with fresh ideas, even 100 hours of gameplay later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">"After 50, 70, 100 hours, you need something a bit unique," says Simon Arsenault, content director for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> expansion Claws of Awaji at Ubisoft Bordeaux. And it's true to say that — despite much of the upcoming add-on feeling familiar — Awaji still contains just enough distinct moments that the portion of its additional 10 hours we've now played felt fresh enough, rather than only offering more of the same. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is keen to showcase more of these distinct moments individually, and also keep some surprises back for players at launch, when the expansion arrives next week on September 16. But for now, IGN is able to highlight a cool Metal Gear Solid-inspired boss fight that doubles down on the series' focus on stealth, and is a highlight of the expansion's first half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in an atmospheric arena deep within Awaji's dense forest, players are tasked with repeatedly tracking down Awaki, one of the expansion's four main villains. Awaki is a master of stealth and disguise, and near-indistinguishable from a set of straw decoys also spread around the area. To counter her, you'll have to scuttle, sneak and crawl while staying out of sight, or risk getting sniped from long range by Awaki, who's equipped with a teppo rifle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Every time you're discovered, or mistakenly attack a decoy, Awaki changes her position — forcing you to start your hunt afresh. The only clues you're given are an ability to focus in on her voice whenever she taunts you, affording you a sense of direction, and the ability to use Naoe's Eagle Vision when in very close range, in order to confirm your suspicions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a relatively elaborate set-piece and something quite unlike anything else in Assassin's Creed — though stealth genre fans will find it somewhat similar to showdowns seen elsewhere. Indeed, while on a tour of Bordeaux's studio, developers acknowledged to IGN that the mission was inspired by Metal Gear Solid 3's The Fear fight, as well Dishonored, and Snake's MGS5 showdown with Quiet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fight also plays into Awaji's more isolated island setting , and the darker, creepier atmosphere the expansion hopes to differentiate itself with. "We really liked the idea of an island region, with natural boundaries all around, it's compact, there's a seclusion we like, something where you're a bit isoloted," Arsenault notes. "It brings increased tension to the experience, increased danger. As soon as we added a new faction in there, it's their world. As players you're coming into their land. You're not in control anymore, not as much."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/acsh-coa-screenshot-nowaki-10-09-2025-6pm-cest-1757435099439.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Claws of Awaji's stealth boss Awaki.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Awaji's quartet of antagonists embody much of that tension, and always seem one step ahead of Naoe and Yasuke as they search for answers regarding the former's mother, and hunt for Shadows' final mystery box macguffin. Standing in their way are Kimura Yukari, the daughter of a Templar Yasuke previously killed, her bodyguard Imagawa Tomeji, their spymaster Yasuhira, and lastly Nowaki — she's the cloaked character in a horned mask, above. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of these characters look set to have their own unique boss encounter, and it's these — alongside smaller tweaks to Shadows' main gameplay, the expansion's new weapon (the Bo staff), and a smattering of extra skills and abilities for existing play styles that Arsenault is hoping will keep players further entertained. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not as much countering it, it's more kind of spinning it," he tells me, when I ask about disrupting player expectations. "So you're expecting something and it doesn't behave the same way." I mention to him how, when going hands-on with the expansion, I sent out scouts to determine a mission's location as usual — only to discover a new gameplay system in Awaji where doing so alerts the local populace, making them antagonistic when you arrive. It's a new trade-off to using an existing system, and something Arsenault hopes will give veteran players something else to consider. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What should I do? Should I find a new strategy? Should I avoid sending scouts or should I send them somewhere else? That's what's interesting with it," he continued. "You take something that has been learned and has become kind of a routine and you just add a small twist. And we did that with a lot of systems. You're used to civilians [needing help], or merchants, but now some can attack you — that didn't happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For much more on the expansion's story, IGN sat down with Arsenault for an in-depth discussion detailing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-finally-wrap-up-2-key-storylines-in-its-claws-of-awaji-expansion-even-if-yasuke-is-now-taking-on-a-support-role">how Claws of Awaji picks up from Assassin's Creed Shadows' finale</a> and, finally, answers the game's two major narrative threads — even as various story elements shifted during development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
