<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature a new feature to weapon builds that makes it easier than ever to share loadouts with friends and other players.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, continues the trend of having highly customizable weapons, with adjustments impacting everything from fire rate to range.</p>



<p>Finding the perfect build has always been tricky, requiring players to copy a loadout piece by piece in the past, but that is changing with Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-loadout-sharing-codes">Black Ops 7 Loadout Sharing Codes</h2>

<p>In Black Ops 7, created loadouts will now feature a code that can be shared with other players, which they can then input in their game to copy the design instantly—meaning no more awkwardly fiddling through the options to find the right attachment.</p>



<p>The feature was revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, announcing that players can share or import Weapon Build Codes to try out loadouts with ease—and while the post says to try friends’ designs, it’s more than likely going to be used to copy creator designs or loadouts that appear on websites like ours or TikTok.</p>



<p>However, it’s unknown what will happen if you input a code that includes attachments you haven’t unlocked yet and whether the loadout will be blocked, or if it can be saved for later.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has also confirmed the return of Weapon Prestige, said to be the “deepest and most rewarding” system yet, awarding Prestige Attachments and Weapon Camos.</p>



<p>More details will be shared in the coming months, with a full multiplayer reveal scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 30’s COD Next showcase</a>, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-reveal-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into Zombies is due in early September</a>.</p>



<p>How much easier is this feature going to make building weapon loadouts in Black Ops 7? Let us know your thoughts in the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kirby has the ability to put everyone in a good mood, right? I mean, I've been in a lovely mood thanks to the pink puffball (and Nintendo), as I was lucky enough to go hands-on with the upcoming racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.</p>
<p>As a surprising sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on the GameCube, it's a really fascinating game, and it does, as director Masahiro Sakurai said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>, feel very different to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. So let me run you through what I got to play during my behind-closed-doors session.</p>
<p>I, along with around 20 or so other people, were all shuffled into a room together where, to my surprise, we got to watch the Direct together. Here is where I started really falling for this game. This was the first time we'd seen any gameplay, and it looked great. But the way Sakurai presents and goes into so much detail is what really did it for me.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/506543d4217a3/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not a picture of me winning... but I did win! — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right after the Direct, I got to go hands-on with the game, where I started off with some Lessons covering how to boost dash, drift, fly, land, capture enemies, etc. I only got to try a handful of these (through numbers three to nine) but these were really nice and helped me get to grips with the controls and movement.</p>
<p>If you've played Kirby Air Ride before, then you'll be familiar with the controls, but I haven't. The GameCube game only came out a year after I was born <em>(Ouch, I feel my back creaking... Ed~)</em>; of course, I could have gone back and played it (though it's <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Kirby-Air-Ride-Video-Games/139973/bn_7368608?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">not exactly the cheapest game</a>), but I was never really intrigued to check it out. However, now the new one is on the way? My goodness.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had to learn how to turn, which sounds a bit silly, but in Kirby Air Riders and its predecessor, you don't need to accelerate with the 'A' button, you just... <em>go</em>. So that took some getting used to. In the original game, you only used one button for everything, including to stop so you could turn your vehicle (called machines) around and then boost ahead. But in Air Riders, the devs have added a second button — yes, very exciting — which allows your racer to use their Special move.</p>
<p>Learning all of this didn't take very long, and I also found out by tilting the left stick side-to-side, you can do a spin attack and ram into other opponents. You can even inhale other characters and copy them. There's <em>a lot</em> of stuff going on.</p>
<p>After Lessons, we were all thrown into two regular races in Air Ride mode. I got to race on Floral Fields and Wave Flow Waters and I was really impressed by both courses. I tried out some different combos of characters and machines, too. For one of the pairings, my turns were really slow but had good speed otherwise, plus my character had an excellent special which helped me win the second race, even though we were playing with bots.</p>

<p>That all changed when we dived into City Trial, the big, meaty event for Kirby Air Riders. Here, we got to play three times and we were against three other people. This was a hugely popular mode in the original game, but here, it's been fleshed out and improved massively. In Air Riders, for example, you can simply switch karts seamlessly driving into them and pressing 'Y' rather than jumping off one and on another, and you get little suggestions on the screen that tell you what you might want to do next. And, at the end of a City Trial session, you all get to vote on the final minigame which you're all building up to.</p>
<p><em>'But wait, Felix, building up? Changing karts? What are you talking about?'</em> Well, in City Trial, you're driving around on this big island called Skyah, and it is <em>really</em> big, and you need to find a vehicle to upgrade to from your basic Warp Star. Then you drive around and collect all sorts of different power-ups — you can increase speed, air-time, boost your attack, defense, there are so many things to collect.</p>
<p>While I was collecting these upgrades and messing around, I discovered something that Sakurai also briefly stumbled upon during the Direct, a sort of glass-looking satellite in the sky which I thought was really cool. Not only are there secrets to find, but there are also multiple events taking place on the map too like big spiky balls falling from the sky, Kracko making an appearance, or a quick race where the winner in first-place will win lots of power-ups.</p>

<p>All of this is meant to get you to build the best possible vehicle for the final minigame in the Stadium. This can be a handful of options from Air Rider, which tests you on who can fly the farthest, or it can be a big brawl in Dustup Derby. It can even be a Gourmet Race, which tasks you with eating the most food. It's all really varied and exciting.</p>
<p>I think my biggest issue with City Trial is that you have five-minutes to go and collect all these power-ups, which to me is a little bit too long. Now it looks like there's lots of customisation in this game, so I'm hoping that means we can change or lower the time. It might be better when you're playing with 16 real people, but it felt a little anticlimactic when I played with just three others as, when we got to the final challenge, because we each voted on different minigames every time, we'd end up racing CPU-controlled rivals. We did eventually team up and vote for the same challenge for the last one, and , well, I actually won that one!</p>

<p>Another problem I had was that sometimes you can go <em>so fast</em> that it's hard to even know what's happening on the screen. Maybe it's my fault for aiming for the quickest stats, but this is where I started to experience a little bit of motion sickness. Now, you know I've also struggled with this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but with Kirby, it's not only me as one of the Nintendo representatives said that they actually got motion sickness playing the game, too.</p>
<p>It also might have to do with the fact we were sitting really close to a big TV (they were close together and we were advised to sit back if we could, which I did) so our whole depth-of-field was just Kirby Air Riders at maximum speed going left and right. So I'll have to see how I cope when the game launches.</p>
<p>There's a lot we still haven't seen, but even this early on, there's so much variety. In the character roster, for instance, not only are there many cool and weird picks like Susie (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kirby_planet_robobot">Planet Robobot</a>) and Gooey (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kirbys_dream_land_2">Kirby's Dream Land 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/kirbys_dream_land_3">3</a>) but they all have multiple costumes. Kirby comes in pink, yellow, purple, and one other colour, while King Dedede has his standard red robes alongside a blue robe and a pink one. Some only have two, while Kirby has the most at four (for now). I also really love that <em>all</em> of the characters, not just Kirby, can copy abilities, this alone makes it feel different than Mario Kart, and I can't wait to see what Meta Knight looks like holding a microphone.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm worried that City Trial will get old and I think it's a little odd that the final minigame splits your group of 16 into four different groups — there's the option to vote for a random challenge, which will then just throw you into a random minigame or group at the end, so I think the voting system is the best solution we have right now for variety. On the whole, though, I enjoyed Air Ride mode the most because I felt the adrenaline rush more.</p>
<p>Graphically and musically, however, this game is fantastically phenomenal, it's got that Sakurai magic. The colours pop, the animations are bold and expressive, and the orchestral songs and remixes are all brilliant. The sparkling, explosions, and all the other sound effects really help bring everything together.</p>
<p>So, in case you case you couldn't tell, I think that Kirby Air Riders is shaping up to be really great. I had a really nice time racing with others and the controls feel extremely natural and easy to learn. Kirby is having a heck of a year on Switch 2, I can't wait to see more of this game when it launches on 20th November 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Fans Notice Change in Season Two Trailer That Retcons a Piece of New Vegas]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-two-trailer-change-retcon-new-vegas/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-fans-notice-change-in-season-two-trailer-that-retcons-a-piece-of-new-vegas.1275240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The award-winning, live-action adaptation of Fallout has a new season debuting in December. Last night, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, a brand-new trailer was revealed by the cast, revealing a couple of minutes of the next season. It was a wild ride that unveiled the New Vegas wasteland, uncovering key tales for the road ahead.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed Fallout fans (including myself) noticed a very obvious change that some feel might be an error, while others believe it’s merely the team taking some creative license with the show.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-dinky">What Happened to Dinky?</h2>



<p>In Fallout: New Vegas (2010), players will inevitably head to Novac, a settlement built around an old motel. Flanking that motel is a towering Tyrannosaurus Rex statue affectionately named ‘Dinky’. Players will eventually link up with Boone, a marksman who sits in the mouth of the dinosaur, using his head as a sniper’s nest.</p>



<p>In the Fallout season two trailer, we see Novac and Dinky more than once, but something <strong>is different</strong>.</p>



<p>As one shot reveals, Dinky has been <strong>flipped </strong>and is now facing the ‘wrong way’. In the 2010 game, Dinky is looking out over the wasteland with his back to Novac, but in the trailer for season two, he’s facing inwards and looming over the motel. This means that the sniper’s nest has a clear line of sight into the motel, rather than away from it.</p>



<p>This isn’t an enormous change, but it invalidates a portion of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout Season 2 - Official Teaser Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZY5WiqeyQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>For those not aware, the player links up with Boone in New Vegas and follows a path that sees Boone get revenge against those who sold his wife into slavery. Boone asks the player to lead the key suspect away from Novac and into the line of sight of Dinky and the sniper’s nest, with Boone exacting a portion of his revenge from afar.</p>



<p>Again, it’s not a massive change, but it’s enough that fans are questioning it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last month, Dredge developer Black Salt Games announced its second studio called Disc 2 Games, and now the first project from this new studio has been announced. Canvas City is a turn based RPG where roller skates and graffiti tags are the implements of choice to gain victory over rivals. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer, which provides a look at tagging and battling.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Unlisted] Canvas City - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eo40fiREHzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Movement isn’t just getting from one spot to another, it’s part of the plan”</em>&nbsp;explains Technical Director Kris Nicholson.&nbsp;<em>“Chaining tricks and attacks mid-turn changes how you think about positioning and opens up new ways to win.”</em></p>
<p>In Canvas City, battles take place between rival crews with each one having their own goals. Some of these crews are backed by corporations while others are freestylers trying to claim the streets back from an oppressive regime. Players can recruit up to 12 different skaters, each with their own skill sets to take on the different crews and aim to beat them to progress in the story. The gameplay of Canvas City does not just consist of attacking enemy crew members though. To power up abilities, characters need to pull off tricks and attack to build up Style Points. These style points are then used to activate more powerful abilities. As you progress through the game new upgrades will be unlocked to make your crew more powerful, allowing them to take on the tougher challenges that will come their way.</p>

<p>Canvas City is due to be released for PC and Nintendo Switch, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

As if the trailer wasn’t enough, The Traveler made a dramatic appearance on stage in full cosplay—stepping out of the void and into the spotlight, blurring the line between the game and reality.</p><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is a third-person survival horror game developed by the renowned horror studio Bloober Team, best known for the critically acclaimed <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill 2 (2024) [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-2-2024">Silent Hill 2</a></em> remake.</p><p>The game is built around a powerful, original narrative that unfolds in New Dawn – an abstract reinterpretation of the real Nowa Huta district in Kraków, Poland. The story is told across two contrasting timelines: a post-apocalyptic future and the gritty industrial reality of the 1980s. This unique setting blends retro realism with dystopian science-fiction and a retro futuristic atmosphere, creating a deeply immersive world filled with tension, mystery, and psychological depth.</p><p>At this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live, a stunning new cinematic trailer premiered on the main stage—featuring a surprise appearance by none other than The Traveler.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer immerses us in the haunting ruins of New Dawn, beginning with a mysterious sequence that follows the movements of a cat through the desolate landscape. From there, it transitions into cinematic shots of The Traveler – the game’s central figure—whose journey we’ll follow throughout the game. We’re shown gripping, high-stakes encounters as The Traveler faces off against The Orphans—terrifying creatures that haunt this broken world. All of this plays out against the haunting soundtrack of “Sixteen Days / Gathering Dust” by This Mortal Coil, heightening the sense of mystery and atmosphere.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,160 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,725 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [334 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on September 5.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

<p>Although Bethesda and its developers are now under the control of Microsoft and Xbox, games from its teams are still expected to show up on other platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Zombies mode will be getting its big reveal soon enough. After showcasing the game’s co-op campaign and a hint of Multiplayer, Zombies got a small section of the trailer. Still, for those who want to know more, you won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is returning to the cybernetic world of Black Ops 2. While the campaign picks up David Mason’s story, fans are no doubt excited for Multiplayer and Zombies. We previously reported that Multiplayer will be at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">COD Next</a>, as well as Zombies. However, it looks like it may be sooner than that, thanks to confirmation from PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-zombies-return-in-a-big-way-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Zombies Return (in a Big Way) in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>At around <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=132">the 2:12 mark</a> of the latest trailer of Black Ops 7, a peek at Zombies is shown. We get a few seconds of gameplay, as well as an interesting arcade mode called Dead Ops Arcade 4. It’s not much, though it was confirmed that, alongside Multiplayer, it will be present at COD Next. The event, which takes place on September 30th, 2025, plans to show off both modes in detail. However, it looks like we may see Zombies earlier than that, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/">PlayStation Blog</a> mentions an early September reveal for the mode.</p>



<p>From the Call of Duty blog, Black Ops 7’s Zombies picks off where Black Ops 6 left off, with the crew now meeting the original Black Ops Zombies members. The mode will apparently be its biggest yet, with the launch map being quite vast. For fans of Black Ops 2, Survival Maps return, so players can enjoy multiple maps to play on and last against the hordes of zombies. </p>



<p>While there isn’t a firm date as to when Black Ops 7 Zombies will be shown, it’ll be before COD Next. Given the game launches on Game Pass, you’ll be able to dive into Zombies day one if you own the subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s post-launch content, the newest story expansion, Legacy of the Forge, got a brand new trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Even more so, we now have a release date for it, and it’s quite soon.</p>



<p>Made by Warhorse Studios, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s immersive RPG gameplay improves over the original in many ways. Already being helmed as one of 2025’s best, the studio has been hard at work with post-launch content. It’s first, Brushes with Death, added new quests with an art-focused storyline, as well as shield customization. While one, Mysteria Ecclesiae, is still planned, the next one is Legacy of the Forge, which was shown off in a brand new trailer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcvB6lH-LKI">shown above</a>, Henry acts upon his late father’s legacy and starts using his old forge to craft new weapons for the folks of Kuttenberg. Legacy of the Forge, which releases on September 9th, 2025, will let players create new weapons and armor to use. Plus, new story content following Henry uncovering his father’s past will be added. In it, you’ll meet allies that may reveal another side to Henry’s father that he never knew.</p>



<p>In addition, players can now customize their own houses. You can personalize many aspects of your domicile, like your armory and bedroom. With over 100 million variations, there are no limits to your medieval imagination. All of the new content in Legacy of the Forge will cost $13.99 on all platforms, though Expansion Pass holders will get the DLC for free. </p>



<p>The success of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, given the original’s reception. Still, the game has become a top contender for award season, especially for RPGs and Direction. Fortunately, Legacy of the Forge and subsequent DLC will ensure it isn’t going anywhere, which fans will be more than happy about. </p>



<p>Will you play Legacy of the Forge when it comes out on September 9th? Did you enjoy Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Let us know in the comments below and in the forums!</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is getting a COD Next all about it in late September. After getting its gameplay reveal at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Activision has announced when we’ll see more. Fortunately, it won’t be long before we see more Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, 2025, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/">brings the series back</a> to the Mason family, specifically David Mason. In 2035, he and his crew are taken into a warped reality thanks to Black Ops 2’s Raul Menendez. Going off of Black Ops 6 ‘s success last year, Raven and Treyarch aren’t pulling punches, as the new COD Next is weeks away.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-cod-next-streams-on-september-30th-2025">Black Ops 7’s COD Next Streams on September 30th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s been announced that the next COD Next will livestream on September 30th, 2025. No exact timing or platforms are available as of writing. In it, fans will get a look at Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, which <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=126">was teased</a> in the trailer above. COD Next also plans to have famous content creators try out the new Multiplayer and Zombies modes live. Then, on October 2nd, a beta will occur for fans to finally get their hands on it at home. </p>



<p>Despite releasing a bit later than most Call of Duty’s do, Black Ops 7 looks to be another fun futuristic take on the series. While the co-op campaign might turn some solo players off, there’s no doubt that it’ll sell quite well. Even more so, it will launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass, meaning more people than ever can play. All that said, COD Next is an event many should keep tabs on, especially since Multiplayer is the series’ bread and butter. </p>

<p>Microsoft is bringing Starfield to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, known leaker Nate The Hate said that Starfield will be making its way to Nintendo’s latest console along with the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>“Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5… Starfield is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was confirmed</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 during Gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday. No set date was announced for the game on the system aside from it being next year.</p>



<p>Going back to Starfield, right now the only information is from Nate The Hate’s initial tweet. It’s unknown if the game will launce with the Shattered Space expansion or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even the anticipated second</a> expansion. A new expansion, if rumors are to be believed, is expected to come in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>A potential release on the Switch 2 isn’t the only Starfield news to be making the rounds. Recently, a data mine suggested that real-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-datamine-suggests-a-new-ship-feature-is-on-the-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interplanetary travel could be coming</a> in a future update.</p>



<p>What do you think of Starfield possibly coming to Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamescom Opening Night Live took place earlier today, and like I've done every show since leaving My Old Job, I didn't watch it.<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> You didn't need to watch it either</a>. If you <em>did</em>, though, or are only now catching up on some of the reveals, have you ever wondered how much it costs to get a game in front of that many eyeballs at the same time?</p><p>As<a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we've learned from Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest</a>, these things don't come cheap! In Gamescom 2025's case (thanks to Christopher Kassulke<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christopherkassulke_gamescom-onl-gamesindustry-activity-7363542070583521280-nvBy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> for first posting these</a>),<a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> prices</a> ranged from a downright affordable (RELATIVE) €70,500 (USD$82,000) for a 30-second spot in the pre-show, and went all the way up to €465,000 (or USD$520,000 at time of publishing) for 180 seconds in the main event.</p><p>Here's the full breakdown:</p><blockquote><h3>ONL Pre Show</h3><p>30 Sec - 70,500.00 EUR</p><p>60 Sec - 102,500.00 EUR</p><p>90 Sec - 135,000.00 EUR</p><p>120 Sec - 167,500.00 EUR</p><p>150 Sec - 200,000.00 EUR</p><p>180 Sec - 232,500.00 EUR</p><h3>ONL Main Show</h3><p>30 Sec - 140,000.00 EUR</p><p>60 Sec - 205,000.00 EUR</p><p>90 Sec - 270,000.00 EUR</p><p>120 Sec - 335,000.00 EUR</p><p>150 Sec - 400,000.00 EUR</p><p>180 Sec - 465,000.00 EUR</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Note that not <em>every </em>trailer making up the show was paid for like this. Again, like Summer Game Fest, access to the showcase could come via one of two ways: a "sponsorship" slot, which is paying the prices above, or as an "editorial" slot, which were reserved for "brand new game announcements and breaking game news to drive awareness/audience during the livestream", and which came "without additional costs". </p><p>For those that did spend, that's a <em>lot </em>of money. Especially when you consider a lot of these bigger companies aren't just stumping up for a trailer or two, but for<a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/info/exhibitors/exhibit/pricing-and-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> booths</a> and other deals (<a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/exhibitor/gamescom-sponsorships.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like €75,000 for an 'event module'</a>) across the multiple days.</p><p>Hope it was worth it! And by worth it I mean that for over half a million dollars you got your trailer near the <em>top</em> of a website's "ALL THE STUFF WE SAW AT GAMESCOM OPENING NIGHT LIVE" blog, and not buried somewhere near the bottom.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

If you're a fan of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series, either the games or the TV show, you can now preorder a replica of Ellie's guitar that Joel customized with the custom moth inlay fretboard.

You can preorder it for $2,999.99 at the PlayStation Store and it will officially release on November 18, 2025. It's listed in the PlayStation store's hardware section among various consoles, controllers, and other accessories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h2><div catalogid="09a8041f-5e7d-4130-8508-ecf1bff3e86c" id="227110"><div id="227110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The PlayStaton Store bundle includes a strap and replica case.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar has distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top in Sitka spruce pulled straight from the game and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">latest season of the TV show</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think that $3,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a guitar, it's actually not <em>that</em> terribly priced, especially for a nice acoustic guitar.

But what about new games and episodes of the show? Game-wise, The Last of Us Part 3 has yet to be officially confirmed and it seems unlikely that it ever will be.

						<h5>Echoes of the End</h5><p><span>August 12, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Echoes of the End is the debut title from developer Myrkur Games and is published by Deep Silver. At first glance, at least based on the title, it looks like it has something new to offer, or at least familiar but in a comforting way. But before the tutorial was even over, I was deeply concerned with how negative the familiarity felt, in a way that made it difficult not to compare it to its betters.</p>



<p>By the end, however, Echoes of the End pulled together a story and even a few gameplay moments that were meaningful to experience, but not so meaningful that it's worth crawling through a boring first half to get to an improved back-half, especially when there are elements that never really improve.</p>



<p>Echoes of the End puts you in the shoes of Ryn, who is also a vestige, a person who has the potential for incredibly destructive power, and who is so dangerous to others around them that they can't even touch another person. Right from the top, when Ryn is surveilling an area with her brother Cor, she denies grabbing his hand to help her up a cliff, and Cor refers back to a previous incident where Ryn gave Cor scars because of her powers. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End features plenty of stunning vistas.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The more we learn about what it means to be a vestige from Ryn, the more we discover that Ryn has basically been told she's something to be feared all her life. It's pretty much all that defines Ryn as a character. She's scared of her power and is seemingly angry at herself all the time for even having it. She only seems to be able to make peace with herself by using her strength to fight against the threats that her countrymen, and more specifically her brother, cannot overcome alone. </p>



<p>But just as we're getting to know more about her relationship with Cor, who is perhaps the only person that Ryn can be comfortable with, he's kidnapped by the game's antagonists, Aurick, the leader of an opposing nation's invading force, and Zara, a vestige who is using her powers to try and destroy the magical protection wards that have kept Ryn and Cor's nation safe for years.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ryn and Abram discover the invasion is progressing faster than they could have anticipated.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fact that Zara is succeeding at destroying the wards is cause for concern, but not so concerning that Ryn thinks twice about throwing herself into a fight with Aurick, Zara, and their legions. It's at this early point in the game that we are introduced to Abram, a scholar who was traveling to Ryn's homeland to figure out what happened to Ryn's father, as he was, unbeknownst to Ryn, pen pals with her late dad, and became worried when the letters stopped coming. That's at least what Abram tells you at the beginning, but you don't have to be a scholar to figure out that there's more to his character than he's letting on.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Deep Silver</figcaption></figure>



<p>You soon learn that Abram lost his daughter several years ago, and with that knowledge the fractured parent-child relationship that Abram and Ryn each represent one side of that will be healed over the course of the game's events, reveals itself in the narrative. Abram is a parent looking to fill the gap left by his lost child, and Ryn is searching for a father to give her the kind of compassion she believes she never got.</p>



<p>That at least sets the groundwork for what becomes a bit more of an interesting character-driven story by the end of the game, no more of which I'll spoil here, though even with what I've already shared, you might be able to predict how it ends. And that's part of the problem I keep swinging back and forth on with Echoes of the End.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Some of my favorite moments in Echoes of the End were the conversations between Ryn and Abram while they looked out at the skyline.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Its narrative is very familiar, because its themes, and even the look of its setting, can't help but resemble another recent series of games that have a similar visual language and character explorations, which, if you haven't yet guessed, is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-mad-dad-redemption/">2018 God of War reboot</a>. Is Echoes of the End bad because it is predictable, and in a post-2018 God of War world, tries to execute its own spin on what Sony Santa Monica proved was a winning formula? Not necessarily, but it's also not good because of it. It might be a comforting, C-grade story by the end that has a few B-grade moments and even one A-grade moment before the credits roll. But it misses the mark more than it hits it, and it only starts getting close to the target once you've reached the fifth chapter and are officially in the back half of a 10-chapter game.</p>



<p>You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the gameplay yet. That's because I'm trying to talk more about the good, or at least the half-good elements to find in Echoes of the End, before getting into the bad and the janky. </p>



<figure><figcaption>This forgotten king is perhaps the best boss fight in Echoes of the End.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, sticking with the good, and with the story for a bit more, I'd be remiss if I didn't compliment the voice acting, which was perhaps the main reason I came around to Ryn and Abram even before the story got more interesting in the latter parts of the game. </p>



<p>The gameplay elements that fall into that 'good' descriptor are its puzzle and platforming mechanics, but again, these only get interesting towards the back half of the game. Even worse for a puzzle game fan like myself, some of the more interesting puzzle mechanics are introduced in one chapter, never to be seen again. Some puzzle elements are layered on top of each other in the final chapters to make for the game's most fun-to-solve challenges, but they're so few that it feels more disappointing than anything, because I can't help wondering why they didn't explore more layering between the puzzles and platforming.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End has a few fun puzzles.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I can appreciate that those puzzles and platforming sections in the latter half of the game were included at all, but I walked away from my time with Echoes of the End wondering why the ramp-up to those challenges was so poor. I'm also left wondering, and bemoaning, how quickly the game was prepared to give me the answer. At least Echoes of the End had the courtesy to let me press a button to ask for a hint, and I only recall a few times in the early part of the game where my companion, whether it was Cor or Abram, spilled the beans on what to do before I even had time to begin figuring out the puzzle in front of me. As a side note, achievement hunters would do well to avoid the hint button, since there are several puzzles where you'll get an achievement for solving them without any help from the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This volcano level was a favorite of mine, especially visually.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The final point in the 'good' category, I can't deny that Echoes of the End is easy on the eyes across all 10 chapters. Some, like the chapter that takes place entirely in a volcano, and the one on a frozen lake with a Northern Lights-esque skybox all around you, are more engaging to stop and marvel at than others, but overall this is game is a visual treat, especially if you have a PC that can really push the graphical limits of a modern release.</p>



<p>With 'the good' unfortunately exhausted, it's time for the bad, and the bad is the combat. I found it entirely unengaging, lacking in enemy variety, and thanks to the jank that was constantly present in all aspects of the game, it was difficult, if not impossible, to get into any flow with Ryn and her movements across each encounter, boss fights included. A key element of this is the game's poor lock-on function, which could very well just be broken, so you might find this review a year after this game's launch and have no idea what I'm talking about because Myrkur Games patched it up. But as it currently stands, the lock-on doesn't seem to really work, and I was fighting the camera as much as I was fighting the barrage of lackluster humanoid enemies in front of me.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Deep Silver</figcaption></figure>



<p>Any flow to the combat that could be found came from stunning enemies with your powers to slam them into each other, or inflict damage with several other mana-based attacks while you picked them off, because the enemy AI possessed no thought other than 'charge at player character' when in a fight. It got boring quickly, even if parrying made me feel overpowered from the start without levelling up, and some of the final-blow animations that played when I defeated the last enemy in an encounter were occasionally cool to look at. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End's more interesting encounters are, unfortunately, too few.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the skill tree you'll progress through did very little to add spice to the combat, and honestly, while it might've been an early judgment, I sort of figured that would be the case when I saw the first upgrade you unlock is your bog-standard Heavy Attack. Maybe this is reductive, but if you're gating any aspect of my character's combat progression with a mechanic that comes as part of the default package in any number of third-person action games, that signifies a shallow combat system in my eyes.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End's lock-on system is unfortunately broken.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Credit where it's due, some of the very final skills you earn in the tree make it a little more fun to toss enemies around, but there's nothing in Echoes of the End's combat that makes me excited to get to the next enemy encounter or boss fight. I was instead left thankful when one ended, because at least I might get an interesting narrative scene afterwards, or a fun puzzle to solve.</p>



<p>Finally, the janky, which, surprise surprise, runs through every element in Echoes of the End. It's perhaps even a meme at this point, but this is yet again an Unreal Engine 5 release that is a poor technical showcase at launch that's doing its best to distract you from the hitches, texture pop-ins, stutters, frame rate drops, and everything else under the sun short of the game crashing. I played pretty much all of my 15-hour playthrough on my laptop, which sports a Ryzen 9 6900HS and a mobile NVIDIA RTX 3070Ti, at 1440p at Medium settings, and even dropping the graphical preset to Low didn't solve my issues.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End does have better character moments towards the end.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Frankly, by the end of my playthrough, Echoes of the End felt like I was playing something that launched in the mid-to-late-2000s as a seventh-generation console release. That can have its own brand of charm, if, like me, you were going through some of your more formative gaming years at the time, but that doesn't mean it's worth spending your money on. Also, that charm wore off whenever an invisible projectile hit me in the middle of an attack animation. It almost didn't matter that I could parry them later on in the game, since I couldn't see them coming in the first place.</p>



<p>And invisible flaming rocks are just the tip of the iceberg for the constant glitches I was fighting beyond the enemies in front of me. At least when I stopped to look at the scenery, which was so often that most of my screenshots are stills of Ryn staring into the horizon, it was nice to look at.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Echoes of the End delivers a C-grade experience that's trying to be flashy enough for an A. It may be visually appealing, and the back half of the game's narrative might have some solid character moments, but the technical issues and the seventh-generation-esque jank run the whole experience down.  </p>



<p>The combat, unfortunately, never lifts it back up, with rote gameplay that doesn't try to be innovative, and doesn't get the tried-and-true elements right either. The few fun and intriguing platforming and puzzle sections, along with a story that is able to stick its landing, aren't enough to save it, in part because it's questionable if it is worth sticking around to see those parts, when you could spend your time, and money, playing something that doesn't take half of its runtime to get interesting. I can appreciate that this is a small team's debut game that they put a lot of heart into, but that doesn't excuse how lacking the overall package is.</p>

					<h2>Echoes of the End</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Echoes of the End has more bad than good to it, and the jank of its technical issues running throughout all aspects of the game bring down even its best elements, like its strong visual presentation, character-driven storytelling, and some fun platforming and puzzle challenges. The combat both overall fails to innovate and pass the standard bar for interesting, and as a whole package it's likely not worth your time when you need to get five-chapters deep in a 10-chapter story to get to its best bits.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Character-driven storytelling that sticks the landing by the end
</li><li>Strong visual presentation that's great to look at throughout
</li><li>A few fun puzzle and platforming challenges, particularly towards the back half</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>It puts its worst foot forward and takes five chapters into a 10-chapter game to get better
</li><li>Fraught with technical issues that bring down even its better elements
</li><li>Combat that both doesn't try to innovate and isn't able to stand up with modern action-adventure standards
</li><li>Lack of enemy variety that, once again doesn't improve until later chapters
</li><li>Uninteresting boss fights that are more often than not repeat fights against the same key characters</li>						</ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> developers Jyamma Games are making a new action-RPG inspired by and named after Dante Alighieri’s 14th century epic poem La Divina Commedia, aka the Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>Like the poem, it sees you descending through the circles of Hell, each the geological manifestation of a particular Sin. Unlike the poem, it features a set of combat classes, a choice of protagonist genders, a narrative alignment system, procedurally generated extraction dungeons, and customisable weapons and armour. As the poet himself might say: in the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself within a dark wood where I had to grind for crafting materials. </p><!--more-->
<p>The games industry has not been mega gentle with poor old Dante, whose monumental work helped establish the Tuscan language and influenced a brace of English writers, from Blake to Beckett. The best-known video game adaptation is probably still Visceral’s cheeseball 2010 action-adventure Dante’s Inferno, which is often more interested in aping God Of War. A cynical man or snob (hello!) might look at the below, hacky-slashy trailer for Jyamma’s adaptation and consider it to be another act of wanton literary desecration. Terza rima isn’t supposed to be a three-hit combo, you blistering philistines!</p>

<p>Still, this isn't quite another exercise in crafting boobwalls for the circle of Lust or punching organs out of bodies. Enotria was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enotria-the-last-song-review%E2%80%9D">pretty metaphysical for a Soulslike</a>, building a universe and combat system around the practice of stagecraft, and Jyamma’s take on the La Divina Commedia is similarly dreamy - it turns Dante’s poem into a kind of overarching mythology.</p><p>“In this new adventure, the studio presents an epic journey set in a world where The Divine Comedy has supplanted the old faith, bringing about a golden age of righteousness among humanity,” explains <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/JYAMMA-GAMES-ANNOUNCES-LA-DIVINA-COMMEDIA-AN-EPIC-DARK-FANTASY-ACTION-">a press release</a>. “When dark forces subvert the promises of the poem, order collapses and the world is thrust into chaos. The player will take on the role of a warrior-poet trapped in the infernal depths, called to descend through the circles of Hell, face increasingly powerful demons, and redeem a sinful past.”</p>
<p>Sounds quite involved. Still, I’m not sure where the procgen extraction dungeons fit in, exactly. The idea of mining hell for loot and progression materials is the kind of videogame conceit I’d love to lay before an actual 14th century theologian. I'm sure the humour of the situation would be well worth the inconvenience of being burned at the stake. Anyway, there’s no release date yet for La Divina Commedia. The poem took about 12 years to write – hopefully, Jyamma will turn their version around a little sooner.</p>

              <p>Raphaël “Jeanpormanove” Graven reportedly died in his sleep earlier this week following broadcasts <a href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-kick-twitch-faze-clan-gambling-1850973704">on Kick</a> where he was routinely assaulted by others in controversial “humiliation” livestreams. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpjplk4pxo">According to the BBC</a>, a judicial investigation in France is underway, with French government minister for digital technologies Clara Chappaz calling what Graven experienced “absolute horror.”</p> <p>The death of the 46-year-old, whose <a href="https://www.charentelibre.fr/france/qui-etait-jean-pormanove-l-influenceur-decede-en-live-25595669.php">streaming career began with TikTok videos about <em>GTA 5 </em>and <em>FIFA</em></a> and who had amassed over a million followers across all his channels, appears to have been captured live during his latest, and last, marathon Kick broadcast. Graven’s more recent content, which he created as part of the collective Le LokalTV, included being seemingly brutalized by two fellow streamers who go by the aliases <span dir="auto">“Naruto”</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">“Safine,” with some clips appearing to show violent, prolonged strangulations. </span>An <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/080125/maltraitances-sur-kick-deux-influenceurs-nicois-places-en-garde-vue">investigation last year by<em> Mediapart</em></a> alleged that Graven had been subject to “months of online abuse.”</p> <p>It’s unclear what exactly the relationship was between all of the men, though reporting by <em>Mediapart</em> suggests the “humiliation” streams were lucrative and helped propel the popularity of Graven and the group’s channel on Kick. Naruto and Safine were reportedly taken into custody earlier this year but were later released amid an ongoing investigation. Kick also temporarily suspended the channel but it later resumed streaming again. Clips of the alleged abuse can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpactMediaFR/status/1957522649879302450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1957522649879302450%7Ctwgr%5E96e20f49e42b8d663ca62bac84c30551c2664a5b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fkick%2Ffrench-streamer-jean-pormanove-dies-in-his-sleep-age-46-3239700%2F">circulating online</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/180825/victime-de-maltraitance-en-ligne-depuis-des-mois-le-streamer-jean-pormanove-meurt-en-direct"><em>Mediapart</em> now reports</a> that viewers of the stream earlier this week on Discord became worried about Graven’s condition after he appeared to being laying motionless in his sleep for an extended period of time. According to <em>the AFP</em>, an autopsy to determine the cause of death has been ordered.</p> <p>Kick is a competitor to Twitch and YouTube known for its loose guidelines and minimal moderation. Streamers there can promote gambling and other topics that are prohibited on other streaming platforms. A representative for Kick told the BBC it was “urgently reviewing” the circumstances around Graven’s apparent death on camera. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeanpormanove and extend our condolences to his family, friends and community,” they said.</p>

              <p><em>Denshattack!</em> was probably the coolest game revealed during <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">today’s very long Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a>. But funnily enough, the wild-looking, trick-based anime train game wasn’t actually revealed during the trailer-packed event. Instead, it debuted during ONL’s shockingly good pre-show. And I can’t wait to play it when it launches next year.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!’s </em>vibrant colors and eye-popping art immediately caught the attention of everyone at <em>Kotaku</em> and reminded me of <em>Jet Set Radio</em> or even Insomniac’s <em>Sunset Overdrive</em>. And then, we all saw a train do some flips and grinds, and suddenly it became clear that <em>Denshattack!</em>&nbsp;is like a<em> Tony Hawk</em> game, but instead of controlling a person on a skateboard, you control a customizable subway car that can flip, jump, grind, hop, spin, and more across some truly gorgeous scenery. Just watch this trailer and try not to smile.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Denshattack! - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_Xmv9eAIZA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s how the game’s developers, Undercoders, describe <em>Denshattack!:&nbsp;</em></p>

 <blockquote><p>Flip, trick, and grind your train in a fast-paced, off-the-rails ride through a colorful Japanese dystopia. Outmatch rival gangs, wreck a shady megacorp, and take back the tracks with nothing but skill, speed, and style. Hop aboard your custom gravity-defying train and embark on a hectic quest to defeat the sinister Miraido corporation, alongside a vibrant pack of outcasts.</p></blockquote> <p>According to the game’s trailer on YouTube, <em>Denshattack!</em> contains over 50 levels to complete, a full combo system, and “slick beats” from composer Tee Lopes, who helped create the music for games like <em>Sonic Mania </em>and <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge.&nbsp;</em>It also features “bizarre boss fights” and multiple regions of Japan to discover and explore while doing sick flips as a big train. This is definitely one of those video game concepts, <a href="https://kotaku.com/shark-dentist-horror-game-deadly-great-white-steam-pc-1851786072">like doing dental work on a shark</a>, that I never thought about, but now that I’ve seen it, I must play it as soon as possible.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!&nbsp;</em>doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but is set to launch in Spring 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand/" data-ref-id="5000-681582">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</a> is a first-person, narrative-driven mystery game developed by Friday Sundae. This is the studio's debut game, and a hands-on demo is available for those at Gamescom this week. I watched the demo ahead of its release at a preview event, and the game is an alluring combination of part-ghost story, part-musical, and part-renovation game. The heart of the game is the ghost story, though, and the developer works to make this spooky seaside tale approachable for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">In There Are No Ghosts at the Grand, you play as Chris David, a character who has inherited The Grand, a dilapidated hotel located along the English coast. Chris is initially only tasked with restoration of the hotel, but he is ultimately drawn into rooting out a deeper mystery that surrounds the town and the people who live there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552108" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552108"></a><figcaption>The Grand hotel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first part of the demo showcased the game's unique hotel renovation mechanics, which uses a quirky set of talking power tools built into one handheld device. Robert C. MacBrushy is a Scottish AI assistant integrated into this tool, and he gives a bit of humorous commentary to keep you company as you renovate the hotel. This sounds like it will come in handy to balance the tense elements of the game, as There Are No Ghosts at the Grand turns spooky at nighttime.</p><p dir="ltr">In the daytime, the game focuses on renovation work, with the handheld device hosting a selection of tools, including a sandblaster, power sprayer, turbo vacuum, and a furnisher. Anil Glendinning, Friday Sundae's creative director and co-founder who presented the demo, also confirmed each power-tool type has three different modes that are unlocked as you progress. We saw debris get sucked up in the device's turbo vacuum, and the demo also showed how intuitive the sprayer mechanic could be when painting walls. Glendinning said the game was designed to allow players to have fun renovating without requiring precision. With simple swipes of the sprayer, the game knew to paint only the wall surface and ignore the surrounding furniture and paintings that were still decorating the area.</p><p dir="ltr">At nighttime, the town gets a bit weird and spooky. A good example of this is when Chris's efforts to help the mayor leaves him stranded on an island. This seems to be the first moment of the game where he learns about the spooky dangers of the town, as he steps outside during a nighttime portion of the demo to find a bunch of red chairs scattered all around him. The chairs quickly evolved into some sort of spider-chair-monsters. This scare culminated in a chase scene and first-person-shooter moment, where the renovation multi-tool turned into a weapon that let Chris fire back at the creepy chair-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">"We describe the game as being spooky. But there's no gore in the game or horror-distressing elements," Glendinning said. "It doesn't need it in order to tell the story we want to tell. And that story is about people and family, and it's about how some of that stuff can manifest itself in life."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552115" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552115"></a><figcaption>The spider-chair-monsters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552109,1300-4552110,1300-4552111,1300-4552112,1300-4552113,1300-4552114" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is also a musical of sorts. Our preview introduced us to the town's mayor, who shared her feelings toward Chris and his hotel renovation plans through a musical number. During these scenes, you're given the option to choose how you want to respond to the characters, and Chris will sing his reply. These musical moments will happen with other characters you meet in the story as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The game wasn't always planned to be a musical, Glendinning said, but the element was added fairly early on.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very start, we wanted to create a ghost story," he said, explaining how the story was inspired by some of the dilapidated seaside towns and boarded-up shops found in the United Kingdom. "We were hearing this internal soundtrack in our heads as we were creating this ghost story, and as we were writing dialogue and setting it to music, the [musical] dialogue evolved from that."</p><p dir="ltr">These musical interactions are just some of the opportunities for branching narratives in the game. There are also multiple endings you can experience based on your non-musical interactions with the town folk, as well as how much information you learn about the town and your neighbors by exploring and uncovering clues.</p><p dir="ltr">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand extends beyond the hotel itself, as you get access to explore various parts of the seaside village. We saw part of a mission that began with a moped ride through town, and eventually, Chris was tasked with repairing a boat for a trip to a haunted island with a World War II bunker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552116" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552116"></a><figcaption>Mr. Bones and Robert C. MacBrushy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We weren't introduced to many characters, but we did meet Mr. Bones, a cat who lurks around the hotel and follows Chris on some adventures. Mr. Bones appears to be just a normal cat during the daylight hours, but at night he gains the ability to talk to Chris and speaks with an Australian accent. It's possible his story will be part of the mystery you'll need to uncover. Regardless, don't worry: The preview confirmed you can pet the cat.</p><p dir="ltr">Glendinning also confirmed various parts of the game can be skipped.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're believers in allowing players to move through the story," he said. "If a puzzle is too difficult, you can definitely skip it."</p><p dir="ltr">That also factors into the game's replayability, as you can skip scenes and puzzles you've already experienced to more quickly advance through additional playthroughs.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, the early preview piqued my interest, as someone who loves musicals and a good mystery. The town looks cozy yet mysterious, and characters like Mr. Bones and Robert C. MacBrushy lend a great deal of personality to the game, leaving me eager to play and uncover the secrets of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can renovate and work through the mystery next year, as There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is headed to Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026, and will be available on day one with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developers Game Science have revealed Black Myth: Zhong Kui, another single-player action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> steeped in Chinese mythology. It casts you as a ghost-hunting god who wanders between hell and Earth. Here's a CG short from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom's Open Night Live 2025</a>, which shows the fearsomely bearded Zhong Kui himself riding an extravagantly sized tiger. </p><!--more-->

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">a Q&amp;A on the official site</a>, the developers call the game a "tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design". They want Wukong players to feel "right at home" while "catching them off guard in the best way". That said, for now the new game remains "little more than an empty folder", with no release date and little sense in the CG trailer of how Zhong Kui fights, compared to Wukong. I'm guessing that tiger is a useful ally, though.</p>
<p>We quite liked the original Black Myth, with bygone reviews editor Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-is-a-pleasantly-surprising-soulslike-even-if-its-given-me-an-enemy-for-life">calling it</a> "a refreshing adventure after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s knotty DLC". We were less keen on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">the mildly draconian PR messages</a> to certain streamers, cautioning them to avoid "feminist propaganda", "politics" and discussion of the Chinese games industry.</p><p>These gamergatory memos followed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">a lengthy report from IGN</a> about alleged workplace sexism at Game Science. The devs refused to say anything to Ed about this when he asked at a preview event. If we're invited to preview Zhong Kui, we'll give it another shot.</p>
