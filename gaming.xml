Somehow I'd missed hit horror movie franchise A Quiet Place was getting a video game adaptation (it turns out I'm just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">deeply inattentive</a>), but barely a month after its re-reveal, a fresh look at its alien-evading action has come our way - and it definitely shows potential, assuming you've got the constitution for a game of near-silent sneakery and one-wrong-move tension.
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-is-a-new-single-player-story-driven-horror-game-based-on-the-film">announced back in October 2021</a> before (appropriately) going silent for a while, and is the work of Stormind Games - the studio behind 2018's surprisingly effective Clock-Tower-inspired pursuit horror Remothered: Tormented Fathers. It doesn't have a release yet, but it's currently expected to launch this year.
</p>
<p>
Unfolding across an "eerily tranquil, post-apocalyptic landscape", A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead casts players as Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin. She'll face "interpersonal family conflicts, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears" - as well as lots of silently insistent pointing, judging by the new trailer.

<p>
In gameplay terms, The Road Ahead is a first-person stealth-horror requiring players to minimise the noise they're making as they attempt to evade their sonically sensitive pursuers. There's also a shotgun and a car chase in there, so it clearly won't <em>all</em> be irritated shushing.
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009366">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead/9NZLPG7P5KSS">Xbox Series X/S</a> when it eventually shows up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190812/skaven-age-of-sigmar-army-warhammer-40k-addition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8AL3Fe"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/warhammer-40k"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> is stuffed to the brim with bad guys; nearly every faction racks up atrocities on the daily. There’s the protagonist faction, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24113824/warhammer-40k-god-emperor-lore-dark-king-star-child-godblight">Imperium of Man</a>, which is quite literally the most brutal and inhumane regime possible. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/6/18253801/warhammer-40k-chaos-space-marines-abaddon-sisters-of-battle-new-models">Chaos Space Marines</a> are engaged in a 10,000-year-long war, using the powers of the dark gods to fuel their armies. And, of course, there’s the stupid, sexy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801775/warhammer-40k-drukhari-faction-lore-dark-eldar-xenos-fun">Dark Eldar</a> who torture and pillage their way through the galaxy. But there’s one specific kind of bad guy that’s missing from the setting, and a recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161719/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-launch-box-reveal-preview-weekend-40k-aos-sisters-of-battle"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> release throws that into stark relief: I demand that Games Workshop add Skaven to 40K, you <em>cowards</em>.</p>
<p id="ejqSdd">The Skaven are a longtime presence in the Warhammer fantasy settings, including <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, an alternative fantasy setting introduced in 2015. <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/17/skaventide-is-the-jam-packed-launch-box-for-the-new-edition-of-warhammer-age-of-sigmar/">The new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> <em>Skaventide</em> box set</a> — which went up for pre-order on June 29 — pits the Skaven, a ravenous horde of rat men who are scratching at every door and every dimension in hopes of finding something to feast upon, against the noble Stormcast Eternals. <em>Age of Sigmar</em> has some great villains, like the father of necromancy and all-time hater Nagash, but few are as beloved as the Skaven. They’re even the antagonist in the popular Vermintide games developed by Fatshark. You can’t truly escape the Skaven, and the only saving grace is that they’re so busy fighting each other that they sometimes forget about their mission of total annihilation.</p>
<div id="85ipIe"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZSiQ8lG0fs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RKmcJz">The Skaven are bipedal critters who swarm en masse, which is obviously dangerous in and of itself, but the fact that they have a decent grasp on technology just makes matters worse. In the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em>, the human empires largely denied the existence of Skaven. (There are no rats living in Altdorf, waiting to rise up and overthrow humanity. That’s <em>ridiculous</em>; you must be just seeing things. Do not ask any more questions about the giant rats whomst walk like men.) They worship a Chaos entity called the Great Horned Rat, who is not a literal rat, but the metaphysical manifestation of all things ratlike. </p>
<p id="cj5bOa">The Great Horned Rat has a furry finger in a lot of different pies, but its main objective is just keeping the rest of its horde organized and focused. In the lore of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, a magical apocalypse has shattered the traditional fantasy realm of<em> Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em>, and the setting is more of a multiverse. There are eight mortal realms, and then layers of sub-realms and alternate realities. One of these is the home of the Skaven, Blight City. The Skaven have organized themselves into 13 clans and have gnawed holes into each of the eight realms. Each Skaven thinks that they’re the best rat around, which makes for a bunch of backstabbing, betrayal, and bickering.</p>
<p id="LNPITg">The Skaven are known for their use of warpstone, an extremely powerful crystal formed of pure Chaos energy, to power technology that’s highly volatile — but, also, great for doing murder. Sure, a few dozen rats might get exploded into a fine mist when getting a given McGuffin dialed in correctly, but that’s a small price for an extremely powerful auto-cannon or a far-reaching communications device.</p>
<p id="eQybvS">But why would we want a faction of sentient rats in the grim darkness of the far future? Well, we mentioned that warpstone. But also? The Great Horned Rat is kind of a big deal. Traditionally, the Warhammer settings have four Chaos gods: the violent Khorne, the scheming Tzeentch, the rapturous Slaanesh, and the plague-loving Nurgle. In <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, the Great Horned Rat is also at the table, which is a feat that many have tried but none have managed. So why not fully elevate the Skaven to the science fiction big leagues?</p>
<p id="tSpt8z">As a faction, the Skaven are in an interesting place because of their inherent duality. On one hand, they’re a bunch of silly little guys scampering around and getting up to antics. On the other hand, they’re terrifying creatures who want nothing more than to flay you and then gnaw on your bones. A Hammer and Bolter episode, normally available as part of the subscription service Warhammer Plus, was recently made available on YouTube. It shows how hunting the Skaven is a difficult task.</p>
<div id="GG43NX"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9R24vuaesUA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="39XIxA">Making matters worse, recent developments in the lore of <em>Age of Sigmar </em>have put the Skaven on the offensive. They’re no longer content with raiding and pillaging from afar. Archaon the Everchosen, one of the main antagonists of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, teamed up with the Great Horned Rat to teleport the sub-realm of Blight City into reality. A huge chunk of Blight City showed up in the realm of Aqshy, one of the mortal realms, in an event called the Vermindoom.</p>
<p id="AHjLXM">For context, imagine you saw some rat holes gnawed into the foundation of your house. You’d probably be pretty concerned, driven to put down traps and call an exterminator. Now, imagine the rats smashed through the drywall and took over the master bedroom. Before long, you might find yourself barricaded in the basement, hoping that the rat men are content with raiding your fridge for cheese.</p>
<p id="nInJ0r">It’s perhaps no surprise that the Skaven are so popular that fans regularly demand they show up in Warhammer 40,000 as well. Let me join them in saying: Please, Games Workshop, let the rat army show up in the far sci-fi future of 40K as more than just a rare cameo. It’s what we deserve. Some antagonists are nuanced, and we’re meant to see reflections of ourselves in their own moral failings. Others are giant stinky rats with a massive cannon, and that’s great. They don’t even need spaceships — rats are infamous for hitching a ride on vessels, after all. Why not a Space Hulk? </p>
<p id="2Cu0BF">I, for one, would be willing to bend the knee to our new sci-fi rat overlords — so long as Games Workshop can bring a decent 2,000-point army down to a reasonable number of miniatures. </p>

Did the community reject <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>? According to folks with knowledge of scene, it’s a bit more complicated than that, but the game has been divisive for a handful of reasons.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SakiSakuraTV/status/1807835479993143312&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SakiSakuraTV/status/1807835479993143312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commentator Saki Sakura argues</a></span> that <em>Mortal Kombat</em>’s in-person competitive scene has always been small, with a majority of players staying online.

Others, like long-time competitive NetherRealm champion SonicFox, note that since the game is banned in places like Japan, it can’t pull from the country’s fighting game community, which is a major region for other fighting game communities . They <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SonicFox/status/1807891861681721612&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SonicFox/status/1807891861681721612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weighed in</a></span> and said while <em>MK1</em> has issues, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>’s lower standing in tournament sign ups is likely the effect of years of community members dunking on the series—not just a potential dissatisfaction with the latest game.</p><p>“This has been ongoing for years,” they said in a tweet. “I genuinely believe the game is incredibly good, and is arguably in its best spot yet, but folks do not stop talking about it in a negative light. Especially from figureheads who don’t even play the game.”</p><p>While some of these phenomena may be the same old shit for NetherRealm players, <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>has definitely been divisive, and some players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dtjbyn/are_fans_really_not_enjoying_mk1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dtjbyn/are_fans_really_not_enjoying_mk1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are less forgiving</a></span> than Sonic Fox.</p><p>One of the major changes in <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>included the implementation of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-fatalities-beta-test-release-date-2023-1850591605&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-fatalities-beta-test-release-date-2023-1850591605">“Kameo” support characters</a></span> who provide assist attacks to the primary character in a fight, which has split the community, but part of the drop in concurrent players can probably be traced to casual players not feeling the grind. Maintaining a high player count requires just as much attention to be given to people not looking to throw down at their local tournament.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Yeah since release, I’ve only spent 45 hours on this game (according to my stats),” MANavarro17 wrote on Reddit. “The combat and Kameo mechanics are great, but as a casual, the grind is just ass and doesn’t feel as rewarding compared to previous games. ‘Invasions’ isn’t fun at all, most times frustrating and tedious.”</p><p>“The kameos were a bad idea imo,” Exciting_Passenger39 wrote. “I thought it was going to be like a tag team setup not this bs we got.”</p><p>“For all intents and purposes, I’m a mega fan of this franchise but I must say, yeah, I’m not super enthralled with <em>MK1</em>,” RealmJumper15 wrote. “The gameplay is fun and the Kameo system is neat but outside of that the game doesn’t really have anything to keep me around.”</p></blockquote><p>But some still argue that <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>(and the franchise broadly) isn’t built for long-term competitive play, and that’s what makes it approachable compared than its contemporaries. So perhaps it doesn’t matter that it doesn’t draw as many competitive players to EVO.</p><p>“I think it’s probably because of the entirely competitive side of things,” ChemistryTasty8751 wrote. “Other fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em> pride themselves on balancing for pro play and competitive, trying to outdo each other with high-budget tournaments. Meanwhile <em>Mortal Kombat</em> don’t fuck with that. <em>Mortal Kombat</em> is a game that prioritizes casual fun because it’s the only fighting game I would actually recommend to newbies because it’s not ‘you need to hit this frame perfect input and space yourself at this exact point to remove end lag’ It’s more ‘here’s your character, go nuts.”</p><p>But in the broader competitive landscape, is it not concerning that <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>is trailing so far behind not only its direct competitors, but its own games?</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“This is actually hilariously pitiful,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dszfbq/evo_final_registration_numbers_for_mk1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dszfbq/evo_final_registration_numbers_for_mk1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NatiHanson wrote</a></span> regarding <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s registration numbers on Reddit. “People are gonna come up with different forms of copuim, but this is sad. Year 2 MKX had more entrants than this. NetherRealm were completely caught off guard with the competition (<em>T8</em>, <em>SF6</em>), and I don’t think Kameos caught on like they hoped.”</p><p>“<em>Tekken</em> and <em>SF</em> and even anime are putting out the best products they probably ever have (I’m not saying game DESIGN necessarily - but just AS A PRODUCT),” Vergilkilla wrote in response. “Meanwhile NRS—while the gameplay of <em>MK1</em> is a massive improvement over <em>MK11</em>—as a product it is worse. Buggier, less content, less modes, worse online than the previous game for some reason. It’s a worse consumer product even if it is a better game.

<p>Nexon certainly has a reputation in the gaming community for its numerous projects falling by the wayside. As such, folks feel somewhat cautious about approaching The First Descendant—a free-to-play third-person shooter that resembles a mixture of Destiny 2 and Warframe. But if you’re on the fence, this may be the deciding factor you need to try the game. So, do you need a Nexon account to play The First Descendant?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-first-descendant-require-a-nexon-account">Does The First Descendant Require a Nexon Account?</h2>



<p>You’ll be happy to know that The First Descendant does not require a Nexon account to play the free-to-play looter-shooter. You require an account if you wish to participate in the game’s cross-progression mechanics or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-score-all-of-the-first-descendant-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receive the game’s many Twitch Drops</a>.</p>



<p>If you don’t care about cosmetics, emotes, or in-game currency, and if you only play your games on a single system, you don’t need to worry about signing up for a Nexon account. But if you intend to dive deep into The First Descendant on, say, PC and PlayStation 5, then you’ll want to sign up for a free Nexon account.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-first-descendant-cross-progression-works">How The First Descendant Cross-Progression Works</h2>



<p>As mentioned, The First Descendant does offer cross-progression support. However, you must sign up for a Nexon account to use the system. Once you’re set, the game will allow you to pick up your progress, characters, stats, and equipment on any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-systems-first-descendant-releasing-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported system</a>. Currently, The First Descendant is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S—free to download and play on any of these systems!</p>

<p>It’s always nice to know the exact system requirements of an upcoming game that you’re most excited about playing. In this case, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It’s a gorgeous game from what we’ve seen of its trailers, thanks to Capcom. But can you run the game? Here are the current Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster system requirements, though they’re subject to change before the game’s official release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-system-requirements">What Are the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster System Requirements?</h2>



<p>As you can see from the official Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster system requirements below, the upcoming third-person zombie-slaying adventure isn’t overly demanding. It’s not an official remake, so the requirements prove rather accommodating to most systems these days. That said, it does support 4K, so if you want the zombie gore in ultra graphics, you’ll need a beefier system!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-6700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3400G</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070ti / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-will-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-on">What Systems Will Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Release On?</h2>



<p>We hope you’re ready to once again visit Willamette Mall, albeit in gorgeous 60 FPS and 4K resolution in the upcoming remaster. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will launch simultaneously on:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It will not, as of right now, launch on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, however. The last-gen consoles won’t get the opportunity to enjoy the remaster, though the original is still available to many who have yet to upgrade!</p>

<p>Speaking of old-school games making a return, can you play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition on Steam Deck</a>?

            <p>Surgent Studios has reportedly laid off an undisclosed number of employees.</p>
<p>The cuts come just three months after its latest release, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, released to strong critic and fan reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst neither the studio itself nor founder Abubakar Salim has commented publicly on the layoffs, former Surgent devs have discussed the redundancies on their personal social media profiles.</p>
<p>"The chapter entitled 'Pete Works At Surgent Studios' is coming to a close at the end of the month," wrote former level designer Peter Brisbourne on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peteb_hello-the-chapter-entitled-pete-works-at-activity-7213868361368174594-wVBF/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm another casualty of the Wild West industry that is video game development," added producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213870230530334720/">Phillip Smy</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a producer wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> yesterday that there was a "very high likelihood [they were] going to get some really bad news", and updated today with a simple: "Well, I’ve officially been laid off, as expected. Sh*t sucks."</p>

			<p>As part of the ongoing exclusive Game Informer coverage, BioWare <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more information on the difficulty settings available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Preset difficulty options include Storyteller, Adventurer, and Nightmare, which are pretty self-explanatory. You may swap between them at your leisure, with the notable exception of Nightmare difficulty: once that has been selected for a playthrough, it cannot be reverted. You'd have to start a new one at a lower setting if needed.</p>
<p>The surprise option is the custom 'Unbound' setting, which will allow players to craft their own challenge level by tweaking parameters like parry timing, aim assistance (up to auto-aim), enemy pressure (how quickly and often you will be attacked), the amount of damage dealt to and received from enemies, and even wayfinding. Last but not least, fans who are interested in Dragon Age: The Veilguard solely because of the story (and there are quite a few of those) can turn on the no-death setting.</p>
<p>Game Director Corinne Busche told Game Informer that the studio doesn't consider these as 'cheat' options. Rather, they have been implemented to allow all kinds of fans to partake in the adventure. Players can expect other accessibility features, too, with more information to be shared closer to launch.</p>
<p>On that note, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is still scheduled for a generic Fall 2024 launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. That may change soon, though, with Gamescom around a month and a half away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190770/game-pass-july-2024-free-xbox-games-case-of-the-golden-idol-tchia-neon-white-flock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="WNbCum">Microsoft has revealed what’s coming to Game Pass during the first half of July and, while absent any big-hitters, the lineup features at least four really excellent indie games that will be well worth your time during this relative dry spell for big releases.</p>
<p id="T31elC">Polygon’s favorite of the lot is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23433618/case-of-the-golden-idol-review-return-of-obra-dinn-detective-game"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a>, joining Game Pass on July 9: a hilarious, macabre point-and-click detective mystery set in the 18th century, with an illustration style you’ll never forget. It’s also an excellent puzzle game with perhaps the most satisfying murder-mystery detection mechanics in any video game.</p>
<p id="c92Gmz">But it’s far from being the only worthwhile pick here. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23645683/tchia-review-action-adventure-zelda-open-world"><em>Tchia</em></a> (joining July 11) is a joyful, Zelda-influenced open-world exploration game set in a version of the beautiful Pacific island nation of New Caledonia. If you fancy something a little less sedate, may we direct you toward <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23185130/neon-white-review-speedrun-fps-deck-builder-pc-switch"><em>Neon White</em></a> (also July 11), a fast-paced, first-person, anime-style action game about slaying demons. It’s a speedrunners’ delight, with a perfect difficulty curve, and you might find your friends’ leaderboard gets pretty competitive.</p>
<p id="0FEa7e">Also of note: <em>Flock</em> is a new release coming to Game Pass on day one on July 16. This chill multiplayer game about the joy of flight isn’t out yet, but what we’ve seen is very promising indeed.</p>
<p id="68DdZc">Here’s everything coming to Game Pass over the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>It’s a day that many football fans have been waiting for for a long time, a deep dive into the Dynasty Mode coming to College Football 25.</p>



<p>The deep dive comes with a six-minute trailer along with a 17,000-word blog post from EA. In it, everything you can expect from the mode is covered. From the coaching carousel to recruiting to conference alignment to even how gameplay falls into off-field decisions. It’s clear that a lot of passion has gone into the mode, and it shows with the deep dive.</p>



<p>Without getting into all 17,000 words of it, here are a few of the biggest takeaways:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can be a head coach, offensive coordinator, or defensive coordinator</li>



<li>Coaches fall under three archetype categories: Recruiting, Motivation, Scheme</li>



<li>RPG-like skill tree for your coaches</li>



<li>Over 3,500 high school recruits are generated each year to scout</li>



<li>14 pitch grades to determine a recruit’s interest in your school</li>



<li>Some players have dealbreakers than can lead to them not wanting to talk with you or even transfer from your school.</li>



<li>Players can de-commit from your school ahead of National Signing Day</li>



<li>Full conference re-alignment</li>



<li>Team Builder allows importing of up to 16 teams per dynasty (private dynasties only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Stormind Games and Saber Interactive unveiled their upcoming single-player, first-person horror title back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-coming-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-June</a>, and the fans went wild. The game, deeply rooted in the popular movie franchise by Paramount Pictures, A Quiet Place, has now given us A Quiet Place: Road Ahead, a brand new story trailer that brings back the familiar elements of the movies while introducing new and exciting gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead – Official First Story Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC2rNzzmhXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The latest trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead not only showcases how the franchise’s blind extraterrestrial creatures with superhuman hearing will appear and behave in the game but also hints at the game’s exploration of the origins of this world with an original storyline. This storyline will seemingly delve into how the aliens invaded and impacted the planet, introducing new characters and narratives to the franchise.</p>



<p>In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, we’ll see Alex, a college student with asthma, navigating a terrifying alien invasion alongside her boyfriend, Martin. The situation becomes even more challenging for Alex as she discovers she’s pregnant. The trailer promises intense moments as the couple faces close encounters with the fearsome blind beasts of the franchise. And man, it looks scary in the first person.</p>



<p>“A Quiet Place” is an expansive post-apocalyptic horror film series produced by Paramount Pictures. The franchise boasts a talented cast, including John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and other notable actors. Krasinski and Michael Sarnoski have directed the series, which has already seen the release of three movies. The most recent instalment, “A Quiet Place: Day One,” hit the screens a few days ago. It will undoubtedly be intriguing to witness how this popular franchise transitions into the realm of gaming.</p>

        <p>"Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Nintendo of America has filed lawsuits against two individuals it accuses of violating its copyright by trading and selling "circumvention devices".</p>
<p>In court papers uploaded to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/">Torrent Freak</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-modded.pdf">Ryan Michael Daly </a>of Modded Hardware – a website Nintendo believes has contravened the DMCA by selling modded consoles, pirated games, and mod chips – has been accused of trafficking in circumvention devices, copyright infringement, breach of EULA contract, and tortious interference with contract.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">James C. Williams</a> – known online as 'Archbox' – has similarly been accused of copyright infringement, circumvention of technological measures, trafficking in circumvention devices, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contract.</p>
<p>The complaint – filed in Seattle, Washington, on June 28 – states that the defendants' sale and distribution of "circumvention devices, hacked consoles, and circumvention services" has done "substantial and irreparable harm" to Nintendo.</p>
<p>"Defendant not only offers the hardware and firmware to create and play pirated games, but he also provides his customers with copies of pirated Nintendo games," the lawsuit against Daly asserts.</p>
<p>"Typically, when a customer purchases a Hacked Console or the Circumvention Services, Defendant preinstalls on the console a portfolio of ready-to-play pirated games, including some of Nintendo’s most popular titles such as its Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid games."</p>
<p>Nintendo adds that "it is only because of products and services such as those sold by Defendant that illegal marketplaces distributing pirated games exist and thrive".</p>
<p>In Williams' paperwork, Nintendo claims he "became a leading (if not the primary) moderator of the SwitchPirates Reddit community, which he helped grow to nearly 190,000 members."</p>
<p>Nintendo claims it issued a cease and desist to both Daly and Williams in March 2024 and alleges the latter "bragged publicly that he is a 'pirate' who '[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game'."</p>
<p>The "defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights," Nintendo states.</p>
<p>Back in May, Nintendo issued a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-issues-dmca-takedown-notice-against-over-8500-yuzu-emulator-repositories">DMCA takedown notice against 8,535 GitHub repositories that contained code from the Yuzu emulator for Switch</a>. It followed a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-yuzu-developer-settle-lawsuit-for-24m">settlement in March between Nintendo and Yuzu developer Tropic Haze</a>, in which the latter agreed to pay $2.4 million to the company and end its support for the emulator.</p>
<p>Nintendo initially <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-files-lawsuit-against-yuzu-emulator-creators">took legal action against Tropic Haze in February</a> for copyright infringement and, back in April 2023, the Paris Court of Appeals sided with Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-court-battle-against-site-used-to-pirate-its-games">similar dispute with sharehosting website operator Dstorage</a>.</p>

		<p>Publisher Kasedo Games and development studio Bulwark Studios have confirmed that the sci-fi city builder will be releasing on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. It was released in 2022 for PC. The announcement trailer shows some of the issues you will be dealing with as the unlucky Administrator of the space station Tiqqun.</p>
<p><iframe title="IXION | Console Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QU5eYqtXvCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for IXION says, <em>“IXION is a city-builder that requires you to be vigilant, to constantly assess and reassess, to learn and adapt. If you and your crew are to endure, you must confront the perils of space, while at the same time uncovering its secrets and extracting its resources. Danger, however, will come from within as well as without; you’ll need to establish, maintain and develop the Tiqqun’s infrastructure while managing the station’s population, deciding how best to answer their pleas so as to maintain their trust in you and the mission.”</em></p>
<p>Every single decision you make as the Administrator of the Tiqqun will have consequences that will have both immediate and long term impacts. There are issues like electrical fires and hull breaches to deal with too, and there is no help readily available. IXION is a game that will have tough decisions, and you will need to balance the needs of the survivors with the reality of trying to survive in a drifting space station.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two years after we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-pc-beta-test-dated-ue5-f2p-looter-shooter-also-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered the game</a> ahead of a PC beta test, NEXON has finally released The First Descendant, its free-to-play third-person looter shooter game. During this time, the Unreal Engine 5-powered title underwent various tweaks and additions, some directly requested by fans (over two million users played the cross-play open beta).</p>
<p>Beomjun Lee, Game Producer at NEXON Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>With The First Descendant being our first global multi-platform launch, we wanted to develop something that allowed the voices of our players to be heard. Our goal is not only to create a game that we are proud of, but also to create something our players will love and enjoy for a long time. We implemented many changes for launch based on the community's requests and we hope it makes the experience even more enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>Minseok Joo, Game Creative Director at NEXON Games, added:</p>
<p><em>Descendants, from everyone on our development team, we thank you sincerely for choosing to join us in the fight against The Vulgus. Back when we first developed this concept in 2019, we set out to create a world inspired by some of our personal favorite looter shooters. The genre holds a special place in our hearts, and our development team has worked hard to create a game that we believe stands proudly among those prominent titles.</em></p>
<p>In the game, players choose one out of 19 playable characters, the titular Descendants, heroes who protect humanity against the alien invaders from The Vulgus. The playable roster is split between 14 original Descendants and 5 high-performance ultimate Descendants. Three new playable characters have been introduced with the launch build: Esiemo, Enzo, and Yujin. Esiemo handles explosives with a unique and dynamic gameplay style; Enzo is a support character with the ability to supply ammunition, making him suitable for tactical weapons. Yujin is a healing Descendant, and when played cooperatively with another player, can bring new cooperative strategies. Additionally, new high-performance Ultimate Descendants have been added, joining the previously announced Ultimate Lepic and Ultimate Viessa: Ultimate Ajax, Ultimate Bunny, and Ultimate Grey.</p>
<p>As with any looter shooter, players will enhance their character's statistics and gear by equipping loot, in this case, modules (of which there are 560). The First Descendant includes 11 weapon types and 22 Ultimate weapons at launch. Modules can boost their attack power, modify recoil, and add extra effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant│Play Free Now│Dev Launch Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxkdEC6hUjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The endgame content includes the instanced dungeons named Infiltration Operations and large boss raids called Void Intercept Battles. In the former, players can choose between normal and hard difficulty. The latter allows you to add extra challenge options called modifiers before starting the mission. The more challenge options you add, the more points you'll be able to earn for more rewards. There are 16 Infiltration Operations at launch.</p>
<p>In Void Intercept Battles, Descendants are tasked with defeating the massive Colossi bosses (who are equipped with unique attack patterns) by targeting weak points with unique strategies. This content is meant to be played cooperatively with up to four players, but it can also be completed solo. At launch, there are 16 bosses, including Executioner, Dead Bride, Devourer, Pyromaniac, Swamp Walker, Obstructer, Frost Walker, and Molten Fortress.</p>
<p>The main story was also revised following the community's feedback, making it more immersive. Descendants will now appear as NPCs (non-player characters) throughout the storyline. They will also have their own quests to better understand their personalities, starting with Bunny, whose quest is available at launch.</p>
<p>So far, a lot of players are checking out The First Descendant. NEXON's new game has reached Steam's Top 10 chart. As we are writing this article, the game is ranked #6 after Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, PUBG, and Banana, with around 217K players currently online,<a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> according to SteamDB</a>. However, user reviews are currently quite low: only 42% of the 5,349 reviews already posted recommend the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant | RTX On Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrO58UTTVis?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a reminder, The First Descendant supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction), NVIDIA DLAA, and Reflex on PC. According to NVIDIA, the GeForce RTX 4090 can run at an average of 125 FPS at 4K (thanks to a 2.5X DLSS boost) with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode.</p>
<p>AMD users can activate AMD FSR 2.2 (although it should be updated to FSR 3 soon), and Intel XeSS 1.1 is also supported. Moreover, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> HDR10+ displays. If you don't have a powerful enough PC, cloud streaming via GeForce is also available.</p>
<p>On consoles, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-descendant-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer</a> three graphic modes: Fidelity, Balanced, and Performance. Ray Tracing and AMD Frame Generation are also optionally available.</p>

<p>Surgent Studios, the studio behind Tales of Kenzera: Zau, is the latest developer to be hit with layoffs.</p>



<p>The news comes via multiple LinkedIn posts from, now former, employees at Surgent. </p>



<p>“Well, it looks like I’m joining all the people affected by industry layoffs this year,” technical artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jordan Smee said</a>.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, I have been affected by the layoffs at Surgent Studios,” 3D Environment Artist Joe Phillpot wrote.</p>



<p>Level designer Pete Brisbourne posted that, “The chapter entitled “Pete Works At Surgent Studios” is coming to a close at the end of the month.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear how many people at the studio are being let go. It’s also unclear as to why the layoffs are being made at this time.</p>



<p>Tales of Kenzera: Zau launched in April on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. As of writing, the game has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tales-of-kenzera-zau/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic score of 76</a> or generally favorable.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Surgent and studio founder Abubakar Salim for comment on the situation. Should we receive a response, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some adjustments are made to conversion kits for various weapons in multiplayer. The JAK Jawbreaker conversion kit for the KV Broadside shotgun no longer blocks the JAK BFB muzzle attachment and it can now be equipped. The update also fixes incorrect iron sights and misaligned optics that previously happened after unequipping the JAK Requiem conversion kit for the Kastov 762 and Kastov 545 assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">Two changes are included for Zombies mode. The Zombies completionist camos can now be equipped to the Sledgehammer, and an issue is fixed that previously caused a server disconnection error when a player left an Unstable Rift.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warzone side of the update is much smaller and only includes a few weapon changes. This includes another nerf for the Kar98k marksman rifle, with a decrease to the lower-torso damage modifier from 1.1x to .95x, a reduction to the arm modifiers from 1.2x to .95x, and a decrease to the leg modifiers from 1x to .95x. The popular Superi 46 submachine gun also has a reduction to its damage modifiers with a decrease to the lower torso, lower arm and hand modifiers from 1.3x down to 1.1x each.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be seen below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-adding-patriotic-uncle-sam-operator-for-4th-of-july/1100-6524532/">patriotic Uncle Sam operator</a> was added to MW3 and Warzone, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine crossover</a> could potentially happen in Season 5.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h3>CUSTOMIZATION</h3><ul><li>Corrected art displayed for the Kill Shot Emblem in the Season 4 Battle Pass.</li></ul><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Improved visual style of the notification that appears after changing Loadout mid-match.</li><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the After Action Report to unexpectedly close.</li><li>Corrected HUD prompts when controlling the Missle Drone Killstreak with an alternate button layout.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>Underbarrel Launcher Attachments will now progress Challenges requiring double kills with Grenades.</li><li>Improved tracking of the double kills Camo Challenge for the Reclaimer 18 Shotgun.</li><li>DG-58 Micro Barrel Attachment for the DG-56 will no longer remain locked after reaching the Weapon Level requirement.</li><li>Addressed an issue causing Gilded Camo for certain Weapons to remain locked after unlock requirements are met.</li></ul><h3>MODES</h3><ul><li>Bit Party  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing inconsistent score upon tag collection in Kill Confirmed.</li></ul></li><li>Mutation  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the HUD to not match the selected Mutant’s abilities.</li><li>Radioactive Beast will now drown if submerged in water for too long.</li><li>Mutant Perks are no longer inactive during the first life after the halftime team switch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp; ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>Assault Rifles</p><ul><li>Kastov 762 &amp; 545  <ul><li>JAK Requiem Conversion Kit  <ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and misaligned Optics after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Submachine Guns</p><ul><li>FJX Horus  <ul><li>JAK Scimitar Kit  <ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and blocked Barrel Attachments after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Shotguns</p><ul><li>KV Broadside (MWII)  <ul><li>JAK Jawbreaker Conversion Kit  <ul><li>JAK BFB Muzzle Attachment is no longer blocked and can now be equipped.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Sniper Rifles</p><ul><li>FJX Imperium (MWII)  <ul><li>Removed incompatible Ammunition Attachments that could not be unlocked.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Handguns</p><ul><li>.50 GS (MWII) &amp; GS Magna (MWII)  <ul><li>JAK NRG-IV Optic can no longer be equipped without a compatible Barrel.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Launchers</p><ul><li>RGL-80  <ul><li>40mm Slug Ammunition (JAK Thumper-656 Conversion Kit)  <ul><li>Increased minimum damage from 95 to 150 (+58%).</li><li>Removed unintended explosive damage properties.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Zombies Completionist Camos can now be equipped to the Sledgehammer, normally.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE WEAPONS</h2><h3><b><u>ADJUSTMENTS</u></b></h3><h4>ASSAULT RIFLES</h4><p>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>KASTOV 762 &amp; 545 (MWII)</h3><ul><li><b>JAK Requiem Conversion Kit</b><ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and misaligned Optics after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>SUBMACHINE GUNS</h4><p>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>SUPERI 46</h3><ul><li>Lower Torso Modifier decreased to 1.1x, down from 1.3x.</li><li>Lower Arm and Hand Modifiers decreased to 1.1x, down from 1.3x.</li></ul><h3>FJX HORUS</h3><ul><li><b>JAK Scimitar Kit</b><ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and blocked Barrel Attachments after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>MARKSMAN RIFLES</h4><p>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>KAR98K</h3><ul><li>Lower Torso Modifier decreased to .95x, down from 1.1x.</li><li>Arm Modifiers decreased to .95x, down from 1.2x.</li><li>Leg Modifiers decreased to .95x, down from 1x.</li></ul>

<p dir="ltr">Aptly titled "Silver Layered Necklace" in-game, the expensive bling's addition to the Ponsonby's catalogue has some players convinced the jewelry may have some sort of significance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Could be a stretch but whatever the price of that necklace is might mean something," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/comment/lb403xt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">one comment</a> on the post. Another player's reply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/comment/lb43r78/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">suggests the necklace's price could be a hint</a> at the game's launch date, which has not yet been announced. (The necklace's in-game price isn't shown in the post, but it likely goes for a little over $30,000, based on other items for sale in the store.)</p><p>In all likelihood, the necklace's addition to GTA Online's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-summer-update-introduces-diy-bounty-hunting-new-creator-tools/1100-6523963/">bounty-hunting update</a> is simply an Easter egg referencing GTA 6, but that hasn't stopped players from coming up with some pretty wild theories. The next installment in the Grand Theft Auto series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">currently scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025</a>, but Rockstar Games has yet to share a specific release date.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Descendants, from everyone on our development team we thank you sincerely for choosing to join us in the fight against The Vulgus," creative director Minseok Joo said in a recent press release. "Back when we first developed this concept in 2019, we set out to create a world inspired by some of our personal favorite looter shooters. The genre holds a special place in our hearts, and our development team has worked hard to create a game that we believe stands proudly among those prominent titles."</p><p dir="ltr">"With The First Descendant being our first global multi-platform launch, we wanted to develop something that allowed the voices of our players to be heard," producer Beomjun Lee added. "Our goal is not only to create a game that we are proud of, but also to create something our players will love and enjoy for a long time. We implemented many changes for launch based on the community's requests and we hope it makes the experience even more enjoyable."</p><p dir="ltr">The game's pre-season launch period has introduced a battle pass that includes three new playable Descendants: Esiemo, Enzo, and Yujin. The battle pass also gives players access to new weapons, Void Intercept Battles, and Instance Dungeons, along with other exclusive content.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking to the future, Nexon Games has announced plans to update the game five weeks after launch, though it's not immediately clear what that update will include. A second update, Season 1 Episode: Invasion, will arrive sometime in August, and will feature a new Descendant, new Colossus, new dungeon, and new weapon. According to Nexon, Season 1 Episode: Invasion will also dive deeper into the backstory of a "fan-favorite Descendant."</p><p>The First Descendant is currently available for free on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. For more information on Descendants, weapons, and the new battle pass, check out <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/main" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a>.</p>

This month continues that trend with some real bangers worth checking out if you are a subscriber. </p><p>Here’s the list of games coming to Game Pass over the next few weeks and which platforms they will be available on:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - July 3<br></li><li><strong><em>Nickelodeon All-Sta</em>r Brawl 2 </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 3</li><li>  <strong><em>Cricket 24</em></strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 9</li><li>  <strong><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 9</li><li>  <strong><em>Neon White</em> </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 11</li><li>  <strong><em>Tchia</em> </strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – July 11</li><li>  <strong><em>Magical Delicacy </em></strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 16</li><li>  <strong><em>Flock </em></strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 16</li></ul><p>Some standouts this month include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-the-kotaku-review-1841220139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-the-kotaku-review-1841220139"><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></a></span>, which has a less-than-stellar name but is still a fun semi-open-world survival-action game about exploring an alien environment filled with weird creatures and colorful art. </p><div><p>I also loved <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"><em>Neon White</em></a></span>, a first-person hyper-fast action platformer built around mastering short, gorgeous levels set in a fucked-up version of Heaven. </p><p>I haven’t played <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em>, but it has a reputation for being one of the best detective games in recent years, so maybe I’ll finally take this opportunity to check it out.</p></div><p>And hey, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-new-characters-trailer-1850682210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-new-characters-trailer-1850682210"><em>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2</em></a></span><em> </em>might not be as good as <em>Smash Bros.</em> but it will be free on Game Pass on July 3 and might be a perfect party game to load up the next time you and your friends get together. You can all pick your favorite cartoon characters and beat the shit out of each other over the 4th of July. </p><p>But, as new games arrive, old games must leave as deals expire. According to Xbox, these are all the games leaving Game Pass on July 15:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly</em></strong>&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Figment 2: Creed Valley</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>TOEM</strong></em></li><li><strong><em>The Wandering Village</em>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>If you’re playing any of these titles, you need to finish them up soon. Or take advantage of the Game Pass discount and buy one or more of these games so you can play it forever. Or well, until Xbox decides to shut off the servers. So at least a decade or so. That seems like plenty of time to beat <em>Coffee Talk Episode 2.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
