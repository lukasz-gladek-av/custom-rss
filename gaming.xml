<p>It's the Obstagoon Parade!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company is back with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion of 2026, and it's a <em>fantastical</em> one.</p>
<p>The 'Fantastical Parade' set launches on <strong>28th January</strong> at <strong>5pm PST / 1am GMT (29th) / 2am CET (29th)</strong>, featuring none other than Gardevoir on the cover. This one throws in a couple of new Mega ex cards for Gardevoir, Mawile and Teal Mask Ogerpon, as well as a particularly fetching full art card of Falinks.</p>
<p>The above trailer provides a pretty decent overview of what we can expect from the expansion, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>Fantastical Parade will also see the introduction of Stadium cards into TCG Pocket, which, much like the regular card game, can apply effects over the entire battle.</p>
<p>With just one week until this one arrives, it might be a good time to start saving your Pack Hourglasses.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-goes-full-liquidation-on-docking-stations-its-14-port-160w-dock-crashes-to-an-all-time-low-2000661988</link>
            <guid>1413325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s not uncommon for workstations and gaming setups to get cluttered fast. Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and managing each of them can be a hassle. If you’re looking to reduce the cable mess on your desk and want something that can power/charge all your essentials at once, we recommend checking the 14-port Anker Prime docking station out, especially at its current price.</p>
<p>This 14-in-1 solution is great for charging, transferring data, and even managing dual displays. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">It normally retails for a not-so-friendly price of $270, but you can grab it today for just $170 at Amazon. That’s after a massive 37% limited time discount</a>. It’s a straightforward offer, meaning you don’t have to worry about using any coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Delivery is free too, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Manage All Your Essentials In a Single Place</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 ports in total, which lets you manage a ton of gadgets simultaneously. At the front, you’ll find USB-C and USB-A for fast data transfers and charging, plus an audio jack for headphones or earbuds. The back features HDMI ports for a multi-monitor setup, as well as an Ethernet port, additional USB-A ports, and a USB-C upstream connection for your laptop.</p>
<p>A 160W of total output is capable of fast charging up to four devices at the same time using three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max. Moving files across will take seconds, too, thanks to speedy transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. Translation? With this at hand, you can connect all your important peripherals in one place. Think topping up your phone up as you finish a work deadline, plus offloading heavy files from your PC to a secondary storage device in just a couple of minutes.</p>



<p>Those who prefer a larger, more productive setup will appreciate how the dual HDMI ports offer crystal-clear streaming or mirroring across two displays at up to 2K@60Hz with a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 laptop. With Windows, you can use the setup to keep meetings on the secondary display while working on the main one, or even use a third display for reference material. It works a bit differently on macOS, however, as both external displays will mirror the same content.</p>
<p>Compatibility-wise, the dock supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections, plus plays nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. What’s even better is that it comes with an efficient airflow system, and the ActiveShield technology monitors the temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to maintain optimal performance, even when things get a bit intense. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating and negatively impacting the connected devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box is the 14-in-1 Anker dock itself, a USB-C cable for the upstream port (3.3 ft, 100W, 10Gbps), and a safety sheet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">The dock is now available for just $170 at Amazon, down from $270. It’s not every day you get to save a nice $100 on an efficient solution such as this one</a>. Additionally, the offer is likely going to expire soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/akira-yamaoka-on-remaking-silent-hill-2s-soundtrack-again-for-return-to-silent-hill</link>
            <guid>1413313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill franchise has stood the test of time for many reasons, not least of which being the haunting, ethereal soundscapes of these survival horror games. And when it came to adapting Silent Hill to film, perhaps the smartest thing director Cristophe Gans did was make sure that series composer Akira Yamaoka was still involved.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now Silent Hill is back in theaters with the third film in the series, Return to Silent Hill, and Yamaoka is along for the ride again. IGN was recently able to speak with Yamaoka about his work, how composing a Silent Hill movie is very different from the games, and which game he’d like to see adapted next. Read on to see what he had to say. [<em>Note - this interview was performed with the aid of a translator.</em>]</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is effectively an adaptation of the Silent Hill 2 game. What makes Yamaoka’s involvement interesting is that this is effectively the third time he’s worked on this particular soundtrack. He scored the original Silent Hill 2 back in 2002, and he rebuilt his work from the ground up for the 2024 remake. Now he’s tackling that soundtrack from a whole new angle for the film version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka explains to IGN that there’s a fundamental difference between scoring for games and scoring for film. One is an interactive medium where the other is linear, and that makes a profound difference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the major differences between video games and film is, as you know, film is a linear format as opposed to video games, [which are] an interactive format where people have choices,” Yamaoka tells IGN. “People with a controller can decide how they experience the story. We have to create the music and all the elements to be interactive so that it can follow how the player plays the games.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka continues, “But the film is, of course, different; it's a linear format. So what that means is everybody would watch the music at certain scenes, and so it's very much predictable, or it's more pre-decided, because that's what the film experience is. That gives me the opportunity to create a much deeper emotional experience, something that we can have even deeper and sharper creative intent for each moment. That to me is a very different opportunity that I was given compared to video games.”  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Silent Hill Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Yamaoka if there were any particular themes or motifs from Silent Hill 2 he was eager to explore and rearrange for Return to Silent Hill, to which he pointed to a pair of classic songs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are many songs that came from the games, such as ‘Theme of Laura’ and ‘Promise.’ And again, as we discussed earlier, linear format film is different from video games, so that allows us to have music for certain emotional effects that the director would like to share with the audience. To create the experience, we were able to change the tempo and spot, really just specifically have the music in a certain way at the tempo and the tone and tension and temperature so that it would support the specific scene. That is a really just wonderful opportunity that we have for the film. It's much more than the length of the scenes, or maybe just the format of the scenes, but it's just the opportunity that we have to be much more, have a micro-control, specific control to have an emotional delivery. So naturally, I enjoy the process of rearranging the themes, and again, including ‘Theme of Laura’ and ‘Promise’ and other music that came from the games to be very film-specific so that we could deliver the emotional message and vision that Christophe Gans had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka makes it clear that Gans had a very specific vision for how he wanted his sequel to sound. That included selecting certain themes and songs from other games in the Silent Hill series. It was all about furthering the director’s vision for the film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a creative vision that the director had, because, of course, he focuses on the emotion and he focuses on how to deliver it” Yamaoka says. “There are certain songs from other Silent Hills that had a very good fit for what he was trying to achieve. And of course, it was not one-directional. It was a communication process where the director and myself had to come to the conclusion that there are maybe certain scenes where we could use different music.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the elements that separates Return to Silent Hill from the source material is that the film includes a series of flashbacks exploring the romance between James Sunderland (Jeremy Irvine) and Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson). We were curious how Yamaoka wanted to take advantage of that new material and explore a relatively happier period for these characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's one of the very unique elements of the film, and we had a great creative opportunity to discuss this with the director,” Yamaoka says. “When I saw it, I first tried to approach it in a melancholic way, reading towards romantic music and realized that this is an impossible approach. I had a chance to share this with Christophe Gans and run it by him. He gave me really wonderful feedback, and he suggested that maybe we can shift the direction to a different way, so then I tried that direction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka continues, “So it was very much a communicative, very creative process and a communication process that we had that, after the impression that I received, I ran the idea by him sometimes by presenting the music to the scenes already. We just had many of our creative thoughts, so we exchanged our ideas a lot. So it was very much a collaborative process, and I really enjoyed it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s the question of what the future might hold for the Silent Hill movie series. To date, the films have mostly adapted material from the original three games. Assuming a fourth is greenlit at some point, what game would Yamaoka like to see adapted next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, I'd really love to see other Silent Hills become filmed, but if I were to pick one, maybe I would say Silent Hill 4: The Room, because it's the unique Silent Hill in that it was a first-person game experience. And also, the setting is very different from the previous Silent Hills from Silent Hill 1 to 3, which has been transported to a different town, but Silent Hill 4 is different. So naturally, the nature of Silent Hill is different, but still the creative essence - the experience itself - stays the same. So I think it has a wonderful opportunity to become a film and provide the core elements and experience within Silent Hill. And I certainly hope that it'll be directed by Christophe Gans. He's just really wonderful, and I really hope that we have a chance to collaborate on that too, if we have the opportunity.”</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill hits theaters on January 23.

            <p>
Veteran Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe, perhaps best known for his work overseeing the long-running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> series, is reportedly retiring after almost four decades with the company.
</p>
<p>
Tanabe joined Nintendo in 1987, serving as director and course designer on Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic - the game retooled into Super Mario Bros. 2 for release in the west. Since then, Tanabe has been involved in almost every major Nintendo franchise, from The Legend of Zelda to Donkey Kong.

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4 review in video form.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTb-cC6Sw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
2002 saw Tanabe helping steer the Metroid series toward its three-dimensional debut as co-producer on Metroid Prime, and he's continued to serve as producer on the series in the years since, overseeing the likes of Metroid Prime 2, Metroid Prime 3, and Metroid Prime: Federation Force. That's alongside producer work on many other series, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, Kirby, and WarioWare.
</p><p>
But it appears Tanabe's time with Nintendo is now at an end following the release of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">reported by VGC</a>, Tanabe announced his retirement in an interview with Japanese magazine Nintendo Dream, uploaded to Chinese social media platform Weibo. "I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward," he explained (via machine translation), adding "It's been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo."
</p>
<p>
Tanabe also revealed a sequel to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "still uncertain" but expressed his hope that developer Retro Studios and Risa Tabata - who served as assistant producer on last year's game, and who'll reportedly succeed Tanabe - "will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close." We've asked Nintendo for comment.
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 did, of course, have a long and troubled history, initially being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch">announced in 2017</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-development-rebooted-from-scratch">all work at Bandai Namco Studios was scrapped</a> and shifted to previous Metroid Prime developer Retro Studios. When it finally launched for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> last December, it was to a mixed reception. "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through," Eurogamer's Alex Donladson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">wrote in his three star review</a>, "but this game could and should have been so much more."

<p>Steam fests have proven themselves to be powerful marketing tools in the right hands, with various AAA and indie developers using it to their advantage in promoting games along specific genres of thematic lines.

<p>This means that after its seventh month on the market, Nintendo's new system is still the fastest-selling home console in US history. Piscatella noted afterwards that the Game Boy Advance is the overall winner in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this means that the Switch 2's install base is nearly double that of its predecessor after the same amount of time. It's also roughly 35% ahead of the PS4 over the same amount of time, which was remarkably popular when it launched back in 2013.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's sales had slowed down somewhat over the Christmas period, falling by around 35% compared to the original Switch during the same period. It seems, however, to have had little effect on the console's overall performance.</p>
<p>Concerns around potential price rises persist as the US grapples with tariffs and the rapid rise of AI, but overall, it seems Nintendo's new console is off to the best start we could have possibly hoped for.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Has Lost Nearly 95% of its Value in the Last Eight Years After 34% Share Price Drop due to its “Major Reset”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/</link>
            <guid>1413283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced that it would be undergoing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong> which saw the company <strong>cancel six games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake,</strong></a> delay another <strong>seven unannounced titles</strong>, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">entirely restructuring the company's whole operating model</a>.</p>



<p>To call it a 'major reset' was practically an understatement, as it wasn't just a portfolio reset, but one that will forever change how the French company operates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its share price didn't take the news well, and, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a>, the company's <strong>share price dropped by 34%.</strong></p>



<p>What's worse, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points out, is that after yesterday's major drop, the company's market cap sits around <strong>€500 million</strong>. Back in 2018, its market cap was closer to <strong>€10 billion</strong>, which means that in just the <strong>last eight years, Ubisoft has lost somewhere in the range of 95% of its value.</strong></p>







<p>At the time of this writing, the company's stock price currently sits at <strong>€4.37</strong>, marking the lowest point for its share price in over a decade, as it hasn't dropped below <strong>€5.00</strong> since 2011. When you look at these historic lows, it's understandable as to why the company's shareholders were calling for the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf"><strong>Guillemot</strong> <strong>family</strong> to be removed from leadership</a> back in 2024, and why shareholders have reportedly been looking at all options, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">including a buyout</a>, in recent years.</p>



<p>If not for <strong>Tencent</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-raise-its-stake-in-ubisoft-aims-to-become-largest-shareholder/">which has continuously raised its importance</a> within Ubisoft over the last few years, solidifying itself as a core partner for the company with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong> last year</a>, chief executive officer and co-founder <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, and the rest of his founding family might've already found themselves ousted from the company they started all the way back in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while chief financial officer <strong>Frederick Duguet</strong> did not comment on share price expectations, he emphasized that it's what the company does next that's most important, namely how it can execute its plans now that it is undertaking this "<em>major reset</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>What I can repeat is that we want to focus on execution," </em>said Duguet.<em> "It's a major reset and we want to make sure that everything we've decided will allow the Creative Houses to succeed in their specific role. And we want them to be the best in the world in each and every segment we're in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We will be also entering into a few additional segments. We mentioned that we still have four new IPs in development. But again, the market is super selective. We are on a good path to return to very high quality games, as we've seen lately, but we need to go further and we are convinced that when we do it well, then the return on investment can be exceptional. But you need to be in the top two of each and every segment.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingsman-zazzastack-marvel-rivals-black-widow-deadpool-cup-2000662244</link>
            <guid>1413262</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While in a practice match to prepare for a $40,000 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-rivals"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> tournament, content creator Kingsman265 rather insistently suggested a change in his team’s composition. The discussion sparked a series of arguments with his teammates, which escalated to the point of tournament host BasimZB giving Kingsman265 the boot from the tournament altogether.</span></p> <p><span>The tournament, held on January 18, was called Deadpool Creator Cup, and it was meant to commemorate the titular character’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>recent addition</span></a><span> to the game. The tourney grouped 48 influencers together, and while this wasn’t a professional cup, the pool was significant. First prize would net around $3,000 to each player on the winning team, divided from a total of $18,000.</span></p>

 <p><span>Kingsman has uploaded </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyKlnqgNtXs"><span>a video to his YouTube channel</span></a><span> which shows the whole situation unfold. “You may not want the money, but I do, okay? I really want to win,” Kingsman265 told his teammates at one point. “I need money for college, I need money for everything, and I want to try my hardest to get the right composition.”</span></p> <p><span>His main suggestions involved asking fellow teammate and content creator zazzastack, a known Black Widow player, to switch out the sniper for another character, as well as attempting a “triple support” composition, which basically involves having three players, basically half of the team, using healers.</span></p>

 <p><span>As the teammates argued against Kingsman265 suggestions, the streamer stopped practicing with them and went out to q</span><span>ueue for ranked matches on his own. Shortly afterward, Kingsman265 reports that the tournament host messaged him to let him know he was out.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is my decision, based on what I saw, off the clips and the VODs, and what I’ve seen from different perspectives,” BasimZB </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousFancyHareWTRuck-YvqOVi7EZ3UUKIQD"><span>said via Twitch</span></a><span>. “When you’re drafted to the team, to the moment you finish the tournament, you are part of this tournament, and you gotta play by the rules (…) there’s a level of respect that you need to have amongst your teammates, and amongst staff.”</span></p> <h2>Online harassment prompts a public apology</h2> <p><span>BasimZB went on to say that he saw and understood everything, but ultimately argued that if a player is interested in “pure competitiveness,” that person should “be a professional player” and take part in professional tournaments instead, as opposed to a creator-focused cup. The team Kingsman had been part of went on to come in seventh out of eight teams.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The video uploaded by Kingsman265 has accrued over 1 million views as of the time of publication. As </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-twitch-streamer-widow-main-tournament/"><span>noted by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, zazzastack, during the tournament stream, said that people who are coming to conclusions based solely on said video are not “fully informed” about the situation. The streamer later suggested that Kingsman265 left out parts of matches in which he “shit-talked” his teammates as well.</span></p> <p><span>Content creator Cece took it over to </span><a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> to share a lengthy apology about her behavior during the tournament as leader of the team Kingsman265 was on. In it, she says she regrets raising her voice and shutting down a teammate, as well as calling Kingsman265 a “loser,” while also saying that the heightened emotions of the situation led to these moments. Meanwhile, Zazzastack has stated that she’s been on the receiving end of harassment, with Kingsman265 fans subbing to her Twitch channel just to leave “disgusting” comments.</span></p> <p><span>Kingsman seems to be coming away from the situation pretty well, by contrast. </span><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kingsman265-is-now-making-bank-on-twitch-after-removal-from-40k-marvel-rivals-event-3308064/"><span>As noted by </span><i><span>Dexerto</span></i></a><span>, he’s amassed over 10,000 new subscribers on Twitch, and pulled in donations surpassing the amount he would have earned had he and his team won the tournament. </span><span>“I’ve already made more than the $3000 that I would have won for first place in the tournament, so stop giving me money,” he said on a recent stream.</span></p>

            <p>Tonight is the night when - after what has felt like months and months of waiting - we will finally get another look at Playground Games' Fable, thanks to the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>It isn't just the fabled Fable we will be seeing later, though, no sir! Xbox has also promised a look at the next game from Game Freak (yes, as in the Pokémon co-developer). This one is called Beast of Reincarnation, and takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, and will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>We will also get more news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>. Its release date has actually leaked ahead of this evening's presentation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">the game looking set to arrive on 19th May</a>. We can presumably expect official confirmation later.</p>
<p>We will be watching tonight's Xbox Developer Direct, and you can join us for all the fun and chat from around 5.30pm, when I will be back at my computer, probably with a cheeky G&amp;T and some posh crisps in hand.</p>

<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The new sequel, developed by Fabraz (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>) will also get a 'Pawsome Edition' physical release on both consoles, containing the game itself, a deluxe box, a poster, an artbook, and a manual. Atari is seemingly implying that, much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, the physical release on Switch 2 is <em>not</em> a Game-Key Card but rather a full on-cart release.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, a digital copy of Bubsy 4D will set you back <strong>$19.99</strong>. The physical edition on Switch is <strong>$39.99</strong>, while the release on Switch 2 is <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, I’m on a mission to take back the Golden Fleece from those nasty BaaBots who snatched it right out of my paws. I’ll run, jump, glide and roll across alien planets with platforming purrfection, tackling vibrant fabric- and craft-themed levels, with each planet ending in a BaaBot boss battle. Dress me up in stylish new outfits, collect hidden blueprints to unlock new moves and race against other players’ ghost data in online time trials. Along the way, I’ll reunite with furmiliar friends like Terri, Terry, Virgil and Oblivia - all to a pawsitively funky soundtrack by Fat Bard."</p>

<p>Bubsy has had his fair share of criticism in the past. Most recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> received a score of 4/10 from us earlier in 2025, in which we described the included games as being "frustrating and painful to play".</p>
<p>With Frbraz at the helm, however, we're confident Bubsy 4D will be much better.</p>

<p>Continuing down the top ten, Capcom's <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is in fourth place for 2025, which demonstrates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">just how strong initial sales were</a> (even if things did start to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">peter out after a few months</a>).</p><p>Fifth place goes to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, which may be a little worryingly low for Activision and Microsoft, especially since the game's biggest rival is in the top spot.</p><p>In sixth, seventh, and eighth place are three EA sports titles, namely <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>respectively, with the final two spots in the top ten taken up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="64e25692-338e-455e-b91a-4b1b51fbb682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>Hardware-wise, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the Switch 2 led the year in both unit and dollar terms; it's a new piece of Nintendo kit, after all, so there was almost no chance it was going to be outperformed by two five-year-old consoles (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-wii-u-vita-dreamcast" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91ebec60-06fa-4b54-b925-a0fb963092d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost being the operative word</a>).</p><figure role="group">

            <p>Fine, we'll let you hop in whatever the MMO equivalent of Superman's phone booth is for a single round of free outfit transmog just before the launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-releases-in-march-bringing-voidstorm-plague-on-all-the-new-houses">March's Midnight expansion</a>.

<p>This situation kicked off with the deployment of Blizzard's<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24245217"> big pre-Midnight update - 12.0.0</a> - earlier this week. As part of a transition in the MMO's transmog system, the feature that lets you slap a new visual appearance onto your character's gear while leaving it unaltered under the surface, this patch swaps out paying to apply new appearances to individual bits of gear for a system based around buying slots where you can save transmog setups for full outfits.</p><p>In theory, cutting down how much paying you have to do in order to swap your gear's look is supposed to be one of the new system's pluses. However, with this patch's arrival, folks have found themselves facing the need to pay to wear outfits they've previously paid for. How much of a pain in the bottom this is looks to depend on a number of factors, mainly the obvious stuff like how flush your character is with cash and how many alt accounts you're running at the moment.</p>
<p>Cue forum threads where wowers have shown their displeasure by making the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175000-gold/2232236">bill they're facing the main subject line</a>. Though, others argued the new system's upfront cost was manageable and would be worth it in the long run. "I’m spending 1k per outfit, I have an average of 2-3 outfits per character. I have 30 characters. I didn’t notice the spending, and I’m not even rich (I have around 1.5 million gold across all my characters)," reads <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/transmog-you-guys-are-exaggerating/2232196">a post</a> which could be read out backstage at a Paris fashion show and probably not raise any eyebrows.</p>
<p>In response, Blizzard sent out community manager Kaivax to ensure no bits of Elven jewellery or Dwarven pauldrons were thrown. "Although previously saved loadouts were converted to Custom Sets in the new system, it costs the normal amount of gold to apply the first Transmog to your character, even if you’re simply setting your appearance back to the way it was before," they <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128">wrote</a>. "This was an oversight on our part; you should have been able to maintain or reset your existing look without cost.</p>
<p>"With the 12.0.1 update before the launch of Midnight, all player-characters will be granted one free Transmog. This will be automatically applied to the next outfit created for each character. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by first-time Transmog costs." They added that the studio are also looking into making Legion Artifact appearances less limited in terms of weapons they can be applied to in that next patch.</p><p>The Midnight expansion's set to release on March 2nd, so there is a little bit of time for folks to wait until they get that free outfit change. Hey, it's more time to plan out where you're gonna stick all of your adventuring clutter in the player housing the add-on's also set to deliver.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-is-coming-and-the-s25-fe-gets-cleared-out-at-a-record-low-even-though-its-still-a-new-smartphone-2000661977</link>
            <guid>1413217</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Brace yourself for tech nerd trivia — what does the FE in Samsung’s Galaxy S25 FE stand for? It’s not a trick question like the S in Harry S. Truman’s name (which didn’t stand for anything). The answer is Fan Edition, which is apropos today because you’ll most definitely be a fan of this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6824/">limited-time Amazon deal that offers an unlocked 256GB Galaxy S25 FE for just $510, its lowest price ever</a>.</p>
<p>That “Fan Edition” tag was born when Samsung decided to add an affordable model to their new smartphone lines, and add in some requested features based on feedback from customers. In the case of the Galaxy S25 FE, that includes a lighter body comprised of an Armor Aluminum frame, but with the toughness of Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the 6.7-inch AMOLED display. The battery life has been jazzed up and given access to fast charging of up to 40W. There are more fan-friendly features built in, but none of them add to the very accessible price tag of this great smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stripped-Down Price, Not Features</h2>
<p>Samsung did not cut many corners when it came to creating this “base” model to their critically acclaimed Galaxy S25 fleet of smartphones which dropped just this past September. The exceptionally sharp AMOLED display has a crisp 120Hz refresh rate, and while the camera set isn’t on par with the elite-level one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it’s very capable. The 12MP selfie camera on the front uses Samsung’s ProVisual engine, and trio of cameras on the reverse side — a 12MP ultrawide, 8MP telephoto, and the 50MP main camera — cover all of your still and video needs.</p>
<p>Galaxy AI is built into the S25 FE, which comes in very handy for tasks above and beyond the personal-assistant needs. Photo and video editing are better and easier than ever with the AI assist, and Gemini Live is ready to join forces with the S25 FE’s camera to give you real-time answers to any form of “what is this?” question.</p>



<h2>Fantastic Free Agent</h2>
<p>The virtues of having an unlocked smartphone that you can take to any cell provider are a huge selling point for this Amazon deal. The freedom to take your smartphone anywhere without being locked into a longterm contract or years of monthly installment payments usually comes with a far bigger price tag than the $510 one attached to this unlocked 256GB Galaxy S25 FE, which will quickly pay for itself when compared to having a fat installment plan weighing down your monthly bill.</p>
<p>This limited-time Amazon deal taking 28% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is a fan edition deal on a Fan Edition smartphone, which means everybody wins. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6824/">This top-rated unlocked Android phone is just $510 if you catch this deal in time.</a></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025 in the United States. The news was broken on January 22 by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdusovdk2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana’s Mat Piscatella</a>. </p>







<p>DICE’s latest shooter might have slipped from the top spot back in November, but it managed to top the yearly charts instead. That means that in just under three months, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> had outsold every other title on the list.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26 remained firm at second place, whilst Borderlands 4 and Monster Hunter: Wilds switched positions to third and fourth respectively. Rounding out the top five was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Sports titles remain ever-popular in the US, with Madden NFL 26, EA Sports College Football 26, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports FC 26</a>, MLB: The Show 25 and WWE 2K25 all featuring in the top 20. Interestingly, some titles on the list weren’t even released in 2025, with the likes of Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto 5 proving to remain top-sellers. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder was one of Nintendo's flagship games on the original Nintendo Switch when it was released in 2023. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/every-switch-2-upgrade-from-the-september-2025-nintendo-direct-including">While its Switch 2 upgrade was announced a while ago</a>, today we got some more details about what to expect and when it's coming out. First things first: you can get the upgrade and content expansion in just over two months on March 26, and it'll cost $19.99.</p><p>Attraction Central is Bellabel Park's main sell, inviting players to a new area full of co-op and competitive minigames. The attractions are divided into two sections – local and wireless/online. The former can also be played with GameShare – meaning one Switch 2 owner can share it with nearby Switch or Switch 2 players that might not have the game – while the latter is built around players having individual screens and moving at their own paces.</p><p>Today's trailer also revealed Camp Central, a new area in the park where you can participate in the Toad Brigade Training Camp. These levels unlock as you complete stages in the main game, and give alternate challenge modes to levels you've already completed. Examples in the footage include defeating enemies, collecting coins in a time limit, and completing the level while maintaining invincibility.</p><p>Of course, Bellabel Park isn't all fun and games, and you can blame the Koopalings for that. They'll appear and scatter across the game's various worlds, and players will have to track them down, a task seemingly aided by an explorer Toad in each kingdom. We don't see much of these villainous turtles, however, because the trailer quickly pivots to the reveal that Rosalina will be playable with the update. She has no special abilities, and joins the main cast in all modes.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVB3hZoOF0A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVB3hZoOF0A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The update also adds some more accessibility options, specifically geared towards younger children. Co-Star Luma can join if there are at least two players, and can freely fly around a level. Luma can collect coins and spin to defeat enemies, but can't die, so it's ideal for someone who wants to participate but isn't coordinated enough to play. Since this is exclusive to the Switch 2 version, it also adds mouse controls for Luma, so it's even accessible to those who can't quite use a joystick. There's also a new Assist Mode which accomplishes a similar function, making players immune to damage and automatically surviving falls with a flying flower.</p><p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (man, what a long title) is out March 26 exclusively on Switch 2. If you'd like to pre-order it, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-upgrade-pack-switch-2/">you can do so here</a>.
