<figure data-uuid="a3865a73ba47d"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3865a73ba47d/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 ended 2025 with a total of <strong>4.4 million units</strong> sold in the US, according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczduu7kxc2b">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>
<p>This means that after its seventh month on the market, Nintendo's new system is still the fastest-selling home console in US history. Piscatella noted afterwards that the Game Boy Advance is the overall winner in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this means that the Switch 2's install base is nearly double that of its predecessor after the same amount of time. It's also roughly 35% ahead of the PS4 over the same amount of time, which was remarkably popular when it launched back in 2013.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's sales had slowed down somewhat over the Christmas period, falling by around 35% compared to the original Switch during the same period. It seems, however, to have had little effect on the console's overall performance.</p>
<p>Concerns around potential price rises persist as the US grapples with tariffs and the rapid rise of AI, but overall, it seems Nintendo's new console is off to the best start we could have possibly hoped for.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/</link>
            <guid>1413283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced that it would be undergoing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong> which saw the company <strong>cancel six games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake,</strong></a> delay another <strong>seven unannounced titles</strong>, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">entirely restructuring the company's whole operating model</a>.</p>



<p>To call it a 'major reset' was practically an understatement, as it wasn't just a portfolio reset, but one that will forever change how the French company operates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its share price didn't take the news well, and, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a>, the company's <strong>share price dropped by 34%.</strong></p>



<p>What's worse, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points out, is that after yesterday's major drop, the company's market cap sits around <strong>€500 million</strong>. Back in 2018, its market cap was closer to <strong>€10 billion</strong>, which means that in just the <strong>last eight years, Ubisoft has lost somewhere in the range of 95% of its value.</strong></p>







<p>At the time of this writing, the company's stock price currently sits at <strong>€4.37</strong>, marking the lowest point for its share price in over a decade, as it hasn't dropped below <strong>€5.00</strong> since 2011. When you look at these historic lows, it's understandable as to why the company's shareholders were calling for the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf"><strong>Guillemot</strong> <strong>family</strong> to be removed from leadership</a> back in 2024, and why shareholders have reportedly been looking at all options, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">including a buyout</a>, in recent years.</p>



<p>If not for <strong>Tencent</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-raise-its-stake-in-ubisoft-aims-to-become-largest-shareholder/">which has continuously raised its importance</a> within Ubisoft over the last few years, solidifying itself as a core partner for the company with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong> last year</a>, chief executive officer and co-founder <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, and the rest of his founding family might've already found themselves ousted from the company they started all the way back in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while chief financial officer <strong>Frederick Duguet</strong> did not comment on share price expectations, he emphasized that it's what the company does next that's most important, namely how it can execute its plans now that it is undertaking this "<em>major reset</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>What I can repeat is that we want to focus on execution," </em>said Duguet.<em> "It's a major reset and we want to make sure that everything we've decided will allow the Creative Houses to succeed in their specific role. And we want them to be the best in the world in each and every segment we're in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We will be also entering into a few additional segments. We mentioned that we still have four new IPs in development. But again, the market is super selective. We are on a good path to return to very high quality games, as we've seen lately, but we need to go further and we are convinced that when we do it well, then the return on investment can be exceptional. But you need to be in the top two of each and every segment.</em>"</p>

The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D will debut on January 29th, priced at $499.</p><p>That’s $20 more than the initial retail pricing of the 9800X3D, and this faster 9850X3D will feature the same 8-core / 16-thread CPU running at faster boost clocks. The boost clock on the 9850X3D is 400MHz higher than the standard 9800X3D, and it maintains the same 120-watt TDP. It’s essentially a better-binned version of the 9800X3D.</p><p>It’s still not clear exactly how much these higher boost clocks will help with PC games, and AMD has admitted that most of the benefits will be found in frequency-sensitive titles like esports games. Still, at least you won’t have to pay much more for a faster chip — that’s if you can find the 9850X3D at its retail price later this month.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/865648/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-price-release-date-announcement]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingsman-zazzastack-marvel-rivals-black-widow-deadpool-cup-2000662244</link>
            <guid>1413262</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While in a practice match to prepare for a $40,000 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-rivals"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> tournament, content creator Kingsman265 rather insistently suggested a change in his team’s composition. The discussion sparked a series of arguments with his teammates, which escalated to the point of tournament host BasimZB giving Kingsman265 the boot from the tournament altogether.</span></p> <p><span>The tournament, held on January 18, was called Deadpool Creator Cup, and it was meant to commemorate the titular character’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>recent addition</span></a><span> to the game. The tourney grouped 48 influencers together, and while this wasn’t a professional cup, the pool was significant. First prize would net around $3,000 to each player on the winning team, divided from a total of $18,000.</span></p>

 <p><span>Kingsman has uploaded </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyKlnqgNtXs"><span>a video to his YouTube channel</span></a><span> which shows the whole situation unfold. “You may not want the money, but I do, okay? I really want to win,” Kingsman265 told his teammates at one point. “I need money for college, I need money for everything, and I want to try my hardest to get the right composition.”</span></p> <p><span>His main suggestions involved asking fellow teammate and content creator zazzastack, a known Black Widow player, to switch out the sniper for another character, as well as attempting a “triple support” composition, which basically involves having three players, basically half of the team, using healers.</span></p>

 <p><span>As the teammates argued against Kingsman265 suggestions, the streamer stopped practicing with them and went out to q</span><span>ueue for ranked matches on his own. Shortly afterward, Kingsman265 reports that the tournament host messaged him to let him know he was out.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is my decision, based on what I saw, off the clips and the VODs, and what I’ve seen from different perspectives,” BasimZB </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousFancyHareWTRuck-YvqOVi7EZ3UUKIQD"><span>said via Twitch</span></a><span>. “When you’re drafted to the team, to the moment you finish the tournament, you are part of this tournament, and you gotta play by the rules (…) there’s a level of respect that you need to have amongst your teammates, and amongst staff.”</span></p> <h2>Online harassment prompts a public apology</h2> <p><span>BasimZB went on to say that he saw and understood everything, but ultimately argued that if a player is interested in “pure competitiveness,” that person should “be a professional player” and take part in professional tournaments instead, as opposed to a creator-focused cup. The team Kingsman had been part of went on to come in seventh out of eight teams.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The video uploaded by Kingsman265 has accrued over 1 million views as of the time of publication. As </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-twitch-streamer-widow-main-tournament/"><span>noted by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, zazzastack, during the tournament stream, said that people who are coming to conclusions based solely on said video are not “fully informed” about the situation. The streamer later suggested that Kingsman265 left out parts of matches in which he “shit-talked” his teammates as well.</span></p> <p><span>Content creator Cece took it over to </span><a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> to share a lengthy apology about her behavior during the tournament as leader of the team Kingsman265 was on. In it, she says she regrets raising her voice and shutting down a teammate, as well as calling Kingsman265 a “loser,” while also saying that the heightened emotions of the situation led to these moments. Meanwhile, Zazzastack has stated that she’s been on the receiving end of harassment, with Kingsman265 fans subbing to her Twitch channel just to leave “disgusting” comments.</span></p> <p><span>Kingsman seems to be coming away from the situation pretty well, by contrast. </span><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kingsman265-is-now-making-bank-on-twitch-after-removal-from-40k-marvel-rivals-event-3308064/"><span>As noted by </span><i><span>Dexerto</span></i></a><span>, he’s amassed over 10,000 new subscribers on Twitch, and pulled in donations surpassing the amount he would have earned had he and his team won the tournament. </span><span>“I’ve already made more than the $3000 that I would have won for first place in the tournament, so stop giving me money,” he said on a recent stream.</span></p>

            <p>Tonight is the night when - after what has felt like months and months of waiting - we will finally get another look at Playground Games' Fable, thanks to the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>It isn't just the fabled Fable we will be seeing later, though, no sir! Xbox has also promised a look at the next game from Game Freak (yes, as in the Pokémon co-developer). This one is called Beast of Reincarnation, and takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, and will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>We will also get more news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>. Its release date has actually leaked ahead of this evening's presentation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">the game looking set to arrive on 19th May</a>. We can presumably expect official confirmation later.</p>
<p>We will be watching tonight's Xbox Developer Direct, and you can join us for all the fun and chat from around 5.30pm, when I will be back at my computer, probably with a cheeky G&amp;T and some posh crisps in hand.</p>

<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The new sequel, developed by Fabraz (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>) will also get a 'Pawsome Edition' physical release on both consoles, containing the game itself, a deluxe box, a poster, an artbook, and a manual. Atari is seemingly implying that, much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, the physical release on Switch 2 is <em>not</em> a Game-Key Card but rather a full on-cart release.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, a digital copy of Bubsy 4D will set you back <strong>$19.99</strong>. The physical edition on Switch is <strong>$39.99</strong>, while the release on Switch 2 is <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, I’m on a mission to take back the Golden Fleece from those nasty BaaBots who snatched it right out of my paws. I’ll run, jump, glide and roll across alien planets with platforming purrfection, tackling vibrant fabric- and craft-themed levels, with each planet ending in a BaaBot boss battle. Dress me up in stylish new outfits, collect hidden blueprints to unlock new moves and race against other players’ ghost data in online time trials. Along the way, I’ll reunite with furmiliar friends like Terri, Terry, Virgil and Oblivia - all to a pawsitively funky soundtrack by Fat Bard."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bubsy has had his fair share of criticism in the past. Most recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> received a score of 4/10 from us earlier in 2025, in which we described the included games as being "frustrating and painful to play".</p>
<p>With Frbraz at the helm, however, we're confident Bubsy 4D will be much better.</p>

<p>Continuing down the top ten, Capcom's <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is in fourth place for 2025, which demonstrates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">just how strong initial sales were</a> (even if things did start to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">peter out after a few months</a>).</p><p>Fifth place goes to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, which may be a little worryingly low for Activision and Microsoft, especially since the game's biggest rival is in the top spot.</p><p>In sixth, seventh, and eighth place are three EA sports titles, namely <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>respectively, with the final two spots in the top ten taken up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="64e25692-338e-455e-b91a-4b1b51fbb682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>Hardware-wise, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the Switch 2 led the year in both unit and dollar terms; it's a new piece of Nintendo kit, after all, so there was almost no chance it was going to be outperformed by two five-year-old consoles (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-wii-u-vita-dreamcast" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91ebec60-06fa-4b54-b925-a0fb963092d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost being the operative word</a>).</p><figure role="group">

            <p>Fine, we'll let you hop in whatever the MMO equivalent of Superman's phone booth is for a single round of free outfit transmog just before the launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-releases-in-march-bringing-voidstorm-plague-on-all-the-new-houses">March's Midnight expansion</a>. So have degreed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> makers Blizzard, in the face of vocal vexation among players unhappy about a sudden hike in clothes changing prices that arrived with the game's latest patch.</p>

<p>This situation kicked off with the deployment of Blizzard's<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24245217"> big pre-Midnight update - 12.0.0</a> - earlier this week. As part of a transition in the MMO's transmog system, the feature that lets you slap a new visual appearance onto your character's gear while leaving it unaltered under the surface, this patch swaps out paying to apply new appearances to individual bits of gear for a system based around buying slots where you can save transmog setups for full outfits.</p><p>In theory, cutting down how much paying you have to do in order to swap your gear's look is supposed to be one of the new system's pluses. However, with this patch's arrival, folks have found themselves facing the need to pay to wear outfits they've previously paid for. How much of a pain in the bottom this is looks to depend on a number of factors, mainly the obvious stuff like how flush your character is with cash and how many alt accounts you're running at the moment.</p>
<p>Cue forum threads where wowers have shown their displeasure by making the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175000-gold/2232236">bill they're facing the main subject line</a>. Though, others argued the new system's upfront cost was manageable and would be worth it in the long run. "I’m spending 1k per outfit, I have an average of 2-3 outfits per character. I have 30 characters. I didn’t notice the spending, and I’m not even rich (I have around 1.5 million gold across all my characters)," reads <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/transmog-you-guys-are-exaggerating/2232196">a post</a> which could be read out backstage at a Paris fashion show and probably not raise any eyebrows.</p>
<p>In response, Blizzard sent out community manager Kaivax to ensure no bits of Elven jewellery or Dwarven pauldrons were thrown. "Although previously saved loadouts were converted to Custom Sets in the new system, it costs the normal amount of gold to apply the first Transmog to your character, even if you’re simply setting your appearance back to the way it was before," they <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128">wrote</a>. "This was an oversight on our part; you should have been able to maintain or reset your existing look without cost.</p>
<p>"With the 12.0.1 update before the launch of Midnight, all player-characters will be granted one free Transmog. This will be automatically applied to the next outfit created for each character. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by first-time Transmog costs." They added that the studio are also looking into making Legion Artifact appearances less limited in terms of weapons they can be applied to in that next patch.</p><p>The Midnight expansion's set to release on March 2nd, so there is a little bit of time for folks to wait until they get that free outfit change. Hey, it's more time to plan out where you're gonna stick all of your adventuring clutter in the player housing the add-on's also set to deliver.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-is-coming-and-the-s25-fe-gets-cleared-out-at-a-record-low-even-though-its-still-a-new-smartphone-2000661977</link>
            <guid>1413217</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Brace yourself for tech nerd trivia — what does the FE in Samsung’s Galaxy S25 FE stand for? It’s not a trick question like the S in Harry S. Truman’s name (which didn’t stand for anything). The answer is Fan Edition, which is apropos today because you’ll most definitely be a fan of this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6824/">limited-time Amazon deal that offers an unlocked 256GB Galaxy S25 FE for just $510, its lowest price ever</a>.</p>
<p>That “Fan Edition” tag was born when Samsung decided to add an affordable model to their new smartphone lines, and add in some requested features based on feedback from customers. In the case of the Galaxy S25 FE, that includes a lighter body comprised of an Armor Aluminum frame, but with the toughness of Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the 6.7-inch AMOLED display. The battery life has been jazzed up and given access to fast charging of up to 40W. There are more fan-friendly features built in, but none of them add to the very accessible price tag of this great smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stripped-Down Price, Not Features</h2>
<p>Samsung did not cut many corners when it came to creating this “base” model to their critically acclaimed Galaxy S25 fleet of smartphones which dropped just this past September. The exceptionally sharp AMOLED display has a crisp 120Hz refresh rate, and while the camera set isn’t on par with the elite-level one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it’s very capable. The 12MP selfie camera on the front uses Samsung’s ProVisual engine, and trio of cameras on the reverse side — a 12MP ultrawide, 8MP telephoto, and the 50MP main camera — cover all of your still and video needs.</p>
<p>Galaxy AI is built into the S25 FE, which comes in very handy for tasks above and beyond the personal-assistant needs. Photo and video editing are better and easier than ever with the AI assist, and Gemini Live is ready to join forces with the S25 FE’s camera to give you real-time answers to any form of “what is this?” question.</p>



<h2>Fantastic Free Agent</h2>
<p>The virtues of having an unlocked smartphone that you can take to any cell provider are a huge selling point for this Amazon deal. The freedom to take your smartphone anywhere without being locked into a longterm contract or years of monthly installment payments usually comes with a far bigger price tag than the $510 one attached to this unlocked 256GB Galaxy S25 FE, which will quickly pay for itself when compared to having a fat installment plan weighing down your monthly bill.</p>
<p>This limited-time Amazon deal taking 28% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is a fan edition deal on a Fan Edition smartphone, which means everybody wins. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6824/">This top-rated unlocked Android phone is just $510 if you catch this deal in time.</a></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025 in the United States. The news was broken on January 22 by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdusovdk2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana’s Mat Piscatella</a>. </p>







<p>DICE’s latest shooter might have slipped from the top spot back in November, but it managed to top the yearly charts instead. That means that in just under three months, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> had outsold every other title on the list.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26 remained firm at second place, whilst Borderlands 4 and Monster Hunter: Wilds switched positions to third and fourth respectively. Rounding out the top five was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Sports titles remain ever-popular in the US, with Madden NFL 26, EA Sports College Football 26, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports FC 26</a>, MLB: The Show 25 and WWE 2K25 all featuring in the top 20. Interestingly, some titles on the list weren’t even released in 2025, with the likes of Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto 5 proving to remain top-sellers. </p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/22/super-mario-bros-wonder-gets-switch-2-upgrade-playable-rosalina-and-bellabel-park-in</link>
            <guid>1413208</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder was one of Nintendo's flagship games on the original Nintendo Switch when it was released in 2023. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/every-switch-2-upgrade-from-the-september-2025-nintendo-direct-including">While its Switch 2 upgrade was announced a while ago</a>, today we got some more details about what to expect and when it's coming out. First things first: you can get the upgrade and content expansion in just over two months on March 26, and it'll cost $19.99.</p><p>Attraction Central is Bellabel Park's main sell, inviting players to a new area full of co-op and competitive minigames. The attractions are divided into two sections – local and wireless/online. The former can also be played with GameShare – meaning one Switch 2 owner can share it with nearby Switch or Switch 2 players that might not have the game – while the latter is built around players having individual screens and moving at their own paces.</p><p>Today's trailer also revealed Camp Central, a new area in the park where you can participate in the Toad Brigade Training Camp. These levels unlock as you complete stages in the main game, and give alternate challenge modes to levels you've already completed. Examples in the footage include defeating enemies, collecting coins in a time limit, and completing the level while maintaining invincibility.</p><p>Of course, Bellabel Park isn't all fun and games, and you can blame the Koopalings for that. They'll appear and scatter across the game's various worlds, and players will have to track them down, a task seemingly aided by an explorer Toad in each kingdom. We don't see much of these villainous turtles, however, because the trailer quickly pivots to the reveal that Rosalina will be playable with the update. She has no special abilities, and joins the main cast in all modes.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVB3hZoOF0A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVB3hZoOF0A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The update also adds some more accessibility options, specifically geared towards younger children. Co-Star Luma can join if there are at least two players, and can freely fly around a level. Luma can collect coins and spin to defeat enemies, but can't die, so it's ideal for someone who wants to participate but isn't coordinated enough to play. Since this is exclusive to the Switch 2 version, it also adds mouse controls for Luma, so it's even accessible to those who can't quite use a joystick. There's also a new Assist Mode which accomplishes a similar function, making players immune to damage and automatically surviving falls with a flying flower.</p><p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (man, what a long title) is out March 26 exclusively on Switch 2. If you'd like to pre-order it, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-upgrade-pack-switch-2/">you can do so here</a>.

		<p>Nintendo has revealed everything that will feature in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and confirmed that it will launch on 26th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="More fun is coming to the Flower Kingdom March 26th! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LgNT3oIw6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Continuing their trend of making their game titles ludicrously long, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park” will arrive with a bunch of added content for the hit 2D platformer.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>Starting with Bellabel Park, there’s two main plazas to explore with different gameplay offerings. The local multiplayer plaza features 17 co-op and competitive multiplayer games to try out, with up to four players able to take part, whether on a single console or through GameShare. The Game Room Plaza takes things even further with online and local wireless play and six different attractions. These are more ghost races, with up to eight players locally and twelve online.</p>

<p>The Toad Brigade is also found in Bellabel Park at Camp Central, giving you challenges to revisit the main adventure and, for example, race to collect all the coins in a level before time runs out. These can be played in 4 player co-op on one console. You’ll earn patches and rank up as you complete more challenges.</p>
<p>But there’s more! The Koopalings have returned and stolen the Bellabel flowers, spreading them across the Flower Kingdom and forcing you to go, track down the Koopalings and fight them.</p>
<p>Joining the platforming adventure is Rosalina for the first time, playable in both the main game and through Bellabel Park. Luma is also here, as a second player co-player, able to fly around, collect coins and spin attack at enemies – you can also use mouse controls for this. That’s alongside a new assist mode, which will stop you from taking damage and give you a propeller flower if you fall down a pit.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty significant expansion for the game, that’s for sure, and can be bought physically as a new release, or digitally with an upgrade available for existing owners.</p>
<p>I loved it with its original release. giving it a massive &lt;a href=”https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/”&gt;9/10&lt;/a&gt;, and saying, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder puts a fresh new spin on the classic Mario side-scroller with wild and trippy level transformations. It’s still Mario at its core, but it’s fun not knowing what to expect from each level. This could be the start of a bright new era for 2D Mario games.”</p>

            <guid>1413187</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nacon and Spiders have confirmed the full release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/greedfall-the-dying-world">GreedFall: The Dying World</a>, the game exiting early access and launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall: The Dying World | Release Date Trailer (Gameplay Overview)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWuflAxciDE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new gameplay overview trailer runs through how the game has been designed, with a rich narrative to weave around your character, who has been ripped from the new world and taken back to the old, the companions that you can recruit, a look at the combat, and the blend of weapon and magical combat.</p>
<p>A good chunk of this is rather different to the original. GreedFall: The Dying World is a prequel to the first game, casting you as a Teer Fradee native, seeing how the colonial invaders are weaselling their corrupting ways into the land, before being whisked away from your home. A major difference is with the combat, which changes from an action RPG approach to the tactical pause style.</p>

<p>We recently had the chance to go hands on with an updated version of the game, and Steve came away much more intrigued than with his first attempt. He said, “All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.”</p>

<p>Kiki's Bakery Service</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Silver Lining Interactive and developer Sunny Lab are bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchs-bakery">The Witch's Bakery</a> to Switch 2 in addition <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witchs_bakery">to Switch</a>, with the cosy RPG arriving on both consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine opening a bakery in modern-day Paris — not easy, right? Well, as Lunne the witch, that's exactly what you're doing. But this slice-of-life adventure is more than just making Mont Blancs and macarons; being a witch, Lunne has the ability to see inside people's hearts and heal their emotions. Anyone getting some <strong>Kiki's Delivery Service</strong> vibes from the premise alone?</p>
<p>The game is split into three parts — during the day, you're running your bakery, fulfilling customer requests and managing a small group of staff. In the evening, you get to explore Paris, make friends, and also solve problems by using Lunne's aforementioned magical ability. At night, you can decorate your bakery, practise your magic skills, or just relax.</p>
<p>And all of these activities get your experience and money, as well as build relationships and make new friends. But Paris is also home to many shops and unique districts, so make sure you spend time running around the most beautiful city in the world.</p>

<p>And goodness, somehow we haven't talked about the beautiful hand-drawn visuals yet: The Witch's Bakery looks gorgeous, with 2D character models that look like they've come straight out of an anime on 3D-esque backdrops. Paris has never looked more stunning, we think.</p>
<p>In addition to a digital release, Silver Lining has also confirmed it will be releasing a physical version for both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — the latter appears to be a Game-Key Card — for <strong>£29.99 / $34.99 / €34.99</strong>. Pre-orders are opening now <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/search?q=the+witch%27s+bakery&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">on Silver Lining Direct</a>.</p>
<p>We know there's a lot of cosy games on Nintendo's consoles, but the visuals and unique mix of gameplay elements make The Witch's Bakery stand out to us. It looks lovely, and we can't wait to see more later in the year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 was the Best-Selling Game in the US for 2025, While Subscription Spending and Mobile Drove 1.4% Growth]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director and video game industry analyst <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has published the final report for video game software and hardware sales in the US for 2025, and all of the work that <strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> put in last year seemingly paid off, because <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was the <strong>best-selling game in the US in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>It officially beat <strong>Call of Duty</strong> on the sales front, a feat that many doubted Battlefield could accomplish. Everyone thought it would give Call of Duty a good deal of competition, but hardly anyone (<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">save for <strong>Mike Ybarra</strong>, who, to his credit, called this outcome back in August 2025</a>) thought that Battlefield 6 would have the juice to really squeeze out Call of Duty on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Even with <strong>Black Ops 7</strong> coming out on top for the monthly sales for December 2025, it was still only able to reach fifth place overall for 2025 premium sales. <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">despite its performance struggles on PC</a>, had a strong enough launch that it was able to hold onto fourth place for the year. <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, another game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/">had performance issues at launch,</a> came in at third place, and <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> fell behind Battlefield 6 at second place.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the software charts for the year are <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong>, which is the only other non-shooter or annual sports game to make the top-10 alongside Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong> just missed joining them as it fell to eleventh place on the year, but even that still shows how well <strong>Sucker Punch's</strong> latest was received. Lastly, we'd be remiss to not point out that, once again, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> was one of the best-selling games of the year, barely making the top charts in the number 20 spot.  </p>







<p>Strong as these software sales were, they were not what drove the US video game market to grow <strong>1.4%</strong> compared to 2024, with the market reaching <strong>$60.7 billion in 2025.</strong> That growth, according to Piscatella, came from <strong>mobile games</strong> and spending on<strong> hardware</strong>, namely the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, and <strong>subscription services</strong>.</p>



<p>But, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczexudooc2v">as Piscatella notes in a separate post</a>, the increased spending wasn't necessarily driven by the number of people spending money on video games going up, but rather the price of everything, including subscription services, going up.</p>



<p>On the hardware side, the Nintendo Switch 2 was unsurprisingly the best-selling console in the US for 2025, reaching <strong>4.4 million units sold</strong> in the US for the year. <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> came behind the Switch 2 in second place for the year.</p>

It shares some functionality with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock</a>, but the Talking Flower seems more like a talkative companion for fans of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros.

There’s music, too, and at launch it will support 11 different languages including English, Italian, and Japanese.</p><p>You can also set the Talking Flower to speak at specific times of day, such as greeting you in the morning or saying good night as you head to bed, and some of its random phrases are only triggered at specific times of the day.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-s2-ep6-super-mutant-character-name-2000662226</link>
            <guid>1413160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">latest episode of </a></span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season 2 unveiled a very neat surprise for longtime fans of the franchise. If you’ve yet to see it for yourself and want to preserve the mystery, this is your first and final warning to avoid reading this article and half of the internet.</span></p> <p><span>People are already <strong>spoiling</strong> episode six’s big reveal across social media, but, in truth, it’s more of a half-reveal. There’s a lot to unpack here, so for everyone who’s already caught up, let’s get started.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136"><span>So, Ron Perlman is finally in </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i></a><span>. He was spotted at the Los Angeles premiere back in December, he “no comment”-ed his way out of confirming his appearance in the show during FAN EXPO Canada in August last year, and his very distinctive voice could clearly be heard in the first official trailer for season two, so we all knew this was coming.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real surprise is who Ron Perlman is playing: a Super Mutant. While his stature and gravelly voice lend themselves to the role, the part that’s befuddling fans is the vague nature of his character’s actual identity. The fact that there’s no name listed anywhere for Perlman’s character (be that in the episode itself, its credits, Amazon Prime’s x-ray feature, or even </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36116508/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_2_cdt_epp_sm_1"><span>on IMDb</span></a><span>) implies that there might be some sort of big reveal in store for his identity later in the show.</span></p> <p><span>That could mean one of two things: said character has already shown up in a previous episode (in a human form), or it’s an existing character from the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> games.</span></p>

 <p><span>If it’s the former, I think there are only two possibilities: Ron Perlman’s character is either Cooper Howard’s wife, Bard Howard, or his daughter, Janey. We saw a glimpse of their cryo pods in a previous episode, but we didn’t see their contents, so there’s certainly a chance (especially considering Barb seems to be involved with the Enclave). However, since Ron Perlmutant didn’t acknowledge any relation to Cooper in their meeting, this doesn’t seem too likely to me. Also, and more importantly, it would be far less entertaining to theorize about, so let’s put a pin in that for now.</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, let’s break down the likelihood of Perlman’s character being from a previous </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game and the evidence to support each of the potential characters he might be. I’m basing these hypothetical characters off of the ones listed </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1qituva/so_who_do_we_think_this_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>in this thread</span></a><span> over on the r/Fotv subreddit, but I’ve also thrown in one of my own at the end (that I haven’t seen anyone else mention yet).</span></p> <h2><b>Marcus</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662229"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662229">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Let’s start with the most popular choice: Marcus, the 200-ish-year-old Super Mutant who first appeared in </span><i><span>Fallout 2</span></i><span>. Marcus is an easy pick for several reasons.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Firstly, we know he’s kicking about in the Mojave Wasteland, as he popped up in </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> as the mayor of Jacobstown. He also helped found Broken Hills, the New California refuge for Super Mutants, ghouls, and everything in between. Perlman’s character referenced a similar outlook on ghoul/Super Mutant cooperation (Cooper-ation?) in his conversation with Cooper.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are two big issues with this theory, however. Marcus has a very visually distinct design from other Super Mutants, which Perlman’s character lacks: huge boil-like bumps that cover the entire left side of his face. He’s also voiced by Michael Dorn, of </span><i><span>Star Trek</span></i><span> fame, in both </span><i><span>Fallout 2 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>. I think the chances of the showrunners not bringing Dorn in to play Marcus in the live-action adaptation are extremely low, given how beloved his performance is.</span></p> <h2><b>Mean Sonofabitch</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662235" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662235"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662235">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>We can apply a lot of the same logic from the Marcus theory to Mean Sonofabitch, the fan-favorite Super Mutant from </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>. He’s extremely friendly, he’s been around long enough that he’s aware of the Enclave’s history, and he was last spotted in Jacobstown.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, even though it would be really, really funny if Ron Perlman were playing a guy called Mean Sonofabitch, the character’s speech impediment gets in the way of things here. Mean Sonofabitch’s tongue was cut out by a band of Super Mutant xenophobes over a decade before you meet him in</span><i><span> New Vegas</span></i><span>, and, in spite of his FEV-accelerated health regeneration, never properly healed. His speech impediment is permanent, and Perlman’s character doesn’t have one. Besides, what would be the point of changing the most distinct thing about such a fan-favorite character?</span></p>

 <h2><b>Neil</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662234"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662234">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Again, </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> Neil qualifies for all the same reasons that Marcus and Mean Sonofabitch do. Friendly, clever, formerly hail from Unity, and now reside in Jacobstown. However, unlike Marcus and Mean Sonofabitch, I don’t really have any evidence against him being Perlman’s character.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Perlman’s character and Neil share something in common; they’re both seemingly a little more violent than your standard first-generation Super Mutant. Well, it actually might be more accurate to say that they’re a bit more violent than the other first-generation Super Mutants that don’t immediately kill non-Super Mutants on sight. The only true evidence I can give against Neil being Perlman’s character is Perlmutant’s lack of mouth straps. The canon is somewhat vague on the necessity of mouth straps, but (according to the Fallout Bible) some Super Mutants sport them because their upper lips are too heavy. This small detail aside, the Neil theory’s odds look half-decent to me.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Frank Horrigan</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662233"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662233">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you finally dispatch Frank Horrigan at the end of </span><i><span>Fallout 2</span></i><span>, his chest bursts open. Then he’s bisected at the waist. Then the pneumatic pressure caused by his suit malfunctioning separates his head from his torso. </span><i><span>Then </span></i><span>his corpse is consumed by a nuclear explosion.</span></p> <p><span>If Perlman is Frank Horrigan, I will livestream myself consuming a bloatfly slider.</span></p> <h2><b>Fawkes</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662236"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662236">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Fawkes is definitely a dark horse pick here, because there’s no real evidence to support his potential link to Perlman’s character. They’re both Super Mutants, and that’s where the theory starts and ends.</span></p> <p><span>However, there is one small, possible link here. Fawkes outright tells you in </span><i><span>Fallout 3</span></i><span> that his mind has begun to degrade over the years, and that he cannot remember who he used to be prior to his FEV exposure. It’s a stretch, sure, but perhaps this lack of an exact history makes him the perfect candidate for Perlman’s character, as it would give the writers something to work with (and not upset the canon enthusiasts in the process).</span></p>

 <h2><b>Rust King</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662228"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662228">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Here’s an interesting one: </span><i><span>Fallout 76’s </span></i><span>Rust King, a Super Mutant warlord and the main antagonist of the </span><i><span>Burning Springs</span></i><span> expansion.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re not familiar with the Rust King, then don’t worry– neither am I. That being said, after seeing this suggestion </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1qituva/comment/o0wtuex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>in the r/Fotc subreddit</span></a><span>, I’m partially convinced by it. For starters, Cooper Howard is introduced in the same </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>update that the Rust King is, and even tasks you with taking him down. The Rust King also has a nasty history with the Enclave, as he was once their prisoner. Plus, when you meet him, the Rust King states that he doesn’t have a problem with ghouls or humans, as long as they can help him to further his goals.</span></p> <p><span>Now, you might be thinking, if the Rust King and Cooper are enemies, surely Perlman’s character would have recognized him in the TV series. Funny explanation for that one: they never meet in </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span>, or at least haven’t so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The Vault Dweller</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662232" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662232"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662232">Interplay</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Hear me out, because this one is an original theory from yours truly. I know it sounds far-fetched, but I think there’s a genuine possibility that the Vault Dweller, the first protagonist in </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>history, and Perlman’s character may be one and the same.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are a million and one canon reasons as to why this one might not be true. For starters, the Vault Dweller is dead. That’s according to the intro of </span><i><span>Fallout 2</span></i><span>, which states that “he lived out the rest of his years” after founding the settlement Arroyo. That’s fifty-ish years before the events of the </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>TV adaptation.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Thanks to the Vault Dweller’s memoirs, a diary written by the Vault Dweller that’s included in </span><i><span>Fallout 2’s </span></i><span>instruction manual, we also know the exact canon choices he made during the events of the first game. This includes the ending where the Vault Dweller destroys the Master’s base and the FEV vats that it housed. Unfortunately (for my theory, at least), this means that the “Dipping” ending, in which the Vault Dweller willingly turns themselves into a Super Mutant, is non-canon.</span></p> <p><span>So why do I think there’s a chance that the Vault Dweller and Perlman might be the same person? It’s mostly circumstantial, but there’s enough here that I think it’s worth entertaining.</span></p>

 <p><span>To begin with, the bit about him living “out the rest of his years” is vague enough that I think we can ignore it. At the very least, I could easily justify it as him living out the rest of his </span><i><span>human </span></i><span>years. He also, oddly, refuses to detail his encounter with the Master, merely stating that he couldn’t bring himself “to write of this discovery.” Even stranger still, he finishes his memoirs by implying that certain details within it could be false. “That is my story, and I am sticking to it,” he writes at the memoir’s conclusion.</span></p> <p><span>Perlman’s character drags Cooper to a literal church. The followers of Unity, the Master’s mutant cult, go by the name the Children of the Cathedral and operate out of a church called the Cathedral.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The followers also don bright purple robes. “Walking among the misshapen ones, I killed one of their servants and took his clothing,” states the Vault Dweller in his memoir. Perlman’s character wears a robe that looks suspiciously similar to these, except they’re black. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that they could have darkened over the decades he’s worn them.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, I’m not saying that the ending in which the Vault Dweller dips himself in FEV is canon. The events of </span><i><span>Fallout 2 </span></i><span>and every <em>Fallout</em> game beyond it confirm that it’s not. But what if he sought out the FEV in his later years? What if, in that conversation that he refuses to elaborate on, the Vault Dweller came around to the Master’s way of thinking? After all, there are dialogue paths during the Vault Dweller’s conversation with the Master that allow you to entertain (and even partially agree with) his philosophy on forced human evolution, yet ultimately still decide to oppose him.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The Vault Dweller even states in his own memoirs that he’d changed after this point: “I screamed. I cried. Slowly I came to realize that the Overseer may have been correct. I had changed. Life outside the Vault was different, and now I, too, was different.”</span></p> <p><span>Ron Perlman has been with</span><i><span> Fallout </span></i><span>since its inception. He’s narrated almost every intro and every ending slideshow in every canon </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game. What if he’s not just some faceless, unknown narrator, but instead…the very first protagonist of the entire series, recounting the history of the Wasteland through the eyes of a near-immortal Super Mutant body? Just a fun thought. It’s probably that Rust King guy, though.</span></p>

              <p>Despite being a huge critical and theatrical hit in 2025, Ryan Coogler’s stunning horror movie <em>Sinners</em> somehow left the Golden Globes without recognition for its acting or directing. However, it looks like Hollywood has an opportunity to redeem itself: the film has just received a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations, including nods in most of the top-tier categories.</p> <p><em>Sinners</em>, one of the smartest horror movies ever made, tells the story of identical twin brothers Elijah (Smoke) and Elias (Stack) Moore (both Michael B. Jordan), a pair of WWI vets and criminals returning to their hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi in 1932 after seven years of robbing the mob in Chicago. In the Jim Crow South, the brothers buy an abandoned sawmill and open it as a jazz joint for the Black population of the town, but find themselves and their club entwined in some deeply complex supernatural shenanigans that involve Robert Johnson-like blues abilities, vampires and vampire hunters, and the all-too real horror of the Ku Klux Klan. It’s a breathtaking work from the <em>Black Panther</em> director, and despite its Golden Globes snubbing it looks far better set to receive the awards it deserves from the Academy.</p>

 <p><em>Sinners</em> was nominated for seven Golden Globes, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay in the Drama category, but won not a single one of them. It did come away with gongs for Best Original Score and the peculiar booby prize of Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. (Deserved, of course, given it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/sinners-box-office-original-live-action-200-million-1851780478">the first original movie to make over $200 million domestically since 2017</a>.)</p> <p>When it comes to March 15’s Academy Awards, the prospects are looking far better. No film has ever received 16 Oscar nominations before, indicating judges are already pretty enamored. Here’s the full list of&nbsp;<em>Sinners</em>‘ nominations:</p>

 <ul> <li>Best Actor in a Leading Role – Michael B. Jordan</li> <li>Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Delroy Lindo</li> <li>Best Actress in a Supporting Role – Wunmi Mosaku</li> <li>Best Casting – Francine Maisler</li> <li>Best Cinematography – Autumn Durald Arkapaw</li> <li>Best Costume Design – Ruth E. Carter</li> <li>Best Directing – Ryan Coogler</li> <li>Best Film Editing – Michael P. Shawver</li> <li>Best Makeup and Hairstyling – Ken Diaz, Mike Fontaine and Shunika Terry</li> <li>Best Original Score – Ludwig Goransson</li> <li>Best Original Screenplay – Ryan Coogler</li> <li>Best Original Song – ‘I Lied To You’, Raphel Saadiq and Ludwig Goransson</li> <li>Best Picture – Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian and Ryan Coogler</li> <li>Best Production Design – Hannah Beachler and Monique Champagne</li> <li>Best Sound – Chris Welcker et al</li> <li>Best Visual Effects – Michael Ralla et al</li> </ul> <p>Competition remains stiff at the 98th Academy Awards, and the list of Best Picture nominations gives you the best idea of the movies that could pip&nbsp;<em>Sinners</em> at the post:</p> <ul> <li><em>Bugonia</em></li> <li><em>F1</em></li> <li><em>Frankenstein</em></li> <li><em>Hamnet</em></li> <li><em>Marty Supreme</em></li> <li><em>One Battle After Another</em></li> <li><em>The Secret Agent</em></li> <li><em>Sentimental Value</em></li> <li><em>Sinners</em></li> <li><em>Train Dreams</em></li> </ul> <p>It’s a very pleasingly eclectic list, and it’s likely that Timothée Chalamet could spoil Michael B. Jordan’s chances for Best Actor, given the Oscars’ reputation for&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>many factors, such as recency bias, an aversion to so-called “genre” films, and the fact that the Academy really seems to struggle with giving trophies to non-white actors.&nbsp;<em>Marty Supreme</em> and&nbsp;<em>One Battle After Another</em> seem the most likely rivals in the list.</p>

 <p>Horror movies, like anything that’s not a straight-laced drama, do have a far harder time getting deserved acclamation, so even setting this record for the most nominations&nbsp; is already a huge achievement. That it’s been achieved by a Black-led movie from a Black director with a predominantly Black cast makes it even more so. Could this finally be the year when the Oscars are not quite so white?</p>

<p>You might have to clap clap for YAPYAP when all is said and done in 2026. It has the potential to be one of the year’s big multiplayer titles, and you’ll be kicking yourself if you weren’t on board with YAPYAP’s release date sooner.</p>



<p>Joining a hype train halfway through is fun, but it’s better when you’re seated from the start. YAPYAP could be <em>that</em> game, and follow in the footsteps of memorable 2025 indie multiplayer hits like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-collaboration-fortnite-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> and Peak.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-yapyap-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is YAPYAP Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s throwing everything into the pot. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>February 3 is the confirmed release date for YAPYAP, and it follows the success of the demo.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, YAPYAP has been in existence for a while, and many have already tried out its co-op carnage via a free Steam demo. The testing and trialing are over now, as it’s time for YAPYAP’s full release date.</p>



<p>The official announcement arrived on January 19, when Maison Bap had a message for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3834090/view/217994805837303225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hey everyone! We’re happy to announce that&nbsp;YAPYAP officially launches on February 3rd&nbsp;Thank you to everyone who took the time to play the demo. The feedback we received was invaluable and allowed us to make significant improvements across the entire game, refining systems, fixing rough edges, and expanding on what worked best.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-is-yapyap">What Is YAPYAP?</h2>



<p><strong>Maison Bap’s YAPYAP is a multiplayer game that blends teamwork, horror, and all-around silliness to create another entry in the popular online co-op genre.</strong></p>



<p>Now, you can play YAPYAP by yourself, but these games are always better with someone else to shout at or BE shouted at by—we’re all friends here. Among Us and Lethal Company really popularized this genre of people working together online, invading a location, grabbing resources, or recording footage, and trying to get them out while avoiding monsters.</p>



<p>YAPYAP is just that, only this time, you can all cast spells by actually saying them out loud into your microphone. You can create projectiles, turn your friends into tiny people, use Crystal Balls to guide your way, and literally fly around the castle.</p>



<p>Think of Harry Potter, only Harry, Hermione, and Ron remain unruly children forever and intend to cause as much mayhem as possible.</p>



<p>Check out the full launch trailer right here.</p>
