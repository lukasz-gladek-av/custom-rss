            <p>The Maw has once again eaten Edwin. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">After spending a few days in the news beast's digestive tract back in October</a>, Edwin did implement fresh safety protocols. No petting The Maw. Only feed The Maw using a standard issue six foot news pole. All teeth cleaning must be performed by a qualified animal dentist with a certificate in eldritch care. Sadly, the CCTV camera shows Edwin was fooled by The Maw's gurgles, which sounded suspiciously like 'Can I tell you a secret?'. Edwin proffered his ear, and the cost of his curiosity was to be swallowed whole. We believe he will climb out of the creature's gullet in time to cover The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the proper traditions were observed. Mark played The Last Post on his kazoo, James wiped out the '56' on the 'Days since last accident' whiteboard in the coffee room, and wrote in a '0'. There was a respectful silence, only interrupted by the microwave ping when my porridge was done.</p>
<p>Things should be quietening down as we approach Christmas. That said, there are still some great games on the docket this week.</p>
<h2>Monday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a> sees you trying to earn your freedom from the Underworld by skating all the way to the moon. The main issue is you're made of glass, any slips on the way are mighty deadly.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a> is the fleshed out and expanded version of the prequel to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios infamous Yakuza series. First released on PC in 2018, this embiggened version includes a Red Light Raid multiplayer mode.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597880/Cat_Named_Mojave/">Cat Named Mojave</a> is ideal for anyone who spent last week playing Horses and decided they need a touch more animal-headed, human-bodied horror in their lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3604260/Liminal_City/">Liminal City</a> is for people who played Horses and thought, I would like a nice horror game with no people in at all, please-and-thank-you. (Spider-like creatures that chase you through car parks are, however, in attendance.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/">Death Howl</a> is leaning hard into its deck-building, soulslike genre blending, even putting <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2825880/extras/3133a8ee09c772e865609fe30bbd0a99.avif?t=1765188528">a chart on its Steam Page</a> detailing how it satisfies the criteria of both. Buzz words aside, it looks to be a stylish descent into a wasteland filled with eldritch horrors.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582980/Milanos_Odd_Job_Collection/">Milano's Odd Job Collection</a> is the localised release of Milano no Arubaito, first released in Japan in 1999. If you ever wanted to recreate the experience of childhood labour exploitation, you can earn summer money as a 11-year-old Milano as she steps into the shoes of a fruit picker, nurse, and delivery driver.</li>
<li>Set in a world where music is outlawed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is a rhythm action game where you put on illegal gigs and smash the state. We'll have a review later this week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350190/Anxiety_Puppy/">Anxiety Puppy</a> is a visual novel about dealing with the mounting daily anxieties of living in a city. I'm not sure about the developers' claim that this is a unique theme in gaming, but I'm all for people looking for ways to represent mental health.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">Ashes of Creation</a> will be opening its MMO world up to early access players this week. The developers are stressing that it will be an alpha world and expect frequent, significant changes to its world. Still, with the ambition to create a world where you can trade, capture, or defend player-developed settlements, it could be a good game to explore in its early days.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>In an appropriate disregard for canonical history, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718460/Terminator_2D_NO_FATE/">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is a pixel-art game set in and around the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day which ignores the 8-bit movie tie-in game released on the NES and Master System in 1992. Still, 90s game never came to PC, so it may as well not exist – as much fun as riding a motorbike through the LA canals and shooting locks off chainlink gates may have been. The new game recreates scenes from the film and invents new events that took place in the margins of the action. It's basically the Terminator equivalent of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</p>
<p>While this is a comparatively quiet week for releases. If you're a news glutton similar to our fine Maw, look forward to a veritable feast of stories from tomorrow's Wholesome Snack and Thursday night's Game Awards.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AirPods 4 Are Now Cheaper Than Renewed Models at 45% Off as Apple Continues Its Clearance Push]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-are-now-cheaper-than-renewed-models-at-45-off-as-apple-continues-its-clearance-push-2000651052</link>
            <guid>1375948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="157" data-end="888">Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean all the best discounts have disappeared with them. In fact, one of the strongest lingering deals right now is on the Apple AirPods 4. Even though these earbuds are just over a year old, they’re getting a surprisingly steep price cut—making this an ideal moment to grab a pair if you’ve been waiting for a sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">The ANC-enabled AirPods 4 launched at $179, but Amazon currently has them marked down 45%, bringing the price to just $99</a>. That’s a staggering $80 off the original cost. If you prefer add on AppleCare+, the version packed with Apple’s coverage is also discounted down to just $118 (down from $208).</p>
<p data-start="890" data-end="1292">AirPods have been a staple in Apple’s lineup for years, and each generation sees subtle but meaningful refinements. The newest AirPods 4 introduce a sleeker shape with a shorter stem and intuitive quick-press controls for managing your audio. Apple has put an emphasis on all-day comfort in this redesign, aiming to make them easier to wear for longer stretches—whether you’re commuting, working, or relaxing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1294" data-end="1311">Isolate Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1313" data-end="1686">One of the biggest upgrades comes from Apple’s H2 chip, which significantly improves call quality. The chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly, even in loud or crowded environments. Instead of competing with chatter, engine noise, or street sounds, your voice remains front and center.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">That same H2 chip enhances your listening experience as well. Apple’s updated acoustic architecture is designed to deliver richer audio, offering detailed highs and deeper bass for music, podcasts, and videos. The improvements make everyday listening feel more dynamic and polished.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">With active noise cancellation, you can reduce unwanted background noise so you can focus solely on your entertainment or phone call. The H2 chip allows the AirPods 4 to blend together ANC and Transparency Mode. If you start speaking with someone nearby, the AirPods 4 can automatically adjust the volume of what’s playing so you can hold a conversation.</p>


<p data-start="1972" data-end="2365">Another enhancement is the new interaction capabilities with Siri—Apple’s voice assistant. The AirPods 4 can interpret simple head gestures like nodding yes or shaking your head noas responses to Siri’s questions. It’s a futuristic touch, though I’m not sure which is weirder. Someone sitting across from you seeing you blankly nodding and shaking your head, or deadpan whispering “yes” or “no” to seemingly nobody.</p>
<p data-start="2367" data-end="2703">One immediately noticeable change from the previous generation is the charging port. Apple has finally moved away from the proprietary Lightning connector. The AirPods 4 charging case now uses USB-C, aligning with the broader industry standard and making charging more convenient if you already have USB-C cables for your other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2705" data-end="2995" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday now behind us, it is a pleasant surprise to see a deal this strong still available—especially on a newer Apple product.</a> If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your earbuds, the ongoing discount on the AirPods 4 is worth taking advantage of while it lasts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It's no secret that some of the greatest minds in Japanese game development like to get together to break bread (or knock back a beer or two), but this particular meeting is especially impressive.

<p>Just imagine the kinds of conversations these guys have while sipping back a few beverages! It's enough to make us extremely jealous. How we'd love to be a fly on the wall at these get togethers...</p>
<p>For Sakurai in particular, this will no doubt be one of few instances in which the creator has actually taken some time away from his busy schedule. In addition to creating Kirby Air Riders for the Switch 2, Sakurai also produced dozens of YouTube videos focused on the art of creating games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mikami is hard at work at his new development studio Kamuy Inc., Ueda is working on the untitled 'Project Robot' game, and Suda51 is putting the finishing touches on the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>.</p>

<p>The announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from his personal YouTube channel</a>, where Cain regularly posts videos about the games industry as a whole. The Fallout creator had gone into 'semi-retirement' in June 2020, after nine years as a full-time employee of Obsidian, during which he worked on South Park: The Stick of Truth, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a> as a programmer, and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> as its co-director alongside Leonard Boyarsky (whom he previously worked with on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines). Cain also contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which launched just two months ago, but only as a creative consultant.</p>



<p>Now, however, it seems like his early retirement is over, and he's also moved back to Southern California to work in-person at the studio:</p>



<p><em>I should point out that I'm back at Obsidian. I'm their full-time employee and in person, so not remote. I'm not a contractor anymore. This means that I'm not working in other places, although there's at least one game that I worked on that I know is going to ship. I don't know if it'll be next year or the year after, but a game's going to come out that's not an Obsidian game. They'll have my name in the credits because I did work for it for it. There are other games I worked on. I'm not sure they're going to ship. The 2020 to 2025 was a weird time in the industry and a lot of games got started and a lot of games got cancelled. So, I really don't know the status of all the games that I contracted on.</em></p>



<p><em>I also can't talk about the project I'm working on at Obsidian just because, you know, that's covered under NDA. Don't bother guessing. You're not going to guess right.</em></p>



<p>A recent rumor shared by former Obsidian founder Chris Avellone <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the studio may not be planning to make a new The Outer Worlds entry, at least for now. That, coupled with the return of Cain, is more than enough to get Fallout: New Vegas fans hyped about the possibility of seeing him team up once more with Leonard Boyarsky (who also worked on the first two Fallout titles) on New Vegas 2 or another Fallout spin-off. However, Cain's tease that fans won't guess right appears to be a nudge that the project is actually a new IP.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's certainly great news that such an esteemed RPG designer, whose credits also include cult classics like Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and The Temple of Elemental Evil (which is about to be re-released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3843520/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, by the way), is back at work on new projects. Obsidian has the ambitious goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-wont-chase-huge-profits-or-grow-aggressively-plans-to-last-100-years-in-the-rpg-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to make great RPGs for the next 100 years</a> without chasing big profits or turning into a massive studio, and Cain's presence will help keep them on the right course.</p>



<p>The team is also looking to satisfy people's hunger for deeper RPGs, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-want-deeper-rpgs-says-the-outer-worlds-2-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while ago by the director of The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and the return of the original Fallout creator will undoubtedly be a boon to that end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Veteran game developer Katsuhiro Harada has announced his departure from Bandai Namco after working on the Tekken franchise for 30 years. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tekken-8-producer-provides-a-character-breakdown-for-fahkumram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tekken franchise</a> has long been one of the pillars of the fighting game genre, and Katsuhiro Harada has been at the heart of it. His goodbye marks the end of an era for the Tekken, but the Tekken 8 team has been quick to shut down any fan concerns regarding the departure of their studio director.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-bandai-namco-after-30-years">Katsuhiro Harada Leaves Bandai Namco After 30 Years</h2>



<p>Harada confirmed his departure in a statement shared online, explaining that the decision came after a period of personal and professional loss. He revealed that the “loss of several close friends” and watching senior colleagues retire or pass away pushed him to reflect deeply on “the time [he] has left as a creator.” After decades spent shaping the world, characters, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anna-williams-tekken-3-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legacy of Tekken</a>, he felt the moment was right to close this chapter.</p>



<p>His message also looked back on his early days at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-bandai-namco-partnership-billion-yen-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco</a>, recalling humble beginnings at local Japanese arcade tournaments and tracing his journey through the studio’s growth and Tekken’s global rise. He thanked fans for their unwavering support and noted that he will share details about his future plans in due course.</p>







<p>You can read his full statement below.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><p>My roots lie…</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In response to his announcement, the <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tekken development team</a> issued their own statement, assuring players that Harada’s departure will not impact Tekken 8’s ongoing development or post-launch roadmap. They emphasised their commitment to continuing the series “with the vision and spirit built by Harada-san,” promising to keep community feedback at the core of their approach as Tekken moves into its next era.</p>

            <p>Remember that trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4, which made the rounds last week? Well, I am sorry to say it was indeed unofficial after all, and Ys Net is now considering legal action against the uploader.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said last week's trailer - which clocked in at over four minutes - has "absolutely no connection" to the studio. Its logo was used "without permission", Ys Net said, "falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"We recognise that the unauthorised use of our logo, and any act that misleads viewers into believing such content is official, constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," Ys Net continued.</p>
<p>"We are currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action".</p>
<p>While Ys Net does not actually own the Shenmue IP, with that honour belonging to Sega, the studio apologised to its community for the confusion last week's trailer may have caused. Let's be honest, it surely raised more than just a few hopes (I mean, last year fans of the series went so far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">rent out a billboard in New York's Time Square to campaign for a fourth game</a>).</p>
<p>"We will continue to ensure the proper and accurate dissemination of information, and we ask for your understanding and cooperation," Ys Net's statement on the fake trailer closed.</p>
<p>As for the offending trailer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/real-or-ai-fake-suspicious-off-screen-shenmue-4-trailer-sparks-excited-debate">it followed Shenmue protagonist Ryo as he went about various around-the-town jobs</a>, such as washing dishes and arm wrestling. Many were sceptical about its legitimacy from the off, though, with the video coming from an unknown and unvalidated YouTube source with very few followers.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> resurrected the RPG series in 2019, and our former editor Martin Robison was rather taken with it all. "A bewitching time capsule that transports us to late 80s China, and to turn-of-the-century video games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer's Shenmue 3 review</a>.</p>

            <p>Long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken</a> director, producer, and general advocate for the virtual graps Katsuhiro Harada has announced he's leaving Bandai Nanco at the close of 2025. Harada's opted to step away as the fighting series turns 30, though he does have one more guest appearance at the Tekken World Tour finals lined up early next year. He's also released an hour-long DJ mix on Soundcloud to commemorate the occasion, making up for the fact he never got around to DJing live at a Tekken tournament.</p>

<p>"With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," the developer announced on Twitter.</p>
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect," he added "Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator'. During that period, I sought advice from [former Sony Computer Entertainment CEO] Ken Kutaragi — whom I respect as though he were another father — and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p> <div>

<p>Harada added that he's spent the past five years or so gradually handing over all of his responsibilities, as well as custodianship of Tekken's stories and world, to the rest of Bandai's Tekken team.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">put out a statement</a> on behalf of Tekken 8's developers, thanking Harada and assuring players "that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8." "We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide," that statement continues.</p><p>Heading back to Harada's goodbye post, the veteran developer wrote that he'll share more info about his next steps "at a later date". For now, he left things off by sharing an hour-long DJ mix he's created and popped on Soundcloud. "For 30 years I kept saying, 'I’ll do it someday,' and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event," the dev explained. "So instead, I will be releasing — for the first and last time — a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement. Listening to it brings back many memories."</p>
<p>You can give the DJ mix, dubbed 'TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix' <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix">here</a>. I can confirm the first five minutes are very funky.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c8fd6d87e84de"><a title="Harada leaves Bandai Namco" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8fd6d87e84de/harada-leaves-bandai-namco.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN">Katsuhiro Harada</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Katsuhiro Harada, the executive producer and director of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken</a> franchise — a man often referred to as a father of sorts to all things Tekken — has announced via social media that he'll be stepping down from his role at Bandai Namco, and therefore from involvement in the series, at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The legendary director (and voice of Law and Yoshimitsu, not to mention a few others, on some of the earlier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tekken_3d_prime_edition">Tekken</a> entries) says he's timing his departure to fit in with the 30th anniversary of this most beloved of fighting franchises.</p>

<p>Harada's post was also shared by <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">the official Tekken X account</a>, which added a few pertinent details, lest fans get a little concerned. The post states that the departure won't affect DLC plans or future updates/plans for Tekken 8 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tekken-8-on-switch-2-would-be-a-lot-of-work-but-director-isnt-ruling-it-out">when are we getting that on Switch 2, eh?</a>) and the franchise at large, whilst also wishing Harada well, and pointing out that he'll make an appearance at the Tekken World Tour 2025 finals in Sweden at the end of January.</p>
<p>In a lengthy and very personal message, Harada also described his roots and reasons for moving on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</p>
With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.
<p>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centers overseas.<br>
I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to “Please try TEKKEN,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.<br>
The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.<br>
And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.<br>
Those memories are also deeply precious to me.<br>
In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.<br>
Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”<br>
During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.<br>
His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p>
<p>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.<br>
Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.<br>
Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.<br>
To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.<br>
I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.<br>
Thank you very much for everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>【Postscript】<br>
Although I will be leaving the company at the end of 2025, Bandai Namco has asked me to appear at the TWT Finals at the end of January 2026, so I expect to attend as a guest.</p>
<p>For 30 years I kept saying, “I’ll do it someday,” and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event.<br>
So instead, I will be releasing—for the first and last time—a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement.<br>
Listening to it brings back many memories.<br>
Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, Tekken. For gamers of a certain vintage, it kinda still feels like one of the new challengers on the fighting block - as do most things that came after the cultural shock and awe of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_street_fighter_2_turbo">Street Fighter 2</a>. Harada's series brought us some of the most memorable characters outside of Capcom's huge stable of fighters, too, and the likes of Law, King and Yoshimitsu brought with them a 3D, limbs-based pugilism that feels as dazzlingly deep today as it did down the arcades in 1994.</p>
<p>Of course, and as everyone worth their salt knows, the best Tekken game on Nintendo consoles is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken Tag Tournament 2</a>, because...well, just look at it.</p>

<p>So long, Mr. Harada, all the best for the future and thanks for all the kickings!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-tide-review-worth-the-hasselhoff/</link>
            <guid>1375912</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’m too old to have experienced SpongeBob SquarePants in its original cartoon form, but it’s impossible to be a denizen of the internet without being exposed to the endless memes and references to the iconic series. Even without that, there have been a whole host of games starring the lovable sponge over a multitude of different consoles. The best of these by far have been the 3D platformers following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/05/thq-nordic-annouce-spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated/">Battle for Bikini Bottom</a>, with developers Purple Lamp continuing to produce high quality games that capture the madcap nature of the cartoon whilst also providing genuinely entertaining gameplay. SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of Tide&nbsp;sees an interesting new batch of mechanics and some real standout moments, but how does it match up to its predecessors?</p>
<p><iframe title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide | Titans of the Tide Karaoke" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/znxlF8Fjams?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The karaoke trailer for Titans of Tide needs to be watched to be believed, containing as it does the dream beach team of SpongeBob and the Mighty Hoff. Hasselhoff sings an adapted version of the earworm shanty, Wellerman, and even has a recurring cameo in the game as the voice of wisdom whose advice is unlocked by finding well hidden golden TVs. Such gods of the bay set the scene for the epic conflict that underpins the game, a conflict which sees King Neptune and The Flying Dutchman duking it out over an argument about who gets to cut the line at the Krusty Krab.</p>


<p>Aesthetically, Titans of Tide is very familiar, with the artstyle and many of the assets being brought forward from Purple Lamp’s previous games. This isn’t necessarily a negative, though, as they nailed the look of 3D Bikini Bottom in those earlier titles – you think they redraw everything from scratch for each episode of the cartoon? The soundtrack, similarly, is reminiscent of earlier games, but suits the action perfectly, and while the voice acting is authentic, it still suffers from the repetition of throwaway lines and can become annoying.</p>


<p>So, in many ways, Titans of Tide is more of the same in this series, following the mantra of ‘it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. Where changes are made, however, is the main gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>During the initial scuffle that gives the game its name, Spongebob is hit by a bolt from The Flying Dutchman which kills him outright. Game over, man, right? Well, fortunately for the story, he continues as a green ghost flying around the scenery. We swiftly switch perspectives to play as Patrick who rushes to the Krab to see what has happened. Upon finding his ghostly pal, the two best friends discover that the power of their ring of friendship allows them to switch forms, with one being corporeal and one a ghost.</p>

<p>This swapping mechanic becomes the key gameplay tool as you work through the five sizeable worlds in your quest to set things right. Spongebob can karate kick obstacles and red balloons to reach new areas, whilst Patrick can dig under the surface and pick things up. Later in the game, Spongebob also receives a bubble wand that can activate switches and distant items. This relatively limited moveset is stretched out to create puzzles that force you to use each skill and often switch between each character in rapid succession. At its best, these navigation areas can make you feel like spongey ninja, but often they are very simple. This is a kid’s game after all.</p>
<p>Spread across the worlds of Bikini Bottom you’ll come across tiki statues containing coins, life restoring underpants, switches and targets that require specific skills to activate, and reality shifting jars that alternate between green and blue – with parts of the level appearing and disappearing to match. Small environmental puzzles or platforming challenges are rewarded with chests containing either parts of HP increases, filters for the ingame camera mode or costumes for the dynamic duo. While most of these are quite easy to spot there are plenty of deviously hidden ones for completionists to find.</p>

<p>In truth, getting your money’s worth out of the game will require you to take a completionist approach as there is only 6 or 7 hours worth of content here outside of replaying levels to find everything. The game might not be a £70 retail game, but the inevitable launch day DLC and Season Pass still feel pretty stingy. Finding the collectables unlocks Plankton challenges that offer standalone levels that feel heavily influenced by Mario Galaxy’s void levels. These are the most enjoyable parts of the whole game, so it’s a shame that they are hidden behind the repetition of seeking out every chest.</p>
<p>While the 3D platforming is solid throughout, I could have done without the frequent sliding sections that return from earlier games. These are harmless enough in themselves but the races attached to each were quite buggy pre-release. Some races involve a spectral surfboard but restarting often resulted in no board spawning at all. Other sliding sections see both characters using their tongues as sleds which is just horrific. Combine this with the paid DLC that makes the two leads naked and you have genuine nightmare fuel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Katsuhiro Harada has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 55-year-old Japanese video game developer legend, who worked on all the Tekken games right up until last year’s Tekken 8, said in <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement posted to social media</a> that the loss of close friends in his personal life and the retirement or death of senior colleagues had caused him to reflect on the time he has left as a creator. Advice from Ken Kutaragi — the "father of PlayStation" — supported Harada in making the decision, he said. Harada failed to reveal what he plans to do next, but he did not say he was retiring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada has had a somewhat frought relationship with the Tekken series and indeed Bandai Namco in recent years, and has spoken openly about the development difficulties he's endured while at the company. Most recently, Tekken 8 has caused a great deal of friction between players and the development team, and Harada has stepped in multiple times on social media to address fan concern.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/harada-1765184996704.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tekken chief Katsuhiro Harada will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Photo by SIA KAMBOU/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most high-profile example of this came in October last year, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-chief-katsuhiro-harada-says-hes-going-to-rethink-his-role-following-dlc-stage-backlash">Harada addressed a row over the sale of a premium DLC stage for Tekken 8</a> after fans accused Bandai Namco of “corporate greed.” His explanation for the DLC stage basically came down to his role on Tekken within Bandai Namco, and his separation from the business side of the operation to focus on development. This structural set-up was a mistake, Harada admitted in a tweet he eventually deleted, and he confirmed plans to reorganize not only the Tekken business but his role within it to ensure community expectations were met in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's what Harada said, at the time:</p><blockquote>The Tekken project is divided into two companies: a game development studio and a publisher that is responsible for game sales (at the time of the development and release of Tekken 7, the development and publishing companies were not separate).</blockquote><blockquote>As some of you may know, I moved to the Development Studio side a few years ago, and have been focusing on maximizing the quality of the content/tech/graphics etc...</blockquote><blockquote>The development side and publishing side each have their own roles, and there are differences in the way they think and the responsibilities, I who should be the one to act as a bridge between the two, have not been able to properly participate in the publishing (sales) decision-making process for Tekken. As a result, I think that there were parts of the process that did not take the Tekken community's opinion into account.</blockquote><blockquote>I think I failed to create an organizational structure that would allow me to oversee things beyond my own position.</blockquote><blockquote>One of my roles was to listen to the opinions of the community and reflect them not only in the content but also in the out-game, but I was clearly becoming passive, worrying about the relationships between companies and not exercising my role.</blockquote><blockquote>From now on, I will review this structure and change it to one that values the community as it did in the past.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a typically frank statement from Harada, who was never shy to criticize his paymasters at Bandai Namco over their management of Tekken and the company’s various fighting game franchises. In June last year, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-chief-katsuhiro-harada-gets-remarkably-candid-discussing-why-soul-calibur-disappeared">Harada was remarkably candid in discussing why Soul Calibur disappeared</a>, and has spoken about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-actually-tried-to-get-colonel-sanders-as-a-guest-character-but-kfc-turned-him-down">trying and failing to get KFC mascot Colonel Sanders in Tekken</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Harada's exit statement in full:</p><blockquote>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</blockquote><blockquote>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</blockquote><blockquote>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centers overseas.</blockquote><blockquote>I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to “Please try TEKKEN,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.</blockquote><blockquote>The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</blockquote><blockquote>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.</blockquote><blockquote>And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.</blockquote><blockquote>Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.</blockquote><blockquote>Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”</blockquote><blockquote>During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</blockquote><blockquote>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</blockquote><blockquote>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.</blockquote><blockquote>Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.</blockquote><blockquote>Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you very much for everything.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada joined Namco (long before the acquisition that created the Bandai Namco we know today) in the early '90s to work on Tekken's arcade versions, which always launched first before console ports were released. He spent much of his time visiting Japanese arcades to check how Tekken was being played out in the wild, essentially living at the office.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Harada was a junior member of staff, but over the course of several years he worked his way up the chain to become the director of Tekken and the face of the franchise, attending community events while wearing his trademark sunglasses and making a fist — a reference to Tekken's tagline, 'The King of Iron Fist,' — for photo opps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">1998's Tekken 3, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest fighting games of all time, was the first Harada worked on as director and a smash hit, selling at least 8.36 million PlayStation copies worldwide. It became the PS1's fifth best-selling game ever ahead of the likes of Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, and Resident Evil 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada's exit comes at a crossroads for Tekken. Tekken 8 sold 3 million copies a year from release, according to Bandai Namco, which said the game was selling at a faster pace than Tekken 7. But we haven't had a sales update since January, and Bandai Namco has yet to announce new DLC characters for a potential Season 3. Will Bandai Namco release a Tekken 9 any time soon?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by SIA KAMBOU/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise.</p><p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," Harada wrote in an online post. "In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.<br>My roots lie…</p>  — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Harada added that he'd been gradually preparing the Tekken team for his departure, and he was grateful to have worked on the series and on several other games, such as Pokken Tournament and SoulCalibur. While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work.</p><p>Despite a strong launch and 3 million sales in its first year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-negativity-can-seem-bigger-than-it-is-dev-says/1100-6533921/" data-ref-id="1100-6533921">Tekken 8 has faced an uphill struggle throughout 2025</a>. Longtime fans have received recent gameplay updates, and character changes have been poorly received. Many players have also criticized the game's microtransaction system.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s Xbox published horror game OD sure does sound odd.</p>
<p>As part of a new interview, the Death Stranding creator not only said he can't tell us "exactly" what OD actually is yet, he also doesn't even know "if it will work out" in the end.</p>

<p>"We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games," the Kojima Productions head told <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735">ananweb</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/">Automaton</a>). As well as Death Stranding 1 and 2, the developer is also best known for the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>But for the horror-flavoured OD, he continued, the studio is "trying to change the service model from the ground up", with Kojima adding "it should be quite challenging".</p>
<p>That all being said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-and-xbox-team-up-to-show-off-more-od-knock">OD developer did say the recent trailer was "packed" full of hints</a>. "So if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out", he closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much more about it at the time. Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer are both tied to the project, and there is also some involvement from director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p><p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">Kojima recently admitted he was sure plenty of people will hate OD</a>, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>

<p>A Switch Lite, but comfy!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What do you do when you're surfing the old interwebs and happen upon a bunch of lovely gaming folk wondering if anyone has ever stuffed a Switch — in fully working order — into a Wii U GamePad (also still in complete working order)?</p>
<p>Well, if it were us, we'd shut off our internet and go for a nice, long walk outside. Maybe we'd never come back. However, (and as reported by <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/55674-modder-crams-a-switch-into-a-wii-u-gamepad">GoNintendo</a>) retro gaming YouTuber and modder extraordinaire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KouzexMods">@KouzexMods</a> accepted it as a challenge and decided it was time to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>As you can see in the impressively detailed video up top, this was no half-hearted job either. Nope, this expert retro modder has gone all in, drawing up a list of rules to stick by and everything, and it's fascinating to watch along as a Switch Lite console is stripped right down, very carefully, whilst designs are drawn up for how to have every part of the Wii U GamePad still fully functional whilst making it useable and comfortable.</p>


<p>There are even some improvements made to the base Switch console's performance during the process here, with upgrades to its battery, screen and a few other things that you can check out in the vid. Honestly, it's worth watching the full thing to see just how much effort and ingenuity went in here, and how problems met along the way were circumvented.</p>
<p>The vid wraps up with what we have to say looks like a very polished hybrid console, and muscle memory tells us that — let's face it — it's probably way more comfortable to hold than a vanilla Switch Lite. Man, that GamePad was comfortable.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Like the modding job that's been done here? Fancy turning your GamePad (if you're one of the seventy or so people who owned one) into a Switch? Let us know! (But also, don't blame us when you break it)</em></p>

			<p>Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-might-have-canceled-legacy-of-kain-game-new-layoffs-reported/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently made headlines after suffering new layoffs</a>, and information from those who left the game developer revealed that the team had been working on a canceled game set in the Legacy of Kain franchise, among others. </p>



<p>However, renowned leaker Tom Henderson stated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8RcRXnHX8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the latest episode of the Insider Gaming podcast</a> that these layoffs are not directly related to the cancellation of the Legacy of Kain game, which occurred around the same time <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Deus Ex project was canceled</a>.</p>



<p>The latest round of cuts, according to Henderson, is instead linked to other reasons. Chiefly, despite the many cancellations, Eidos Montréal still has a big game in development that's scheduled to launch next year, which is starting to ramp down as it heads toward the end of production, leading to layoffs.</p>



<p><em>They are working internally on quite a big project. I'm not going to mention the name of it, but basically, this big project is an open world action adventure third-person game which is being created by the same team that did <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and it's been in development since 2019. It's gone through quite a lot of changes. That game has been in development for six years, and internally it's called P11. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>The layoffs are related to that project in particular because they are starting to ramp down the headcount now. Conceptualization and all of the systems and all that kind of stuff has been complete and they're gearing up for beta and that game is scheduled to release next year. So that's whittling down the headcount of that particular project.</em></p>



<p>If that's the case, we might be getting an announcement at The Game Awards in just a few days. That's just speculation on our part, though.</p>



<p>Other recent cuts at Eidos Montréal were seemingly related to another canceled project, a card game 'with a story spin' based on The Lord of the Rings. To give fans an idea of the number of projects that were discarded internally, according to Henderson, the developer has reached Project 22 while they still have to finish Project 11.</p>



<p>Their last project to launch was Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy in October 2021. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a great game in its own right</a>, it did not sell particularly well. Hopefully, they can secure a win with this P11 title; it would be a shame if another game ended up like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolith Productions</a>.</p>

You were only hungry, and the modders controlling your great maw were keen to see how Melinoë would cope with taking on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> run through the underworld which Zagreus blazes through in the first game.</p>

<p>Fittingly, then, the mod (spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/theres-a-mod-that-lets-you-play-hades-1-in-hades-2/">Poseidon Chronos Gamer</a>) which adds that underworld run path to Hades 2 is called Zagreus Journey. With it installed, Melinoë'll be able to head through a chaos manhole out of the crossroads located between the two doors leading to her usual paths. Jumping into this new exit sees the princess of the underworld emerge in Tartarus, then fight through Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx, battling all the same enemies Zag once did. Naturally, though, this time you'll be slapping them up with Mel's abilities and Hades 2's selection of boons.</p>
<p>Zagreus doesn't feature in combat, but he does pop in to handle all of the dialogue, delivering lines from the first game while Melinoë stands silently by his side. Get all the way to the end, and you'll get to see how the talents Mel's honed battling the time bloke and those besieging Olympus stack up against her dear old dad, Hades.</p><p>The modder behind this splicing of two mythical smitings, Nikkel Mollenhauer, writes in its description that they do have plans to add in some new story beats and dialogue between Melinoë and other Hades 2 characters about the new route at some point down the line. That'll serve as a fresh epilogue of sorts, since the modder reccomends you wait until you've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-post-launch-patch-1-revamps-melinoes-true-ending-and-is-out-now-in-steam-preview-form">the game's true ending</a> before taking the underworld plunge. Fresh incantations that'll enable meta-progression on the new route, erebus gates, and extra boons are also on their future to-do list, as well as getting the original Hades' secret boss fight up and running.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving their work a go, you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes?tab=readme-ov-file">Github</a> or <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/">Thunderstore</a>. You'll need to zap all of your other current Hades 2 mods to get it working, as well as make sure you've got both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">Hades 2</a> and the original Hades installed in a place the mod can find them.</p>

                <p>As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">$55 billion deal</a> for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/" data-ref-id="1100-6536717">$82 billion agreement</a> for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors.</p><p>The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world.</p><p>Neither the Warner Bros. nor the EA deals are guaranteed to go forward, since both of them have to win regulatory approval after facing heavy scrutiny. Both, however, have major implications for the video game industry. If the EA deal is completed, Saudi Arabia's PIF will reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-control-of-ea-could-shift-to-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-report/1100-6536660/" data-ref-id="1100-6536660">gain majority control of the company</a>. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have raised their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-saudi-deal-draws-scrutiny-from-us-senators-over-foreign-influence/1100-6535453/" data-ref-id="1100-6535453">concerns about "foreign influence" on EA</a>. In a regulatory filling last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">EA claimed it would retain creative control</a> of the company.</p><p>As for Netflix and Warner Bros., the deal would leave the former in charge of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter</a> video game franchises. The streamer demonstrated greater ambition for the gaming industry until 2024, when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">shut down a AAA multiplayer shooter</a> from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. In October, Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squid-game-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-652368">Squid Game: Unleashed</a> mobile game--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-closes-its-squid-game-studio/1100-6535709/" data-ref-id="1100-6535709">closed by the streamer</a>.</p>

                <p>The Game Awards founder Geoff Keighley has been teasing an upcoming game announcement, which happens to involve a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/" data-ref-id="1100-6536594">massive, glowing, demonic statue</a> placed in the middle of the California desert.

"Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.

"I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop. That's our view on it. But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special."</p><p>EA has reportedly told its developers to treat AI as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>," while Sega has said that it will implement AI tools "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-says-it-will-leverage-ai-in-game-development-when-appropriate/1100-6536698/" data-ref-id="1100-6536698">when appropriate</a>."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tekken-franchise-lead-katsuhiro-harada-leave-bandai-namco-end-of-2025/</link>
            <guid>1375867</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Katsushiro Harada, a General Manager at Bandai Namco and the man everyone identifies the Tekken series with, is leaving the company at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Truth be told, we already had an inkling earlier this year, when Harada shared on his LinkedIn page that he was 'open to work' and interested in roles such as Executive Producer, Executive Game Director, Vice President, Business Development, Business Development Executive, and Marketing. </p>



<p>When Tekken fans panicked, he <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied on X</a> not to worry about it, that he just wanted to 'meet more people' and 'expand his horizons in the future'. Now, though, there's no uncertainty <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403720328897671168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his LinkedIn message</a>:</p>



<p><em>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. [...] I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything.</em></p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada has been involved with the Tekken franchise since the beginning of his nearly 32-year career at Bandai Namco. For the first two installments, he was credited as the voice actor for characters Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu; however, he was promoted to Game Director starting with Tekken 3 in 1997.  As he mentioned in the message, he also worked on other games, like SoulCalibur IV, Ace Combat Infinity, and Pokkén Tournament. More recently, he was also listed as a producer for games published by Bandai Namco, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/man-of-medan-rusted-seaworthy-ghost-ship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Arise</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, his final major project was Tekken 8, which received widespread critical acclaim (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earning a 9/10 on Wccftech</a>) and sold exceptionally well. The publisher would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-has-sold-2-million-units-in-one-month-says-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce</a> that the game sold two million units in its launch month and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-hits-3-million-sold-year-after-launch-milestone-faster-than-tekken-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached three million units</a> one year after its release, outselling its predecessor in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>As a final parting gift for fans, Harada released an hour-long TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), something he always wanted to do but never got the time for. It is available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Rope Battles monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Diamonds and much more.</p>



<p>Rope Battles is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that sounds rather simple as players are placed in an intense combat arena where they use ropes, traps, items and whatever they can find to battle others. While it sounds like a rather easy game, players need to strategically master various rope techniques, timing, and special abilities to outmanoeuvre opponents. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate rope fighter and battle against friends or other players to test your skills.</p>



<p>Progression in Rope Battles revolves around improving your fighter and collecting the game’s two main currencies: Coins and Diamonds. Like most Roblox games, they are the player’s main resources within the Rope Battles universe and allow them to improve their fighter by buying new ropes, items and more. And so, because earning coins (and diamonds) purely through playing can be slow, redeeming official codes is a major boost — codes give you free Coins, sometimes Diamonds, or even spins.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Crash Bots is a fairly straightforward process with no prerequisite steps. However, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming Crash Bots codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Rope Battles on Roblox.</li>



<li>Click the Code button in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Enter a code into the pop-up text box.</li>



<li>Press Claim and enjoy your rewards.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rope-battles-codes">How To Get More Rope Battles Codes</h2>



<p>Rope Battles codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media pages. That includes the Reworld Makers community on Roblox, which you’ll need to join to access some codes. However, keeping track of the various sources can be time-consuming, especially with no system in place to tell users when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Rope Battles codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

            <p>Speculation is still brewing around the demonic statue <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> has planted in the Mojave desert ahead of The Game Awards this week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> studio CI Games is the latest to chip in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">Keighley teased the statue at the start of the month</a> with the words "regal.inspiring.thickness", and its demonic lights and skeletal figures had fans guessing which game it was related to, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and God of War being top guesses.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-still-surrounds-keighleys-demon-statue-ahead-of-the-game-awards-as-diablo-4-and-god-of-war-teasers-ruled-out">these were ruled out a day later</a>, with further guesses including Sony's forthcoming shooter Saros, or even Doom. Other studios have even jumped on the bandwagon, with <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1995971888464687211">Devolver quipping</a>: "We made it out of the bones of most of our interns and the remaining interns put it in the desert".</p>

<p>Perhaps the best evidence we have for the statue is a new reply from The Game Awards account, which states: "The [blank] are silent. [Blank] bleeds. New [blank] stir." What could it mean? </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The █████ are silent. █████ bleeds. New █████ stir.</p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1996993470322692176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>CI Games founder and CEO Marek Tyminski has now stepped in, not because the statue is related to the studio's forthcoming Soulslike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, but because the studio hopes it's related to something from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> maker FromSoftware.</p><p>"Flattered so many think we're behind that statue," Tyminski wrote on social media. "Can confirm it's not us, we're just as hyped as you are. Devs are praying it's something From. Huge respect to them and we dream of reaching that level one day."</p>
<p>Tyminski added "big news" is on the way for both Lords of the Fallen and its sequel, adding: "We've listened. Soon it's time to reveal."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Flattered so many think we’re behind that statue 😅 Can confirm it’s not us, we’re just as hyped as you are.

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>So could it really be something from FromSoftware? The DLC for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign has already been released, and the statue doesn't look related to either the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition or Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods, both due next year.</p>
<p>More likely, Tyminski is simply hoping for some positive attention in aligning the studio's work with that of FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen released back in 2023 and received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">two star review from Eurogamer</a>. While the studio has put in work to improve its poor launch day performance, it remains an unoriginal imitator of FromSoftware's Dark Souls games.</p>

            <p>The team behind Amazon's Fallout TV show hopes to begin shooting the third series this coming summer, with the goal to release new seasons as fast as possible.</p>
<p>That's coming from the series' executive producer, Jonathan Nolan. "With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," Nolan said in an interview with IGN (video below), before quipping: "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans, and all."</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The executive producer said he believes the "scope" of the Fallout show remains "undiminished season to season", and the cast and crew were all able to "work quickly enough" to get the second series "back on the air in a reasonable amount of time".</p>
<p>And, it seems this zippy way of doing things is something Nolan and the team want to continue.</p>
<p>"I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend," Nolan said. "You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>
<p>You can check out the full chat with Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet below.</p>

<p>Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November last year</a>, and that December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins shared a close up of the show's prosthetic team applying the Ghoul's leathery, nuclear worn skin</a>.

<p>But even with this setback, the second season of Fallout is still airing a little over a year after filming first began. Its third season, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">was confirmed back in May of this year</a>.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout will be heading to Amazon Prime on 17th December.

            <p>Katsuhiro Harada, has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p>
<p>"I'd like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025," he wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I've devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas. I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p>
<p>"The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator. Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the centre of my identity. And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars. Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p>

<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi - whom I respect as though he were another father - and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>"Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects - VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p>
<p>"To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>"I'll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything."</p>
<p>If you've been following Harada's outspoken comments over the past few years, this may not come as much of a surprise: the Tekken boss has made a few suggestions that his future may not rest within the walls of the Japanese publisher. First up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">he had a 'looking for work' tag on his LinkedIn page</a>, leading people to speculate that he was looking for the door in his current place of work.</p><p>Then, earlier this year, Harada spoke to Eurogamer about what a future without him would look like at Bandai Namco. "[I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">he told Connor Makar at Evo 2025</a>. "[Producer Michael Murray and I are] public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Murray also mentioned that he may have 'only one Tekken game left in him', so it feels like there could be a potential shift in the franchise as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> continues to grow and people start to think about what Tekken 9 (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> 3) could look like.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since launch. Alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of emergency patches</a> that had to be issued by the developer to appease irritated fans, there was also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-reneges-on-its-controversial-dlc-rollout-but-is-it-too-little-too-late">a glut of controversy</a> surrounding the game and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-street-fighter-6-monetization-hurdle">its DLC methods</a>, which Harada - in typical fashion - was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-community-up-in-arms-over-plans-to-add-premium-currency-to-game-post-launch">very outspoken about</a>.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about the game losing its identity without the dynamic, public-facing duo, fret not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> was the first game in the series for years that didn't include much input from Yoshinori Ono, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-figurehead-yoshinori-ono-leaves-capcom-after-nearly-30-years">who also left Capcom after 30 years with the company</a>. Street Fighter 6 has been a massive success, however, proving that there is life in these storied fighting games - even without the notable figureheads leading the charge with the crowd-facing side of development.</p>

<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoff-predictions-are-set">Budapest Major Playoff Predictions Are Set</h2>



<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major will run from December 11 – 14 and will feature a single-elimination bracket featuring eight of the best Counter-Strike teams in the business. Leading up to the grand final, every match will be a typical best-of-three run, while the grand final itself is more meaty with a best-of-five requirement.</p>



<p>The confirmed matches to start the Budapest Major playoffs have been locked in:</p>



<p><strong>December 11</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality vs. The MongolZ</li>



<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>December 12</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>MOUZ vs. FaZe</li>



<li>FURIA vs. Natus Vincere</li>
</ul>



<p>In terms of predictions, both Team Spirit and FURIA found a spot in the playoffs from flawless runs through the tournament’s third stage. They’re the favorites to scoop the trophy and the half-million-dollar prize. </p>



<p>In terms of the next stage, it’s easy to see the teams that are <strong>most likely </strong>going to make it through. It’</p>



<p>It’s a solid bet to assume that the semifinals will consist of Vitality, Team Spirit, FaZe, and FURIA. Looking even further, it’s easy to see a Team Spirit vs. FaZe Clan final, but only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Season 3 of Prime Video’s Fallout may be filming as soon as Summer 2026, should one executive’s hopes come true. Its second season is only weeks away and, with a third season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-already-announced-before-season-2-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already in production</a>, fans seemingly won’t have to wait long to return to the wasteland.</p>



<p>In the world of great adaptations, none came more of a surprise than Prime Video’s Fallout. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the series goes its own route yet keeps the action, heart, and comedy of the games. Released in 2024, the series was a smash hit with fans and critics. In fact, it was nominated for several Emmys, including Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. A second season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly greenlit</a>, now set in the vibrant New Vegas. With its release on December 17th, fans already can’t wait to see more. Fortunately, it seems filming is happening sooner than expected.</p>

<iframe title="Fallout Season 2 Exec Producers on New Vegas Factions, Deathclaws &amp; Mr. House" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Xes4q43OcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In an interview for IGN, series creator Jonathan Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet chatted about Season 2. At the tail-end of the interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/7Xes4q43OcI?si=PdsmZGkkQfDQUtRM&amp;t=1073">at around 17:50</a>, a question about Season 3 and possible locales was asked. In response, Jonathan Nolan stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Well, I say with regards to production, we’re hoping to be shooting again next summer</strong>,” says Nolan in the interview. “<strong>We’ll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all</strong>. I’m excited that, though the scope of the show feels undiminished season on season, Geneva and Graham and our incredibly talented cast and crew were able to work quickly enough to get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time. I think what’s happened with television, in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season, is kind of an unfortunate trend. You don’t want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that <strong>we like to be back on the air as soon as we can</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite Nolan’s comment, it seems a Summer 2026 filming date is not yet set in stone, so nothing is confirmed just yet. A third season was greenlit back in March 2025 after filming wrapped on the second season and seemingly started production then. If it does film in Summer 2026, fans could see the third season release as soon as Spring 2027, if all goes well. It’s too soon to say where the story will go with it, but given how well the first season did, it seems it’ll be in good hands. Either way, the December 17th release for Prime Video’s Fallout can’t come soon enough.</p>

GoChess Wizard comes with 32 sculpted game pieces made of high density ABS and vinyl. Each magnetic piece matches the medieval-inspired designs from the films and has intricate details. The white and black pieces are packaged in triangle slabs with custom slots to ensure they arrive in pristine condition. The pieces can also be stored in two Harry Potter-branded drawstring pouches.</p><p>The premium magnetic game board is only 0.34 inches thick and has built-in smart features. Each square has light LED lighting rings to display valid moves, make suggestions, and signal where to move the CPU pieces when playing solo. The chess bot has 32 difficulty levels and can be used as a personal trainer via the free companion app. Additionally, you can play online with friends and via matchmaking by connecting the companion app to Lichess or Chess.com.</p><p>The GoChess Wizard also comes with a smartphone/tablet stand and a USB-C charging cable. The board runs for 5-10 hours on a full charge and takes two hours to recharge.</p><p>There are two versions of the GoChess Wizard. The Mini comes with a 13.1 x 13.1-inch board and 1.37-inch squares. The GoChess Wizard Lite is a full tournament-size board--19 x 19 inches and 1.88-inch squares--but otherwise these sets are the same.</p><p>As of December 7, only the GoChess Wizard Mini is in stock with a $300 (was $380) holiday launch deal from Particula and Amazon.

This Bluetooth-enabled 3 x 3 cube has LED lights and positional tracking that registers each rotation and turn in the app. The app has an academy that walks you through the process of solving the cube for the first time. From there, you compete against players around the world, play minigames and puzzles, and track your progress with your solves to see where you can improve.</p><p>The GoCube's app integration is superb and the cube itself is solid. This is a magnetic cube, though it doesn't turn anywhere close to as fast as high-end speed cubes. The pillowed design also makes it feel different from traditional cubes.</p><p>For beginners and anyone who wants as change of pace by playing minigames and solving puzzles, the GoCube Edge is fantastic. I learned how to solve a 3 x 3 cube using the GoCube Edge in 2024. Today, I can solve every square cube up to 13 x 13. I still return to the GoCube Edge to practice and play minigames, because the smart cube features are so good.</p><p>There's also a 2 x 2 version of the GoCube for $35 (was $60). You can bundle the two models together for $73 (was $133). The GoCube comes with a carrying pouch, charging stand, and USB charging cable.</p><ul><li><strong>GoCube Edge 3 x 3 Smart Cube -- $40 (<del>$73</del>)</strong><ul><li><a

A seven-step tutorial teaches newcomers how to solve a Rubik's Cube for the first time.</p><ul><li><strong>Rubik's Connected 3 x 3 Smart Cube -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Particula+Tech%27s+Smart+Chessboard%2C+Including+New+Harry+Potter+Wizard%27s+Chess&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A54&amp;fnarticle_id=6536743&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fredirect.viglink.com%3Fkey%3Dfbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fparticula-tech.com%2Fproducts%2Frubik-s-connected%26cuid%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fparticula-tech-holiday-sale-gochess-wizard-smart-chess-harry-potter-edition%2F1100-6536743%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Particula</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Connected-Beginner-Intelligent-Rechargeable/dp/B08JYVKJTG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Amazon</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Rubik's Connected 2-Pack -- $70 (<del>$120</del>)</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Particula+Tech%27s+Smart+Chessboard%2C+Including+New+Harry+Potter+Wizard%27s+Chess&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A54&amp;fnarticle_id=6536743&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fredirect.viglink.com%3Fkey%3Dfbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fparticula-tech.com%2Fproducts%2Frubiks-connected-bogo-deal%26cuid%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fparticula-tech-holiday-sale-gochess-wizard-smart-chess-harry-potter-edition%2F1100-6536743%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Particula</a></li></ul></li></ul></div>                      </div>   </div><div title="6536743 - Particula GoDice" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5205" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536743 - Particula GoDice" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">GoDice Smart Dice Sets</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">2-Pack - $30 (was $50) / 6-Pack - $60 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Particula's smart dice have Bluetooth connectivity and 3D sensors that register rolls in a free companion app for iPad and Android. tablets.
