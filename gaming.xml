			<p>Exo is just a simple courier at the start of TRON: Catalyst, running through the city and delivering packages as quickly and efficiently as possible. But then one of them explodes, and she wakes up in an interrogation cell being accused of not only terrorism, but something much more troubling for the very fabric of the Arq Grid’s digital reality.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQQEnuaNhdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tron Catalyst sees Mike Bithell and his studio returning to this world and continuing their offshoot narrative branch that was started in Tron: Identity. If you’ve played that game, a detective-style visual novel, there are characters and story beats that will be familiar to you, though it doesn’t feel necessary to quickly grasp what’s happening in the world.</p>


<p>The focus early on is on Exo’s plight. With her interrogator Conn unable to get the answer he wants out of her, he sends her down to the arena to fight for her survival… but here’s where the main hook of Tron: Catalyst comes into play. Exo is thoroughly unprepared to fight, but luckily has the ability to trigger a glitch that rewinds time back to the start of a loop. Right back to that interrogation with Conn.</p>
<p>Now she knows what’s coming, she can instead head off to train before fighting, learning the basics of hitting things with melee and thrown Disc attacks, dodging and countering. On the standard difficulty, you can initially just mash your way through enemies in this tutorial prologue, but there’s later enemies, more hulking figures with sweeping hammers and thrown explosives, that start to need more care and skill to overcome.</p>

<p>Looping around in this prison arena, the story guides you through breaking out of the prisoner zone, tweaking the loop in a Dark Souls-y way both by Exo having gained knowledge, and through unlocked permissions, doors and ladders persisting between loops.</p>

<p>But the game as a whole does not play out within a single loop that you need to manipulate. This prologue concludes as you break out of jail by crashing a Light Cycle through the wall and make it back out into the city, starting a new loop which you can, once again, use to your advantage. Obviously, the Grid’s forces are on high alert for you, checking Identity Discs for past misdeeds at various checkpoints, forcing you to fight your way through to meet a contact that won’t remember your interactions from previous loops. It’s only by getting this wiped or cleaned up that you’ll have full access to the city and start to piece together how tentatively balanced this world is.</p>
<p>There’s already been talk of the glitches occurring in the Outlands, while the Automata are establishing an embassy, bringing flowing, curved architecture and a more individualistic philosophy that will clash with the structure and order that the Arq Grid demands. You can sense that it could all go a bit wrong in a heartbeat –&nbsp;which is probably a really, really long time for these Programs –&nbsp;though how much freedom you have within this narrative wasn’t there to see within the opening two chapters of the game.</p>

<p>Tron: Catalyst plays out entirely from a fixed isometric view point. It really pops from the screen with the neon lights running throughout the world, around everyone’s bodies in blue, orange and more individualistic colours. There’s a gloss and sheen to the streets of the city, doused by digital rain, in a way that absolutely feels becoming of the revitalised Tron film franchise, and it’s accompanied by another soundtrack from Dan Le Sac, who composed for Tron: Identity.</p>
<p>One minor disappointment is that, for conversations that switch to full screen character portraits with voice acting, these are static (outside of some shifting lights) and often unchanging. Hopefully there’s more variety through the game as you meet more people.</p>

<p>Tron: Catalyst is shaping up rather nicely, expanding this classic sci-fi world once more, and with an intriguing glitched time loop at its core. We look forward to decoding it in just under two months, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/tron-catalyst-gets-a-june-release-date-and-a-new-trailer/">the full release of Tron: Catalyst set for 17th June</a>.</p>

The new set will feature a number of monsters from the <em>Pokémon Sun </em>and <em>Moon </em>games on the Nintendo 3DS, like Solgaleo, Lunala, and regional variants of Raichu and Marowak. As has been the case with previous expansions, <em>Celestial Guardians </em>will also debut alongside a variety of events and special missions designed to gift players digital accessories.</p><p>Beginning on April 29th, you’ll be able to participate in new solo battle event to earn promotional cards like Rayquaza ex.

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-the-rehersal">Patrick Recommends: <em>The Rehersal</em>*</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Well.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Should you recommend people watch something that you found, at times, morally reprehensible? I was as huge fan of comedian Nathan Fielder's Showtime show, <em>The Curse</em>, but somehow dodged <em>Nathan For You</em>. Fielder's absurdist, reality-bending company seems right up my alley, and yet, I'd somehow gone large unexposed. But in preparing for the second season of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, I ended up watching the first season of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, almost by accident. I'd intended to catch an episode or two to capture the tone, not shotgun the whole thing. But in short order, I was utterly captivated by Fielder's straight faced ridiculousness, mixed with the show's earnest tone. Plus, it was funny to watch someone blow millions of dollars now what often amounted to very silly bits. That's good TV.</p><p><strong>Mild spoilers for <em>The Rehearsal</em> to follow, but I'll avoid specifics. </strong></p><p>The show presents itself as a journey in helping people work through a problem by staging how it <em>might </em>happen before it <em>does</em> happen, aka the "rehearsal." That's a compelling pitch, and the first episode is straight up a masterclass in walking the show's weird tone. It's probably a masterpiece. But as it goes on, the spotlight shits from Fielder's subjects to Fielder himself, but part of Fielder's trick is you cannot tell if he's playing a character. He's an unreliable narrator. OK, fine. But when this combines with an ongoing, elongated storyline about preparing to become a parent ends up involving putting a number of young children in situations where they could—and do—become emotionally confused, I was out on the show. I nearly threw my remote at the TV at one point in disgust over an arc related to this topic.</p><p>Like I said, morally reprehensible. Lotta blame to go around, not just Fielder. And it's obvious true my role as a parent played a big, potentially irrational, part of my reaction. Nonetheless. I cannot say it wasn't captivating television, though, which leaves me in a mixed place as a recommendation. It got me to ask a lot of questions, I'm just not sure if they were the questions the show wanted me to ask.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-the-studio">Rob Recommends: <em>The Studio</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Rogen doesn't always work, but he works here.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm a sucker for insider-y Hollywood satires. <em>The Player </em>hit me like a lightning bolt when I first saw it as a kid, and I've loved the genre ever since, for all its self-indulgence and self-congratulation masked as critique. With that background, I knew I'd at least check out Seth Rogen's AppleTV series. I did <em>not </em>expect it to have some of the best filmmaking I've seen all year.</p><p>The pitch on <em>The Studio </em>is pretty conventional: Seth Rogen is a Hollywood exec named Matt whose boss and mentor is fired as the head of the studio and he takes her place with dreams of making the kinds of great, commercial art he grew up on. The chalice is poisoned, however, because to get the job he has to sign on to produce the kind of vapid, brand-driven garbage that he thinks has ruined the movie business. Our hero is proven to be no hero at all, a bit too gutless to stand up for his beliefs when it matters, and a bit too clueless to actually navigate the job he's been elevated to. There is a lot of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm </em>in <em>The Studio</em>, though mercifully it's less excruciating if you find the awkward secondhand embarrassment of that series tough to endure. <em>The Studio </em>keeps things moving, within and between episodes.</p><p>One way it does that is by using long takes. I am not sure it ever shoots a scene as anything other than a single continuous shot, a "oner" in film parlance and the name of <em>The Studio's </em>instantly classic second episode. Matt's love of the movie business and fanboyish awe at oners leads him to crash the set of a movie where Sarah Polley is shooting a critical single-shot scene at magic hour in the hills above LA. Across twenty-five minutes with no evident cuts (the episode even has Polley spit at the idea of using <em>1917</em>-style whip-pans to disguise cuts instead of doing a true oner), Matt wreaks well-meaning havoc on the production. </p><p>The shooting style makes ever scene jangle with nervous, frantic energy, but also calls attention to the absolutely gorgeous locations and lighting that <em>The Studio </em>uses throughout. With a warm, sepia-tint to the colors emphasized by costumes and the mid-century furniture and architecture that the series showcases, it feels like a movie about the present day glimpsed through the lens of the 1970s. It's funny and awkward and stupid but it's beautiful, too.</p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-netrunner">Chia Recommends: <em>Netrunner</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Null Signal Games.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know, I know. “But Chia,” you say, “you’re always recommending <em>Netrunner</em>! What makes this week any different?” Well, it turns out I have a very good reason to make <em>Netrunner</em> my recommendation this week: Null Signal Games are releasing new cards! <a href="https://nullsignal.games/blog/welcome-to-elevation/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Elevation</em></a> is the newest set and will make up the second half of the “core sets” for <em>Netrunner</em>, and at the same time all of the old Fantasy Flight Games cards are rotating out of Standard play.</p><p>This marks a huge change in the card pool for Standard, since 2018 this is the first time that <a href="https://nullsignal.games/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-elevation/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">all the sets in Standard are actively purchasable from NSG</a>. I’m biased as a person who started playing well after the last FFG cards were printed, but it really feels like Null Signal Games has done a phenomenal job of making interesting new cards while avoiding a bit of the power creep that plagued some of the later sets during the FFG run.&nbsp; And from what we’ve seen of <em>Elevation</em> so far, they’re showing no signs of slowing down.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Null Signal Games.</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the uninitiated: <em>Netrunner</em> is an asymmetric 1v1 card game that has one player taking the role of the Corp, building servers and trying your best to advance your nefarious agendas, and the Runner, who is hacking into those servers and trying their best to find and expose those agendas. The corporation plays all of their cards face down so hidden information plays a huge role in the game. The game has an action based structure, each player has an allotted amount of clicks (4 for the runner, 3 for the corp) that you use to do basic actions (like draw, gain money, or play cards). This system means that you’ve got more ways to mitigate the inherent randomness of card games and feels like Richard Garfield’s response to mana-flood (yes, the original 1996 release was made by the same guy that made Magic!)</p><p>The new set showcases so many reasons I have loved this game, and even more importantly, why I love the broader netrunner community. Not only is the game mechanically spectacular, but NSG really goes the extra mile when considering inclusivity and representation. There are many queer members of NSG and their input shows in so many ways. <em>Elevation</em> is set in a futuristic version of Borneo, in Kalimantan, and includes many new Identities, the cards that you essentially play as and build your deck around, and in them you see a breadth of people. <a href="https://nullsignal.games/blog/introducing-the-new-card-frames-in-elevation/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">These identity cards include pronouns for the different runners</a>, and on the back you get a story blurb for each.</p><figure></figure><p>This seems like a small, perhaps forgettable inclusion, but I think the fact that it’s 2025 and <em>Netrunner</em> is one of the only card games out there with queer people front and center that also forefronts that queerness on the card itself and not just in side stories feels like a damn shame. And the fact that the response from the community to this inclusion was resoundingly positive in a world where those identities are being put more and more under threat every day makes me feel welcome in a way that I can’t say of other gaming communities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t checked it out, I wholeheartedly suggest you take a peek at <em>Netrunner</em>. Start with <em>System Gateway,</em> and then the newest set <em>Elevation</em>. Join this growing community of people playing one of the best god damn card games I’ve ever played!</p>

                <p>In 2023, IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser started a new studio, Wombo Games, alongside veteran developers who previously worked on Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex, and Just Cause. Now, Wombo Games is sharing an early look at the company's first game, Raiders of Blackveil, a roguelite action-RPG.</p><p>Raiders of Blackveil has single-player and co-op options for up to three players. The main characters in the game are humanoid animals who live on "a dystopian industrial fantasy world" where the human-controlled Blackveil corporation has forced them into servitude. That's why the animals are launching an armed rebellion against Blackveil to reclaim their freedom and their world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481923" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481923"></a><figcaption>An early screenshot from Raiders of Blackveil.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481924,1300-4481925,1300-4481926,1300-4481927" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg"></figure><p>According to Wombo Games, Raiders of Blackveil will be a deeply strategic game that blends "MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot, and PVE extraction gameplay." The game is currently available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world," said Flösser in a statement. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year."</p><p>Early access for Raiders of Blackveil is expected to launch this summer.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-tron-identity/" data-ref-id="5000-571854">Tron: Identity</a> brought a unique look inside the world of Disney's tech-heavy universe, as developer Bithell Games told a story of sabotage and subterfuge in a consequence-driven visual novel. The events of the story focused heavily on what the player chose to do, and how they reacted to the consequences of those choices. It was a novel--pardon the pun--approach to Tron, and one that, while not perfect, was effective in expanding the lore of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">This year, Bithell Games will bring us back into its version of the Tron universe in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-tron-catalyst/" data-ref-id="5000-647165">Tron: Catalyst</a>, a follow-up to Identity's story with a new set of characters and an entirely new approach. The visual novel format is gone, replaced with an isometric action-oriented format that gives the player more direct engagement with the world. The shift is a gamble, but based on my experience with the first 90 minutes of the game, it's one that has enough promise that it might pay off in the end.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney TRON Catalyst Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">A new identity</h2><p dir="ltr">Those who played Tron: Identity may have a set of expectations with Catalyst, but as mentioned above, those expectations need to be derezzed. Catalyst is a vastly different experience, one that encourages exploration and direct combat over heavy dialogue and puzzle-solving. Where Identity felt more like an Ace Attorney style of game, Catalyst gives the same vibes as Supergiant's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a> or, perhaps more accurately given the similar setting, Neon Giant's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-ascent/" data-ref-id="5000-511894">The Ascent</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Catalyst's heroine, Exo, must explore parts of the city either on foot or riding the series' iconic Light Cycle--the latter of which she can summon at will. Her travels will match her against members of The Core, the neon-orange-tinged aggressors trying to maintain control of the Arq Grid. Fighting them, on the surface, seems simplistic: Exo can swing her disc for a three-hit combo by tapping the attack button, she can charge up a powerful melee attack by holding the attack button down, and she can defend herself through dodges and timed parry abilities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481609" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481609"></a><figcaption>Why walk when you can Light Cycle?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">By aiming with the right stick and pressing the throw button, Exo will throw her disc in an enemy's direction, where it will damage them before returning to her. She can ricochet the disc off of walls to try and hit an enemy from behind--which deals more damage--and eventually, she can immediately kick the disc back at a group of enemies when it returns to her for a quick disc throw combo.</p><p dir="ltr">Mastering the disc throw mechanic is going to be the key to success in Catalyst's combat, but it's worth it; landing a hit after choosing the right angle with a disc throw is incredibly satisfying, especially if the enemy is at low health and the hit takes them out. Normal melee attacks are fine, if uninteresting, but coupling them with disc throws makes fighting the Core enemies much more unique.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Thrown through a loop</h2><p dir="ltr">The new focus on action does not mean dialogue has been completely removed, however. Catalyst will still feature back-and-forth dialogue with key characters throughout the game, and choices will still need to be made. However, this time, the branching dialogue is an element in Tron: Catalyst's most intriguing element: Restart.</p><p dir="ltr">If Exo hits a dead end, Catalyst gives her the ability to "restart" the mission she's currently in, while retaining all of the information she's received thus far. While this does technically negate any progress made, it does allow you to approach the mission with a fresh perspective. Maybe the first time through a level, you turned left down a hallway, so this time you know that you should go right. Or, the first time you spoke to a character, you chose one dialogue option and didn't like the outcome, and now you can choose the other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481610" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481610"></a><figcaption>Catalyst adopts an isometric view.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both chapters that were available in the preview build made heavy use of the Restart mechanic, showing off its full potential rather quickly. In one mission, I alerted the Core to my presence in the first conversation I had, so I had to continuously fight them off as I made progress in the story. However, just before I hit a dead end, a character gave me the ability to shield important data on Exo's disc from scans, meaning that when I restarted the loop and approached the NPC again, I was able to move freely and no one was alerted.</p><p dir="ltr">This looping mechanic is very neat, as it allows you to fully explore a level with fresh eyes as it seamlessly transitions back to the beginning of the area. What's more, if your main mission requires you to restart the loop, the game does not hesitate to tell you--this is important, as it removes the possibility of you aimlessly wandering around the city wondering what to do before realizing you have to restart. It's easy to get lost in this neon-soaked urban paradise, so the friendly reminder is appreciated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481611" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481611"></a><figcaption>Aspects of Identity's visual novel format are maintained in this sequel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Tron: Catalyst preview build only lasted about 90 minutes, but that's all the time it needed to make a powerful first impression. Some may have been dismayed by Bithell Games's choice to move away from the interactive novel approach of Tron: Identity in favor of an action-based format, but in the short time I spent with Catalyst, that shift seems to be paying off greatly. The looping mechanic is unique and interesting, and combat does just enough to be fun thanks to the strategic element of disc throwing. The dialogue elements aren't as robust, but they serve as an imaginative way to inform future loops in a given level.</p><p dir="ltr">Bithell Games' previous Tron game seems like the studio finding its Identity in this universe; this new entry is shaping up to be the Catalyst for a new flagship franchise for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Tron: Catalyst is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, and PC on June 17.</p>

			<p>The co-founder of <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive</a> and former chief creative officer at Square Enix,&nbsp; <strong><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Janos Flösser, </span></strong>has started a new studio based in Copenhagen called <a href="https://www.wombogames.com/">Wombo Games</a>. Alongside the new studio announcement, Flösser has also announced the studio's debut project, a new roguge-lite called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">Raiders of Blackveil</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is currently set to arrive on Steam in Early Access sometime this summer, and is described as an "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">action-packed</span></em> <em>rogue-lite</em>" that looks to "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">blend MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot and PVE extraction gameplay to create a deeply strategic game filled with challenging, fun encounters that can be experienced alone or with friends</span></em>," according to a press release.</p>
<p>The setting is a dystopian fantasy world where you'll fight against an evil corporation run by humans named Blackveil. The human part is important because you're part of an animal rebellion against Blackveil, and either on your own or alongside two other animal friends in groups of three, you'll raid and plunder Blackveil in the fight to end the corporation's evil dominance.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Flösser describes Wombo Games as a mixture of industry veterans who have worked on games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex, paired with young, talented developers looking to make their mark on the video game industry.</p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,</em></span>" said Flösser. "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year...</em>"</span></p>

<figure></figure>


<p>With summer just around the corner, hopefully we'll hear more about Raiders of Blackveil soon.</p>

<p>Both legendaries will be getting ex cards, of course, along with the likes of Alolan Raichu. The trailer also gives us a glimpse of a rather beautiful full art Alolan Marowak card, as well as a number of new basic cards, item cards, and more.</p>

<p><em>Celestial Guardians&nbsp;</em>is arriving as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>prepares to celebrate its six-month anniversary (which is, according to DeNA and The Pokemon Company, a thing).</p>

<p>As part of that celebration, a new series of battles and missions will be available at the same time as&nbsp;<em>Celestial Guardians</em>. Taking them on will give you the chance to earn promo cards, including a gorgeous Rayquaza ex card, as well as other goodies.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, the clue's in the name; it's a mobile version of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game, in which you can collect cards, battle opponents, and trade with your friends (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">to a certain degree, anyway</a>).</p>

<p>Despite criticisms of some of its systems and monetization elements,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has proven <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful</a> for its developers, so you can expect to see new expansions appearing well into the future.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Sinners” is one of the earliest blockbusters of 2025, and for good reason. The fifth collaboration between director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B Jordan is also their most ambitious yet, as the ladder plays a pair of twin brothers who battle supernatural forces while opening up a new juke joint in Jim Crow era Mississippi. Below, see five spoiler-free reasons why you should see the movie (and don’t leave until the screen is completely Black).</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196566" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Please, Game Developers, Stop It With The Killmonger Swoop Already" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="196" data-playlist="196566,197541,197533" data-current="196566"><div><p>Please, Game Developers, Stop It With The Killmonger Swoop Already</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196566/196566_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196566/196566_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196566/196566_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196566/196566_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22120.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>It’s Three Movies In One</strong></p><p>“Sinners” is essentially three genres in one, and if you leave early, you’ll miss the brilliant way that director Ryan Coogler brings everything together. The first half of the film is essentially a Jim Crow era western, a period piece that finds twin brothers Smoke and Stack bustling around the Mississippi Delta to plan the grand opening for their juke joint. But in the time that follows, the movie blooms into even more: it’s a supernatural horror film, with characters wielding wooden stakes and garlic to fight bloodthirsty vampires, and a musical, with the blues working as both a narrative motif and as the film’s sonic heartbeat. </p><p><strong>That incredible ode to Black music</strong></p><p>In the trailer for “Sinners,” a voiceover of one its characters describes a legend of musicians’ whose gifts are so powerful that they can “conjure spirits from the past and future.” In this film, those capabilities are bestowed to Sammie, the son of a preacher who leads a small church in Mississippi. He has a stirring voice, no doubt – and there’s one moment where viewers get to see his celestial talents at work. It’s one of the biggest surprises in a film that’s full of them: a wonderful showcase of Sammie’s voice, an impressive display of expert editing and cinematography, and a beautiful ode to to the intergenerational power of music. </p><p><strong>The ambitious usage of IMAX cameras</strong></p><p>Ahead of the theatrical release of “Sinners,” a video was released online that gave Ryan Coogler a chance to break down the different types of film that were used in the creation of the movie. The video is admittedly a little inside baseball, but long story short, “Sinners” is the first movie that’s shot in two different camera systems – a creative approach that particularly shines in IMAX theaters. The screen expands vertically for the film’s most scenic moments, while it narrows into a wide screen for its most intense, intimate scenes. The result is a film that feels technically adventurous, and seeing the aspect ratios change in real time offers a sense of anticipation for what’s next.</p><p><strong>Give the movie the consideration it deserves</strong></p><p>“Sinners” is lots of fun its share of laughs, lust, and action to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. But it’s also sure to send viewers home with things to think about. The film and its characters have a lot to say about Black creativity, spirituality, allyship, freedom, and individuality. Its themes have had viewers’ group chats and social media feeds buzzing nonstop since opening night, and that’ll remain the case for a while. </p><p><strong>Post-credit scenes</strong></p><p>This isn’t a superhero movie, but Coogler still has a couple of tricks up his sleeve to reveal as the credits roll. So if you haven’t seen it yet, sit tight; and if you haven’t, it might be time to head back to the theatre for a second viewing. There’s a satisfying mid-credits scene that takes place 60 years after the events of the film, reuniting some of its characters for an epilogue that brings satisfying closure to its story. There’s also a post-credits scene at the very end that showcases Sammie playing a song on his beloved guitar, a moment that has deeper meaning after all that transpired in the film beforehand. </p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Tuesday, April 22.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And with many speculating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> is coming (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">it was leaked back in 2023</a>), how might Bethesda improve upon its 2008 post-apocalyptic role-playing game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bruce Nesmith, one of Fallout 3’s designers, has pointed to the game’s “not good” gun combat, which he expects Bethesda would improve significantly for a remaster.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, Nesmith said Fallout 3 Remastered would have shooting more in-line with that of Fallout 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What did you see in Fallout 4? That will tell you what they felt was necessary to change from Fallout 3,” Nesmith said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know in Fallout 4 there was a lot of work done on the gun combat, because Fallout 3 is the first time they ever tried to do a shooter-style game. And, well, I think the work that was done was amazing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they’re doing the same thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oblivion wasn’t just brought up to the 2011 version of Skyrim,” he added. “It was brought up to something that, at least on the surface, looks like it exceeds the most recent graphics update in Skyrim.” Nesmith has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-designer-says-bethesdas-remaster-is-so-impressive-it-could-be-called-oblivion-20">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is so impressive it could be called “Oblivion 2.0.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Bethesda, which is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> and, maybe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">more Starfield</a>.

		<p>RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business will lay down the law when this standalone expansion launches for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on 17th July,</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ykC7btuV6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>OCP’s plan to create a centralised control centre for all their law delivering robots has been thrown into disarray when&nbsp;Omni Tower has been overrun by mercenaries. RoboCop will have to fight his way up the tower, taking on a menagerie of classic goons, fan-favourite bots and flying drones and mercenaries along the way.</p>
<p>Thankfully there’s some new weapons and more brutal finishers to help mix things up as you make your way up the tower, as well as some new allies to work alongside. Inevitably, RoboCop will take one heck of a beating as he goes up floor-by-floor.</p>
<p>But there’s also special missions that will take players into flashback sequences to a time before RoboCop, giving the chance to play as Alex Murphy for the first time and reveal some about the game’s antagonist. It will be interesting to see how different that is compared to the rather stompy FPS action of the main game.</p>

<p>RoboCop: Rogue City is Teyon’s latest FPS based on an 80’s film franchise. Set between the second and third films, RoboCop methodically stomps around town on the trail of a new drug gang and peel back a new mystery while blasting everything in sight into smithereens. The game has passed a significant milestone with Nacon proudly touting over 1 million players since launch.</p>
<p>It’s also a game that’s divided opinion a little amongst our writers. A few of us have had a great time with it, getting exactly what they want out of a RoboCop game – one-note bipedal cop-bot action – while others were a little less enthused.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/31/robocop-rogue-city-review/">Ade handled our RoboCop review</a>, and sadly did not have the best of times, awarding it a 4/10 for some technical flaws, as well as a monotonous plodding pace to story and combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GeForce NOW users who love roleplaying games have plenty to do this week with the launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-on-april-24th-on-pc-and-consoles-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The games may differ heavily when it comes to RPG design (the former is a classic Western open world action RPG with real-time combat, whereas Clair Obscur is a linear JRPG-inspired turn-based game with some innovative real-time elements). Still, they have a few things in common: they're both powered by Unreal Engine 5, available on Game Pass, and can now be played on NVIDIA's cloud platform if you don't have the required PC hardware.</p>
<p>Both games&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution upscaling</a>, which can be enabled by any GeForce NOW user with a Priority or Ultimate subscription. Oblivion Remastered takes it one step further with DLSS Frame Generation and hardware-accelerated Lumen ray-traced global illumination, both of which can be activated by GFN players with an Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>We've covered Oblivion Remastered a lot in the past few days, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is also exciting. Critics have raved about it in their reviews, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging over 90 in the Metacritic scores</a> across all platforms. You'll have to wait a bit longer to read our review, as Wccftech was not provided with an advance code and has only been able to access the game today with everyone else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's the full list of weekly GeForce NOW additions:</p>
<p><em>● The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game</em><br>
<em>Pass, April 22)</em><br>
<em>● Sunderfolk (New release on Steam, April 23)</em><br>
<em>● Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, April</em><br>
<em>24)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Demo (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>
<em>● Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Demo (Steam)</em><br>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-dev-supermassive-reportedly-cancels-blade-runner-game.1172490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-blade-runner-game-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Quarry&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games has reportedly canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>game that was set to release some time in 2027.</p>

<p>That's according to an Insider Gaming report, which cites anonymous sources that supposedly worked on the project. According to Insider's report,&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live&nbsp;</em>was a "character-focused, cinematic action-adventure" game that would have run around 10-12 hours.</p>

<p>The game would have featured the four key pillars of "stealth, combat, exploration, and investigation", which would have set it apart from Supermassive's usual fare; the developer is mostly known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry" rel="nofollow">movie-style adventure games</a> that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-little-hope" rel="nofollow">don't usually feature much</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-man-of-medan" rel="nofollow">way of gameplay</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-supermassive-games-canceled-project-rumor.jpg?itok=yly1jTn2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-supermassive-games-canceled-project-rumor.jpg?itok=Bwf_bVCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Quarry&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games has reportedly canceled a&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Insider Games, you'd have access to various skills and abilities that you could upgrade in&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live</em>, and you'd also be able to use "past memories to figure out the story", as well as using "in-game technology to complete your investigations".</p>

<p>It sounds like the game would have been a pretty ambitious one, and it sounds pretty far out of Supermassive's usual wheelhouse as well; it puts me in mind of The Chinese Room's work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>Supposedly,&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live&nbsp;</em>would have arrived in 2027 across PC and current-gen machines, as well as the next generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assuming there is one</a> where Xbox is concerned, of course).</p>

<p>Insider's report says that the project would have cost around $45 million before music, testing, and other expenses, and that&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>rights holder Alcon Entertainment is the reason the game was canceled, although the report doesn't go into specifics "to protect the sources of the information".</p>

<p>Supermassive is also the developer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3</em></a>, which will be the first game in the series not to be developed by original studio Tarsier.</p>

            <p>Supermassive Games - known for releases such as Until Dawn and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a> - has reportedly cancelled an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game.</p>
<p>The project was titled Blade Runner: Time To Live, and according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUISqX5T6E">Insider Gaming</a>, it was going to be a "character focused, cinematic, action adventure" release, poised to be launched across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as on next generation Xbox and PlayStation systems. Reportedly, it was a single-player game, slated for a 2027 debut.</p>

<p>The report claims the player would be the only Blade Runner in 2065, and the game's campaign would feature a 10-12 hour "compelling" story, which would blend "the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay".</p>
<p>This story would see players taking on the role of So-Lange, the report states. So-Lange is a vintage model Nexus-6 "inexplicably still alive well beyond your limited lifespan".</p>
<p>Documentation seen by Insider Gaming reads: "Journey from the teeming undercity of New Zurich 2065 to the eerie remnants of the forgotten world beyond... Under orders to retire Rev, the mysterious and ruthless leader of an underground replicant network, you are betrayed and left for dead in a brutally hostile environment."</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time to Live was said to have entered pre-production in September 2024, with pre-production then expected to wrap up in March 2025. The end of prototyping, meanwhile, was set for this September.</p>
<p>On the cost side of things, Blade Runner: Time to Live's development budget was reported to be in the region of $45m, with $9m of this expected to cover external performance capture and acting talent.</p>
<p>The game was ultimately cancelled, reportedly towards the end of last year. As to why, that's allegedly due to Alcon Entertainment, who is the owner of the Blade Runner rights, although no further details were provided at this time.</p>
<p>While we may never know what could have been, according to one source, Blade Runner: Time to Live was "rather impressive".</p>
<p>Next up from Supermassive Games will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">long-awaited next Dark Pictures Anthology game, Directive 8020</a>. This one's set in space, features Bond and Marvel star Lashana Lynch, and has been in development for some time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The NvRTX branch of the impressive Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo sports some advanced features that even the most powerful GPU on the market cannot handle at native 4K resolution properly.</p>
<p>As shown in a new test video shared by Compusemble, advanced features like Mega Geometry, ReSTiR Global Illumination and Path Tracing and more can tank performance at native 4K resolution even on an<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/"> RTX 5090 GPU,</a> the most powerful GPU currently available on the market. In some scenarios, the demo runs at a whopping 13 FPS, proving how gaming hardware still isn't ready for some of the advanced RTX features NVIDIA has been working on. Things get slightly better with NVIDIA DLSS, and it's only in Performance mode that the RTX 5090 can run the demo at above 30 FPS in the same scenario that tanked performance at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah Demo: NvRTX Branch vs Stock UE5 - NvRTX Can Run As Low As 13FPS on 5090 Depending on the Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdbjsO8k8mM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even though the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah demo cannot be run at acceptable performance at native 4K resolution, there's no denying that some of the technology is impressive. Among the new features that have yet to be implemented in games is RTX Neural Rendering, which can quickly create a neural representation of thousands of textures to save VRAM and RAM much more than the currently used compression tech. More information on Neural Rendering can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>in Unreal Engine 5 (and, despite what the title suggests, nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>The Order: 1886</em>).</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3645160/view/545607485799530656" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, 11 bit says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is to "recreate the experience of the original game in [Unreal Engine 5]", and that the project is part of an effort to "further expand upon&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" away from the original game's now-defunct Liquid Engine.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game to which 11 bit referred in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow">most recent financial summary</a>; the studio already confirmed a 2027 release for that project, so unless there's another one in the works for the same year, it's most probably&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=R2Vt-VH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=jiUQUZya 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>aims to reimagine the original (pictured here) with new visuals and gameplay mechanics.</figcaption></figure><p>According to 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will feature "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer", serving as a "great introduction to the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" but also the perfect game for "die-hard fans".</p>

<p>However, the project won't just be a rebuilt version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Instead, it'll feature "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings", as well as a totally new path, Purpose, to go alongside Faith and Order.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will support expansion via DLC in future, as well as official modding support, which is something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">available for the second</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>but not for the first due to engine limitations.</p>

<p>You can check out the very brief teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give very much away, and it's really more of a mood piece than a full trailer, but hey, it might help you to get excited for the game.</p>




<p><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in 2027. No console release has been announced yet.</p>
