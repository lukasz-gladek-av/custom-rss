			<p>Gaming is at it’s best when it’s a little janky. As much as I appreciate the advances in tech that a lot of triple-A games have broken ground on, there’s an undeniable charm to a game that’s just a little busted yet full of heart. Double-A JRPGs made on a shoestring budget are some of the strongest soldiers of janky gaming, and for all their flaws they’re still absolute gems to experience. Reynatis will be a love it or hate it game for many, as it falls confidently into that category.</p>
<p>Despite wearing it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/29/kingdom-hearts-3-review-dlc-2020/">Kingdom Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/26/neo-the-world-ends-with-you-review/">The World Ends With You</a> inspirations proudly on it’s sleeve, this FuRyu developed modern mage adventure never reaches the same heights as those Tetsuya Nomura classics – but watching it shoot for the stars and seeing where it comes so close is still a hell of a time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reynatis - Demo Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXdiRXjgkWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Reynatis, magic and wizards are real – but only a select few are born with those abilities, and in the modern heavily-sanctioned Tokyo streets you can only use those gifts legally if you’re a member of the police force. Sari Nishijima is a high-ranking member of that magic-enabled police task force. and one of our protagonists. She spends long nights on the streets of Shibuya hunting down rogue wizards and potential magic users who are addicted to the street drug rubrum. Our other main character is Marin Kirizumi, an angsty magic-user who sets out to Shibuya with the incredibly vague and anime-as-hell goal of becoming the strongest magic user ever.</p>
<p>Reynatis tells a really dense story, but I wouldn’t say the overarching beats or twists are all that great. The opening chapters of the game are especially stiff – you’re introduced to two additional party members for each protagonist, and while the police co-workers who join Nishijima are well introduced, the quirky mage girls that end up tagging along with Kirizumi really don’t have any meaningful or well-done reason for doing so.</p>


<p>Despite the flawed story structure, I loved the smaller character moments throughout the game. In an angsty city and a story full of sacrifice and suffering, our characters find a lot of time to exchange silly banter with each other and bond really naturally. You even get to see text message exchanges between them all on your phone, although those texts are annoyingly organised in a giant list of individual conversations and not like actual per-contact text chains.</p>
<p>Combat in Reynatis almost has the opposite problem – at first, the small moments suffer, and each battle encounter felt like a bit of a chore. The game has a unique system where each of your three party members can change between two modes at any time – Suppressed state and Liberated state.</p>

<p>You’ll need to be in Liberated state in order to attack your enemies with basic attacks or special attacks, but being in those mode slowly drains your MP (and special attacks drain it even faster). When you’re in Suppressed state, you can’t attack at all but time will stop as enemy projectiles are about to hit you,&nbsp;letting you dodge them as much as you want. When a melee attack connects, you’re shown a circle rune on the screen. Hold the dodge button down enough to fill that circle, and you’ll dodge the attack plus recover a massive amount of MP.</p>
<p>It’s an incredibly weird system at first – you’ve got to essentially let the attacks hit you to trigger the dodge, which goes against muscle memory from every other game with a parry system. You’ve got some minor options to mix up your combat abilities, too – as you explore Shibuya and complete side quests, you’ll find graffiti across the city that you can acquire and convert into usable combat abilities.</p>
<p>You can tell they really wanted to emulate the feeling of ability pins from The World Ends With You with the way these graffiti pieces are rendered and the collectible nature of them. Since every character can equip any ability art, you’ve got the opportunity to mix and match in a surprisingly open-ended way that helped massage the combat loop into a more satisfying place once I got way deeper into the game.</p>

<p>The most impressive part of Reynatis to me is the attention to detail in recreating Shibuya as your main explorable environment. Streets are full of iconic, real-life shops and landmarks from the vibrant Japanese city ward, and it’s the kind of game world I could pause and take a stroll through in-between missions just to soak in all the atmosphere. It’s just a shame that same attention to detail isn’t present for other environments in the game.</p>
<p>When story missions or challenges take you into the fog-gated world of Another, you’re basically tossed into copy-pasted forest and desert dungeons that lack any sense of style or substance. Even the music in these regions is a bit of a snore, which is heartbreaking when you consider how important music is to the games that seemed to so heavily inspire Reynatis.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lorn's Lure Review - Call of the Void]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lorns-lure-review-call-of-the-void.986910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my favorite manga of all time is <em>Blame!</em>, a somewhat niche title by the masterful Tsutomu Nihei. The way Nihei crafts his worlds, letting visuals speak more than the very characters in his works, it's something unique to the medium of manga. Most of all, however, it's how he is able to portray scale in <em>Blame!</em> and his various other works that amaze me.</p>
<p><em>Lorn's Lure</em> wears its inspirations on its sleeve, and chiefly among them is <em>Blame!</em>. It's a mysterious first-person <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/platformer">platformer</a> that prefers to show rather than tell, and also perfectly captures the unfathomably large scale of megastructures. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> might have niche appeal, but like <em>Blame!</em>, those who consume its content will absolutely love it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-4.jpg?itok=WFQCl1wr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-4.jpg?itok=dfHwlT9L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe me when I say you CAN and will find a way to descend from this.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lorn's Lure</em>, a Precision Platformer</h2>
<p>Armed with nothing but your own body and two climbing pickaxes, your objective is to continue onward. You're being lured by something -- perhaps your own curiosity -- but this megastructure that comprises <em>Lorn's Lure</em> beckons. Descending and ascending incomprehensible obstacles is the fun of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>. You never know what's ahead, even if you see a giant <em>thing</em> in the distance.</p>
<p>Often times, you'll descend (or ascend) via thin rebar and wires jutting out at precarious heights, and you'll have to make plenty of daring jumps, too. In this regard, <em>Lorn's Lure</em> feels like a precision platformer, as finesse is the key. Yet, the platforming in this title, despite being a first-person game, is quite smooth and not in the least bit slippery or difficult to control.</p>
<p>Your standard walking speed is pretty fast, too, but if you want, you can slow down on thin beams so you don't stray over the edge. Nonetheless, this is a game where you need to take as many minuscule footholds as you can get, and you'll be surprised by how generous <em>Lorn's Lure</em> can be despite the unpredictable situations you're put in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-6.jpg?itok=B5chkKLn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-6.jpg?itok=ihPvTbdA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That tower? You can climb it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Failure is Part of the Process in <em>Lorn's Lure</em></h2>
<p>Of course, failure is inevitable, but even in failure, <em>Lorn's Lure</em> is gracious and respectful to players. Checkpoints are scattered throughout -- not just a few, but dozens upon dozens of them, even on small perches -- so plummeting to your death isn't a huge issue. By pressing one button, you can immediately restart back to that checkpoint, making most situations manageable.</p>
<p>So yes, you'll find yourself falling to death quite a bit, and if the game detects you've fallen for something like three seconds, it'll usually immediately reset -- these falls aren't survivable, after all. You can sort of finesse your way across what seems like impossible scenarios by abusing the stamina system in <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-5.jpg?itok=Tj2oSfhx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-5.jpg?itok=pTVnxnp6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pipes are a Tsutomu Nihei staple, so of course they make an appearance in <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Jumping around and landing on a slightly slanted edge will give you just the reprieve you need to restore some stamina and either latch onto a wall with your pickaxes or make a second jump to the next ledge. Stamina depletes while you climb or do just about anything else besides walking, so maintaining this and making sure it doesn't expire before you land is key.</p>
<p>Your job of getting to the end of these massive levels, well, it gets easier, and it doesn't. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> does an excellent job at giving players new abilities to utilize as time goes on. It's just the right amount of spice to mitigate what could have been a tedious game. Abilities like dash jets, a mid-air dash, allows for the levels to get even more creative as you progress.</p>
<p>Players can "tic-tac" off of walls (essentially, wall jumping) for some stamina and bridge larger gaps, or eventually an improved jump lets you cross yet even <em>larger</em> chasms later on. I can't commend developer Rubeki Games enough for adding new abilities as time goes on, since it introduces new obstacles even when these abilities make things more convenient.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-screen-2.jpg?itok=UzXTxeKk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-screen-2.jpg?itok=R5DN0Ts0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For what purpose does this object serve?</figcaption></figure><h2>Oh, the Places You'll Go</h2>
<p>Let's talk about level design -- Rubeki Games is insanely creative in the way they make vast, open spaces and insurmountable obstacles. In one moment, you'll have the feelings of megalophobia from the sheer scale of the objects you're climbing -- in the next, you might have the overwhelming pressure of claustrophobia bearing down on you.</p>
<p>I already touched on scaling giant walls, either by ascending or descending, but I didn't talk about one level in particular. Early on, gameplay does a bit of a shift and throws players into a complex, seemingly endless series of rocky tunnels. Having to squeeze through tiny holes in a dark environment to move forward, it's an uncomfortable experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/screenshot-lorns-lure.jpg?itok=wLVnOflN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/screenshot-lorns-lure.jpg?itok=7-_tywRz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What a daunting climb!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Lorn's Lure</em> excels at making its player uncomfortable, and it's an experience that you can't find in many games. But besides just the feeling of being in a giant (or cramped) space, you have mysterious, abandoned cities, sunken temples, and gigantic canyons that seem to defy reason.</p>
<p>These levels come to life with exceptional use of lighting, fog, and creativity. More often than not, I'd get done climbing down a gigantic building or network of pipes, look up and be amazed by how far I had come.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-1.jpg?itok=CZjSASY_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-1.jpg?itok=2xVRvo4Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The abyss beckons!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lorn's Lure </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Seeing how big some of these environments are, one might think it's easy to get lost. There were times when, yes, it became very hard to intuit where the game wanted me to go, and that was frustrating. Thankfully, there's a handy hint system in <em>Lorn's Lure</em> that does a solid job most of the time, even if it's not perfect.</p>
<p>Besides that, I took a methodical and slow approach to my platforming, and while the finale to <em>Lorn's Lure</em> is thrilling, it also felt too fast-paced and grueling for its own good. The final gauntlet will definitely test your patience and felt inconsistent with the methodical pace I went through the levels preceding it.</p>
<p>No doubt, <em>Lorn's Lure</em> is an unconventional game. It defies the ordinary, which perfectly complements the mysterious and foreboding nature of the game's looming megastructures and elusive narrative. I have nothing but respect for the way <em>Lorn's Lure</em> portrays itself, and those who play it to the end will most definitely count it as an indie gem.&nbsp;</p>

There have been novels, comics, anime, and even an audio drama showcasing each of the party members in <em>The Veilguard</em>.

Here are the three major <em>Dragon Age</em> extended universe projects BioWare says you may want to catch up on before <em>The Veilguard</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-recommend-id="image://a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-format="jpg" data-width="650" data-height="365" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An ogre towers over Varric." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An ogre towers over Varric." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dark Horse Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-recommend-id="image://a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-format="jpg" data-width="650" data-height="365" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An ogre towers over Varric." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Two of these are pretty much direct prologues to <em>The Veilguard</em>, the first of which is <em>The Missing</em>.

This short story anthology was released in 2020 and features several stories about different characters throughout the universe, including some <em>Veilguard</em> companions like Neve and Lucanis.

<p>The upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2 will be console exclusive to the PlayStation 5 (PS5) for at least a year. The reveal comes via the game’s latest trailer from PlayStation.</p>



<p>At the end of the trailer — you can watch it below — there is a message for players. In a short and simple statement, the video reads, “Not available on other formats until 10.08.2025.”</p>



<p>That means those hoping for an Xbox release will have to wait at least until next year. That said, there’s no confirmation that it will come to Xbox when the window opens up.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the new trailer itself, it’s all about the game’s immersion on PS5 (as the title would suggest). Specifically, it looks at the way the game will utilize the features available on the DualSense controller. That includes things like Adaptive Triggers, Haptic Feedback, and a dynamic lightbar  for things like your health. There will be 3D Audio support.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 remake launches October 8 for PS5 and PC. Players have the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">option to buy</a> the Standard Edition for $69.99 or the Deluxe Edition for $79.99. Those who pick up the Deluxe Edition can starting playing starting October 6 as well get a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and more.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games recently added new anti-cheating measures to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-pc-review/1900-6415959/" data-ref-id="1900-6415959">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> in order to address long-standing issues with cheaters in the game. But that move has apparently had some unexpected consequences for gamers who play the title on Steam Deck. GTA 5 is now listed as "unsupported" by Steam Deck, and it may be down to a dispute between Rockstar and Valve.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248585/gta-v-steam-deck-battleye" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the Steam Deck compatibility message that comes up with Grand Theft Auto 5 states that "this game's anti-cheat is not configured to support Steam Deck." It also warns that "some or all of the game" doesn't function. What it doesn't say is that the part that doesn't work is Grand Theft Auto Online.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ#:~:text=Steam%20Deck%20does%20not%20support%20BattlEye%20for%20GTA%20Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Rockstar writes that Steam Deck doesn't support its anti-cheating BattlEye software for GTA Online. But as noted by The Verge, other titles on Steam Deck have successfully utilized BattleEye. Rockstar has seemingly decided not to work with Valve on the issue despite telling affected gamers that "all technical support questions should be directed to Valve’s Steam Deck support content and community."</p><p>For now, Grand Theft Auto Online functionality has been removed from Steam Deck by Rockstar. The rest of GTA 5's story mode is still playable despite the "unsupported" tag from Valve. It's possible that a solution between the two sides can be worked out in the future. But for the moment, this is where things stand. In the meantime, gamers are already looking ahead to the long-awaited sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-might-not-benefit-from-ps5-pro-in-ways-that-you-expect/1100-6526459/" data-ref-id="1100-6526459">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is scheduled to arrive in Fall 2025.</p>

<p>The good news is that because of this cloud-centric approach, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-requires-fraction-of-storage-space-versus-last-game/1100-6526578/" data-ref-id="1100-6526578">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will have a much smaller footprint</a> on your storage device.

Entitled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the title was actually a prequel wrapped up in a mini-game, a means to tell more of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1433140/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre/">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> story as it would appear later in the titular game from 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The aim of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was to prelude the story of Maria Flores through snapshots from her camera, leading up to the events of the game. Lending insight into that is Gun Interactive president and CEO Wes Keltner, who is joined by executive producer Ismael Vicens, to explain their thought process behind the design of this minigame, and why those to deliver a narrative in this specific way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer: What were your design goals in adding a photography mode to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wes Keltner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We knew our game was taking place a few months before the 1974 film. In order to provide as much story as we could, while still making a multiplayer-only game, we began kicking around the idea of an ARG. We wanted to tell the story of Maria, why she was in Texas, and what happened to her. The answers to these questions would kick off our multiplayer game. It was the story before the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our creative director, Ronnie Hobbs, had already written into the bio of Maria that she was a photographer. She went to this area of Texas to take pictures of the bluebonnets and other spring flowers. We were also interested in tying the camera Hitchhiker uses in the film back into our game. Where did he get that camera? This was our chance to do something interesting. So we created this smaller, PC-only experience that allowed players to use that very camera to take pictures of flowers. But with each picture they were looming closer and closer to their end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why use photography to deliver narrative?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keltner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: If you're making a smaller game or experience, you have to start thinking about keeping the systems and mechanics somewhat simple. This isn't a fully scoped-out game, but a smaller, almost demo-like experience. Focusing on the camera was a great mechanic that was somewhat easy to implement while still giving the players something to concentrate on. It allows them to look at things closer, with intent. And honestly, it slowed them down. And as horror game creators, if I can get you to slow down, I got you! I can scare you when you slow down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What camera or photography features did you feel were essential and which were left on the cutting room floor?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ismael Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: When we were first discussing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, something that we felt was worthwhile to implement was the idea of retaining the aspect of the photographer behind the camera. When other games enter a photography mode, they let the players move the camera around and place it more or less where they wish. We have a few photographers at the office, and we understand the feeling of planting your feet and finding your shot—of walking and suddenly spotting something in that moment that you want to capture. So we wanted to make sure that was present in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to really put the player in Maria's shoes, so to speak. With The Museum, given the scope and expanse of the levels, and how they recreated an iconic location from the film, we provided the player with a little bit more freedom.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">In both, we decided on a very stripped down feature set, because ultimately, when you're walking and shooting, you're thinking more about what you're pointed at, how you want to highlight it, and how you're going to compose your shot. So we limited ourselves primarily to changing focal length, and adjusting focus. This way, players are thinking about the same things someone in that moment would be thinking about, and approaching their photos in the same way.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It seems as though many photography modes are just a modification of the natural camera view that players use in the game, but with added tools. What was the technical process of implementation like?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Beyond the natural game camera, when you implement a photography mode, there are additional technical hurdles that you have to concern yourself with as a developer. You have to ensure that the camera doesn't pass into solid objects, or expose an area of the game world that may not have been intended to be seen. These expand the testing burden for integrating such a mode—hence why you don't see it with every title.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">The process of changing focal depth is fairly simple. As a developer, you're constantly manipulating that during the process of making a game as you experiment with what will look best during gameplay, so those controls are already present. Even capturing or freezing a moment on screen is simple—these are things that are baked into a game already. So the majority of the technical process comes down to the additional features you lay on top, and how much freedom you afford the user.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Are photography modes just a matter of clever UI?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I think it can vary wildly, depending on the specifics of the mode, and the intention of the mode's placement in a title. In some titles, photography mode exposes huge amounts of controls for players—the ability to spawn and manipulate objects, or dramatically change the light sources in a scene, etc. This is obviously much more than a clever UI; it's enabling a user to create content for themselves or others that can tell a story.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">For us, we could definitely say that perhaps it is just clever UI, but even just layering on UI creates a different feeling for the player. It allows us to do some things that support the story we want to tell, or the emotions we want to evoke. As a crude example, in the moment when the shutter closes, we've got the ability to suddenly change what you see through the camera, letting us startle the player in that instant. And because we've created specific photos as goals, we have the benefit of knowing what the player is looking at, making this even more effective. These are tools we don't have in uninterrupted gameplay—they rely on the presence of that UI, of that tool and of those goals for the player.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can video game photography teach us anything about real-life photography?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I think there definitely could be a time and place where video game photography could teach someone about real-life photography—there are a ton of "simulator" style games on the market, and that area is ripe for educating users about some of the basics. We've focused primarily on photography as a design tool for us to transmit some narrative to the player, or to solve puzzles. However, in the Museum mode we have, we do encourage users to really soak in the details, no matter how small, of the world we've created. In that, perhaps, we can remind someone that a photo doesn't often have to be about the grand subject or perfect moment, but about the little details that make up our world, and how they stack one on top of the other to create our perceptions and deepen our appreciation of the world around us. Every layer—the beauty, horror, textures, and more.</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How is our portrayal of photography limited or enhanced by the medium?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: For us, the portrayal of the photographer being in the moment is enhanced in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the short experience where you play Maria. Through the combination of art, sound, music, and linear narrative, you go from a character appreciating and experiencing the beauty of her surroundings through the lens of a camera to being disturbed, startled, and ultimately terrified while capturing pictures. So for us it was less about representing a true experience of photography, and more about placing the player in the mindset of that photographer.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What design features can help us achieve an authentic experience?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: "Authentic experience" is a difficult thing to pin down, because we need to define what authenticity means in the specific experience being crafted. Are we seeking to replicate the authentic experience of taking photos? Or trying to let players craft and capture a moment that replicates the authentic feeling of playing the game, albeit in a still image? If the former, is the title live, and in the moment the same way we take photos in life, or is it still authentic if we pause the game and let the player manipulate the camera, as so many titles do?</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">The best we can ever do as developers is think about the experience we want out players to have with every feature—what emotion we want to evoke, what reaction we want to receive—and design for that, while knowing that what a player does is ultimately out of our hands. In our case, we wanted to achieve a few things with photography in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and later in The Museum. We wanted to put you in the mindset and shoes of a special character in our game. Then we wanted to use the confinement and action of lining up and taking photos to unnerve the player and start to tell a story. In The Museum, we wanted the player to appreciate the lengths we went to to replicate iconic locations from the films while also encouraging them to solve puzzles—and yes, to scare them again!</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Should authenticity even be the goal?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keltner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Aiming for authenticity is always our goal. In fact it's paramount to our games for two very important reasons. We are entrusted with a globally recognized IP and we don't take that lightly. It's an immense responsibility and we want to make sure we treat it with the respect it deserves. A big portion of that respect is being authentic to the film. Assuring it feels, sounds, and looks like that 1974 film. And I think we pulled that off. The second reason is more of a horror design philosophy and that's immersion. It's our job to keep you immersed in the moment. If something pulls you out because it's incorrect or not authentic, it's very hard for us to pull you back in. It's much harder for me to yell "boo" and it scares you if you're not really present in the game. And authenticity keeps you present and allows you to feel a bit lost in the world.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Community Editorial Coordinator, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Holly Green has been in games media for fifteen years, having previously worked as a reporter and critic at a variety of outlets.

		<p>You know how Goro Majima has an eye patch, and how pirates stereotypically have eye patches too? Well, what if Majima was a pirate? In Hawaii? That’s the basic premise of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, the self explanatory spin-off coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 28th February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCmDF0NqZQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Half a year after teaming up with Kiryu for the battle at the Millenium Tower, Goro Majima washes up on a remote island with no memories at all, not even his name. He embarks on a new adventure with teenage islander Noah to regain those memories and get ahead in this topsy-turvy world.</p>
<p>That will take them in conflict with criminals, modern-day pirates (who dress like ye olde pirates – and other scoundrels, who are all chasing after a legendary treasure. Thankfully you’ll have your own pirate crew backing you up, with real-time cannon battles against other ships on the open seas, before switching up to hand-to-hand after boarding their ships. Here you can switch between Majima’s Mad Dog and piratical Sea Dog fighting styles, the latter letting him wield a cutlass and other buccaneer gear.</p>
<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series, which will be helmed by former&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>showrunner Adi Shankar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set to debut in April 2025,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will, of course, revolve around the adventures of longtime series protagonist Dante. If you're not a fan of the 2013 reboot, you'll be pleased to know we're very much in classic&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>territory when it comes to Dante's design.</p>
<p>Shankar first announced the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania">back in 2018</a>, and we got our first look at the animation style and tone of the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series">last year</a>, but this new trailer gives a more involved glimpse into the show's setting and characteristically stylish action sequences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/devil-may-cry-animated-series-dante_0.jpg?itok=P5hsLL69 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/devil-may-cry-animated-series-dante_0.jpg?itok=e3CqiPMv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that sure does look like Dante alright.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer doesn't give a ton away about what the story will be, but it does show Dante leaping out of an exploding plane, battling demons, and, of course, retrieving his pistols from a pizza box, so it's definitely&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>.</p>
<p>You can take a look at Netflix's trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series right here. We don't know exactly when it debuts yet, but this trailer should get you excited for it, at the very least.</p>

<h2>What else is Netflix working on in the gaming space?</h2>
<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, we also got to see some of the other things Netflix is working on when it comes to gaming-adjacent shows.</p>
<p>For a start, Netflix is working alongside CD Projekt Red for another animated series based on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, although whether this one will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-edgerunners-brilliantly-uses-elements-from-game">an anime like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-edgerunners-brilliantly-uses-elements-from-game">Edgerunners</a>&nbsp;</em>or a Western-produced show remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Netflix also revealed the release dates for the second season of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>adaptation&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>, which saw its first season launch back in 2021 to critical acclaim, prompting Riot to include one of its most beloved characters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">as a champion in&nbsp;<em>League</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first "Act" will premier on November 9th, followed by the second on November 16th and the third on November 23rd. Presumably, each Act will contain multiple episodes, although we don't know exactly how many there will be yet.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more on these Netflix projects, as well as all other things gaming adaptation-related.</p>

Colin Farrell plays the titular Penguin (whose name has, strangely, been changed from Oswald Cobblepott to Oz Cobb to try and “ground” the series) as mesmerizing and manipulative in this first scene, and he only gets better from there, propelling <em>The Penguin </em>forward like a motor-mouthed machine, at times eliciting empathy, at others disgust. Farrell is so effective, you can practically hear his name ringing out during next year’s awards season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Penguin</em> picks up right after the events of <em>The Batman</em>: Carmine Falcone is dead, the Riddler has flooded Gotham City, and crime is exponentially up in the wake of the disaster. Sensing a power vacuum and knowing that Falcone’s drug-addled son, Alberto, is due to take the throne, Oz immediately heads over to the family’s nightclub—the Iceberg Lounge—to raid the safe. When he’s discovered by an angry Alberto, he deflects, offering his condolences and a drink in Carmine’s honor. </p><p>Oz effortlessly manipulates Alberto; within minutes the two of them are half-drunk, reminiscing about the old mafioso until he offers the troubled young man some “drops”— a narcotic that you drop in your eye that induces a state of euphoria (or paranoia). As Alberto gets high, Oz tells him the story of the mob boss who ran his neighborhood when he was young, and how the entire community adored the man, mourning his death with a massive parade. But as Alberto begins to feel the narcotic set in, he doesn’t take Oz’s anecdote as a lovely reminder of his father’s legacy, he (somewhat rightfully, as you’ll quickly learn) picks up on the foot soldier’s desire to ascend the ranks. And so, he begins ruthlessly mocking him.<br></p><p>Alberto unleashes a flurry of insults at Oz from an armchair a few feet away with so much vitriol and hatred you pity the poor guy—you can see he’s faced this countless times before, this endless barrage of barbs based on his physical appearance. You see how it’s sunk deep into his soul, twisting him like gnarled tree roots, darkening his perspective on the world. Right when it all becomes too much, when Alberto seems like he won’t stop, right when you’re practically begging for someone to step in and end it, Oz casually pulls a gun and shoots Alberto point blank several times, barely moving in his seat. My mouth drops, an “Oh shit” escapes me that’s so loud our managing editor Carolyn Petit looks up from her seat several desks away.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-recommend-id="image://b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-recommend-id="image://b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here is where Farrell is especially spectacular: in the immediate aftermath, he lets out a barking, cruel laugh. He’s bested Alberto, he’s silenced someone insulting his looks, his intelligence, his honor. He holds the power. But that harsh laugh dies on his lips, and realization flits across his scarred face—this is the new head of the Falcone crime family, and he just shot him in the club they own. His eyes dart back and forth and I watch as a wave of emotions wash over him: frustration at his knee-jerk reaction, lingering anger at Alberto goading him into violence, fear at the repercussions.<br></p><p>“Oh fu-” Oz laments, his expletive cut off by the bold title card: <em>The Penguin</em>.<br></p><p>Farrell is <em>this</em> good for the entire episode (and series, to be quite honest). His voice, his visage, his physicality are all unrecognizable, and his dedicated adoption of this twisted, tortured soul offers a nuanced performance you so rarely see in a comic-book-inspired series. In one scene, he can make you let out a shocked peal of laughter (I choked on my coffee during a rant about the amount of pickles on his bodega sandwich), and in another he’ll make you despise him for manipulating a young, impressionable kid into doing his bidding. It’s an absolute masterclass in acting, and a delight to watch—and it only gets better from there.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fpenguin%2F5756c2bf-36f8-4890-b1f9-ef168f1d8e9c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fpenguin%2F5756c2bf-36f8-4890-b1f9-ef168f1d8e9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> episode two airs Sunday, September 29 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have revealed the next Like a Dragon game, and this time, everyone's favorite Yakuza loose cannon Goro Majima will be the star of it. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will see an amnesiac Majima reinvent himself as a pirate captain searching for a legendary treasure, an adventure that will see him cross swords with Hawaiian pirate gangs. The first trailer doesn't show much in terms of gameplay, but it does give a good look at Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's cast, the actors voicing them, and a release date of February 28, 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD_K05bgjSg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JD_K05bgjSg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the RGG Summit, producer Ryosuke Horii explained that the spin-off has a "very different" battle design when compared to the recent mainline games that use a turn-based RPG game. "It's fast-paced, and it has a lot of Majima's uniqueness, that’s what we aimed for," Horii said. Majima will be able to switch between two fighting styles--Mad Dog and Sea Dog--utilizing his signature Yakuza fighting moves and a weapons-based system where he goes all in on the pirate theme.</p><p>Additionally, Majima can take part in several minigames, something that has become a staple of Yakuza and Like a Dragon games over the years. Fans of the franchise have been spoiled for choice recently, as RGG Studio has steadily pumped out several games. Since 2020, the developer has released two mainline entries in the series, a remake of Like a Dragon: Ishin, and the spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6aJQ9hDFxk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T6aJQ9hDFxk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The most-recent entry, Like a Dragon: infinite Wealth, was released in January and saw current series protagonist Kasuga Ichiban team up with Kazuma Kiryu to explore Hawaii, uncover a major conspiracy, and crack some skulls along the way.</p><p>"It's the best of both Yakuza worlds coming together for a story about life, legacy, and the daunting realities of the world we live in--but, more than anything, atonement and the various forms it can take.

		<p>Sony has released PlayStation 5 system update 24.06-10.01.00, targeting game performance and stability, and for once, having such minimal patch notes are more than fine with us!</p>
<p>The download weighs in at around 1.2GB, with the only patch note being:</p>


<ul>
<li>We’ve improved system software performance and stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This update, however, comes after a week of certain games experiencing graphics issues and full blown crashes, most significantly Final Fantasy 16 – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/square-enix-investigate-final-fantasy-16-crashes-and-graphics-after-ps5-system-update/">Square Enix acknowledged the issues</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub-personalised-3d-audio-more/">Last week’s PS5 firmware update</a> laid the foundations for a global rollout of a new customisable Welcome Hub, and direct party invite sharing with links. Additionally, the personalised 3D audio system that was in testing for the last few months with users has now gone live for all players.</p>
<p>However, console system updates also include a lot of behind the scenes changes that can affect game performance, providing system-level optimisations for specific games, new API hooks and more – they’re similar to installing driver updates on PC, or new versions of Windows. Sony never details the changes made to that level of granularity, but something clearly went awry with last week’s update, affecting a handful of games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe.986832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ten days ago, publisher Focus Home Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 had sold over two million units a single day after launching globally.</p>
<p>Following up on that success, GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1837059344308871651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1837059344308871651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that, according to GSD data, Space Marine 2 had the second best-selling launch of 2024 in Europe so far, beating the likes of The Last of Us 2: Remastered, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Tekken 8, F1 24, WWE 24, Star Wars Outlaws, and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The only game to sell more was Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>There's a caveat to that, though. Palworld and Black Myth: Wukong, arguably the two most successful game launches of the year, aren't considered in the data because GSD does not track their developers. Considering that Palworld had surpassed 15 million units as of February and that Black Myth: Wukong reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke 20 million units sold</a> in less than a month, it's easy to imagine the games kicking Space Marine 2 off the podium.</p>
<p>Still, Saber Interactive's latest release has been a success so far, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is more on the way</a>. Season 1 is set to add support for Ultrawide displays, Private PvE lobbies, and a Sparring Arena in the Battle Barge; Season 2 will introduce new PvE missions, a new enemy, a new Lethal difficulty, and a new weapon; Season 3 is also adding new PvE missions, a new PvP game mode, new PvP arenas, a new enemy, PvE Prestige ranks, and an expansion of the Battle Barge. To round up the first year of post-launch additions, Season 4 will introduce a Horde Mode, a new enemy, and a new weapon.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will also be <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-dlss3-fsr-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation on PC, boosting frame rates.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-stars-a-swashbuckling-majima.986829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced <i>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</i>, the next installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>series, and it'll let you play as Kazuma Kiryu's friend and rival Goro Majima.</p>
<p>The game was revealed during today's RGG Summit, and it seemingly takes place alongside this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">hugely successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, showing what happened to Goro Majima while the events of that game were unfolding.</p>
<p>The trailer is narrated by Majima himself, who relates his experience of being washed up on the beach of an island off the coast of Hawaii. It's not Nele Island, but that's where Majima is trying to get to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-boarding.jpg?itok=H52lHSZr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-boarding.jpg?itok=3WvuhlXG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>is aiming to be the pirate fantasy&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones&nbsp;</em>never could.</figcaption></figure><p>Waking up with no memory of his identity, Majima is saved by a young boy called Noah and his baby tiger companion, and the two quickly become embroiled in what Majima calls "an all-out war for treasures unimaginable".</p>
<p>There's not much gameplay to speak of in the announcement trailer; it's mostly setting up the characteristically outlandish premise and highlighting some of the larger-than-life characters you'll meet throughout&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, not least Majima himself.</p>
<p>We do, however, get to see a brief clip of a bicycle minigame towards the end, and we also get a glimpse of the game's combat, which, it seems, will return to the action stylings of earlier games rather than espousing the turn-based combat of Ichiban's adventures.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>Per the Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>will also offer "exhilarating" ship battles, as well as the chance to assemble your very own pirate crew. In short, if you, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">like many others</a>, were disappointed by&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, this looks like the pirate fantasy for you.</p>
<p><i>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</i>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0177-PPSA24478_00-MAINGAME00000000/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/9ns00hqcz0cj" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the best PC specs for budding pilots hoping to get into the cockpit when Fight Simulator 2024 releases in November.</p>
<p>By utilising cloud data streaming, the install size has shrunk to a petite <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1837036417165197497">30GB</a>. However, Microsoft reckons you'll need a stonking 64GB RAM to run at the "ideal" spec, along with 12GB of VRAM, an RTX 4080, the 14700K, and a 100mbps internet connection.</p>

<p>The minimum specs are likely much more attainable, however, recommending a minimum 10mbps and 16GB RAM.</p>
<p>All versions will need Direct X Version DX12, though, and 50GB of storage available.</p> <div>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> is already shaping up to be pretty spectacular, but don't forget that for the very first time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-let-you-climb-out-your-plane-walk-a-trail-and-watch-the-sunset">players will be able to eject out of the cockpit</a> - uh, safely, I hope - to wander around.</p>
<p>As well as every airport, the team has now added glider airports, every oil rig, and every lighthouse in the world. That's alongside "hundreds of species of animals that run around", and it's also simulating "every ship on Earth" via their transponder signals - all of which you'll be able to land on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/20/what-we-played-the-plucky-squire-astro-bot-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s definitely ramping up to Christmas, and the reveal of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-limited-edition-30th-anniversary-ps5-consoles-look-fantastic/">30th Anniversary PlayStation consoles</a> in classic grey has reopened the question of whether a PS5 Pro is now an essential purchase. Because it’s a nice retro grey. Whatever your feelings about a piece of tech that lives inside a closed TV cabinet, it’s all very cool, and nice to see Sony going the extra mile by making literally everything grey.</p>
<p>When I’ve not been looking at pictures of consoles, I’ve been playing the wonderful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-plucky-squire-review/">The Plucky Squire</a>, the calming Caravan Sand Witch, Star Wars Outlaws and a bunch of other stuff inbetween.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played some demos including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/17/slopecrashers-preview-bird-and-board/">Slopecrashers</a>, Hush Hush High, and Pairs &amp; Perils. He’s also continued his playthrough of Final Fantasy XVI, saying, “I’m at a stage where it has now opened up after the first few hours. I’m enjoying it a lot. I also finished Beyond Galaxyland for review and that will be published next week.”</p>
<p>It’s also been some Star Wars Outlaws for <strong>Ade</strong>, who tells us, “I’ve been really enjoying it! It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the original films. Best Star Wars-y thing in years. Which, considering the low bar set by the recent TV shows, isn’t really saying much… nonetheless, Outlaws is very good by any standard”.</p>


<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Spider-Man 2, though he’s not been totally sold by it, “It seems to be more of the same so I didn’t bother playing much”, he continues, “I’ve also been playing Alan Wake Remastered which I finished, v good, Transformers Fall of Cybertron, just because, and Astro Bot. The God of War level in Astro Bot is better than the entirety of Ragnarok. Fact.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has also been enjoying an Astro Bot love in, “It has taken up most of my time this week and has been another perfect game for PlayStation Portal. Naturally, I’m going for a completionist run – although I rarely chase after trophies nowadays, Astro Bot offers some major incentives for those wanting that sweet PlayStation nostalgia rush.</p>
<p>That’s not all though, because “Speaking of trophies, now that the TimeSplitters trilogy on PS4 and PS5 support them, I’ve been playing the first game in the series. I’ve never played it properly despite sinking countless hours into both sequels and it still holds up pretty nicely. The PS2 emulation’s rewind feature adds a handy thematic twist, allowing me to effortlessly rerun levels and pull myself back from death’s door. This has been particularly useful during the nail-baiting challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> was one Bot from 100% completion on Astro when the game crashed. He cried, “I have to redo 7 of the hard levels!<br>
Beyond that I have played [[heavily redacted]]. It’s pretty cool, if you like that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing something he describes as, “A perfect party of nostalgia and homage that really pays tribute to the great games of the past while introducing fascinating new modes of control and interaction – but enough about Golden Axe: Beast Rider… More seriously, Astro Bot is just pure gaming joy distilled into an experience that constantly keeps me smiling. Beast Rider can fuck right off with its awful controls and instant death pits. I have been working through some reviews so expect What the Car and Squirrel With a Gun soon whilst another one is possibly embargoed but is a remaster of one of the most neglected Wii exclusives and the review will drop next week.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has caught up on the main story in Zenless Zone Zero, played and beaten Thank Goodness You’re Here and also Clickolding, and he’s been playing some Fortnite too! <strong>Tef</strong> had a little gaming time to himself, telling us, “I played a bit of that new Warhammer game. Warhammer….. Boltgun? Got to say, the graphics are really something.”</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Gamoc</strong> mostly played Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag, along with some other bits. He says, “I love Black Flag despite the stupid stuff, like trailing missions and boat stealth missions, I was worried revisiting would be rough because of those.”</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played? And are you tempted by any of the 30th Anniversary PlayStation gear? Maybe just a DualSense…</p>

It launches February 28, 2025..</p><p>A lengthy reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szhdoaEG21w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> showed Majima washed up on the beach of Rich Island, near Hawaii, looking worse for wear and helped by a child with a pet tiger. Majima introduced the clip himself as a story taking place six months prior, asking how the heck he ended up on a beach.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Reveal Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>It looks to directly feed off the story of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, with Majima dealing with repercussions caused by Ichiban Kasuga's involvement with the cult of Palekana on Nele Island. The trailer also showed Majima becoming a pirate captain himself.</p><p>Gameplay released showed Majima fighting on the main Hawaii map from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth alongside on ships and other new areas. Majima can fight in either the Mad Dog Style or the Sea Dog Style, and players can jump for the first time in the Yakuza series.</p><p>Yakuza fans have been awaiting this game's reveal for what feels like a long time. Even though the last mainline game, the colossal Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, arrived as the last mainline entry in January, RGG Studio has become known for its rapid releases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the last five years, for example, it released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p>Fans have been trying to figure out what this new entry would be since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-summit-showcase-to-reveal-next-yakuzalike-a-dragon-game-in-september">Sega announced the RGG Summit in August</a>, whether it would be the next mainline Yakuza/Like a Dragon entry, another spin-off game like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, another remake like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review">Yakuza: Kiwami</a> or Like a Dragon: Ishin, another game from spin-off series <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgment</a>, or something else entirely.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If that seems like an odd pairing, there's actually a clear crossover. Metaphor features a red-headed elven knight called Hulkenberg, while Nico Hülkenberg is one of the drivers for the Haas F1 team.</p>
<p>Naturally, then, both Hulkenberg and the game's protagonist will adorn the noses of cars driven by Hülkenberg and teammate Kevin Magnussen respectively.</p>

<p>A grand high fantasy anime RPG and an F1 race fuelled by modern technology don't appear to have a lot in common. Atlus, though, would beg to differ.</p>
<p>"Overcoming fear and anxiety is a central theme in Metaphor: ReFantazio, and being featured on the racecars of Nico Hülkenberg and Kevin Magnussen - drivers known for defying the impossible - perfectly mirrors our game, where players beat the odds in their chase for the crown in the Royal Tournament," said Irvin Ducournau, director of marketing at Atlus.</p>
<p>"Partnering with MoneyGram Haas F1 Team ahead of the Singapore GP is a natural fit, as the high-stakes nature of Formula 1 aligns seamlessly with the competitive election mechanic in the game, where players gain followers in their own race for victory."</p>
<p>Ah, now it all makes sense!</p>

<p>Mark Morrell, the Haas team's director of marketing also commented: "This hotly anticipated game is visually spectacular and filled with all the speed, suspense and excitement you would expect from a Grand Prix weekend. It's our first partnership of this kind and we're looking forward to sharing the exhilarating world of Metaphor: ReFantazio with racing fans."</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-is-far-more-than-just-persona-in-fantasy-clothing-it-could-be-a-new-high-bar-for-the-genre">hands-on with Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> last month, and while I can't say I spent any time racing, I certainly got a taste of its competitive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-fantasy-election-adapts-personas-social-gameplay">election storyline</a>.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the next game from Atlus, the creators of the Persona and Shin Megami Tensei series, which launches on 11th October across Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new video shared online a few hours ago provides a better look at the Nintendo Switch 2 design and screen, comparing it with the current system as well.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xnzxnz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">小宁子 XNZ</a>, features a 3D-printed version of the console based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">recent leaks</a>, providing a much better look at it. The size and the bigger screen are obviously the biggest differences with the current Nintendo consoles, but every other feature in the design suggests that the upcoming console is indeed an evolution of its predecessor.</p>
<p><iframe title="【全网独家爆料】Switch 2 来了！你想知道的一切全在这里！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UArxpvOZV5M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the system having been in the works for quite some time, the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. As such, there's little that is currently known for certain about the system other than the fact that it is in the works. According to rumors, its performance should be close to the Xbox Series S, potentially with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality</a> if the system will indeed feature the rumored 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM. Also, the console is said to support NVIDIA DLSS and Ray Reconstrunction, which should give the system an edge, although it is expected it will run games at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">a lower framerate</a> than the Steam Deck due to its CPU.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-interview-discussing-setting-gameplay-pc-features/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan was among many games placed under the spotlight during this year's Gamescom, and for good reason. The game in development by Neople is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly promising</a>, thanks to an interesting setting, high production values, and a hardcore action role-playing game experience inspired by the Souls series, whose quality feels quite close to that of its illustrious inspiration.</p>
<p>After trying out The First Berserker: Khazan, I had the chance to talk with game director JunHo Lee and Neople CEO Myeongjin Yun about the game's settings, mechanics, and PC-exclusive features like NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Deep Dive on Weapons, Action, and Combat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ddf0s9PaAnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan is based on the Dungeon and Fighter series, which is not very well known in the West. Is the game a good introduction to the franchise?</strong></p>
<p>We love Dungeon and Fighter, and we have been playing it for a long time. We started The First Berserker: Khazan project because we wanted more people to enjoy the series, and we focused mostly on two things during development. We wanted to make a game that fans of Dungeon Fighter would enjoy, but also those who didn't know much about the series. We put a lot of effort into appealing to this untapped player base and making them more interested in the series, so the game is most definitely a good starting point.</p>
<p><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan feels a lot like the Dark Souls series. In the past few years, we have seen many Soulslike games, and it has become a little difficult to emerge. What makes the game stand out?</strong></p>
<p>When we started working on the game, we wanted to leverage some of the features that make the Dungeon and Fighter series unique, such as fast-paced and intense combat and high challenge level. Ultimately, we brought these features into a 3D action game while also thinking about what kind of game players may enjoy. At the start of the adventure, it feels a bit like Dark Souls, with heavier combat and a high challenge level. But as the adventure proceeds, the main character becomes more powerful, finds new weapons, and unlocks new skills and abilities that change the experience into a more fast-paced one that's more in line with Dungeon and Fighter. In a way, it feels like the game's genre shifts midway, and this is what makes the game stand out the most.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned weapons. How many weapon types are in the game?</strong></p>
<p>The game features three weapon types - a dual-wielded sword and axe, a spear, and a greatsword. The number of total weapon types may feel small, but it actually isn't, as we consider the three weapons as three different characters. Each weapon comes with its set of skills, and by building Khazan with different gear, it's possible to empower different play styles for all weapons. The game also features gear sets in the vein of Diablo to provide further customization options. And if any of the choices the player has made, it is possible to fully respec Khazan and try out different things.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about items, is there a loot system?</strong></p>
<p>In The First Berserker: Khazan, players can farm certain items by defeating enemies repeatedly. However, the most valuable items are hidden away in the game's locations, so players will have to carefully look around to find them. This also makes exploration quite rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, games inspired by the Souls series started featuring different difficulty settings to allow less experienced players to enjoy them without getting frustrated by the high challenge level. Does The First Berserker: Khazan follow suit?</strong></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan features a single difficulty level, but we have used the game's content to address the difficulty issues, letting the player control the challenge level somewhat. If you want to experience a high challenge level, you can play the game normally. On the other hand, if you feel the action is too difficult, we have provided mechanics that can help the player, so by leveling up items or Khazan himself, battles will be more manageable. There's also a helper system designed to help players in the most difficult battles.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned a helper. Is it AI-controlled? Does the game feature any sort of multiplayer?</strong></p>
<p>The helper is AI-controlled, and there is no multiplayer at all.</p>
<p><strong>Any post-game content?</strong></p>
<p>More than post-game content, The First Berserker: Khazan features many reasons to play through the game again, such as multiple endings. In addition, the game features a lot of different builds that really change the way the game is played, so players can try them out and enjoy the game in a different light. Some of these builds cater to more experienced players, so they may be difficult to use during the first playthrough, but as the player's individual skills have increased, these may become viable.</p>
<p><strong>Is The First Berserker: Khazan getting additional content? Free or paid?</strong></p>
<p>We are working on additional content. We feel the base game will have enough content for its cost, so we want to provide content that will be worth the player's money. We will still have free updates, but the more meaningful additional content will come with paid content.</p>
<p><strong>Any PC-exclusive feature?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and the game will also support AMD FSR and Intel XeSS. No matter the platform, however, we are committed to delivering the best experience possible. That has been our priority from the start, and we are putting a lot of effort into optimizing the game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>

Details from Nintendo appear to have confirmed the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Once again, Nintendo has been secretive about the identity of its latest game's development team - even if the actual studio behind it isn't too much of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Fans had long expected Echoes of Wisdom, which shares a look and feel with the Nintendo Switch remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, to be made by the same studio. And indeed, this appears to be the case. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening on Switch was made by Grezzo, the Tokyo-based team that has collaborated with Nintendo on numerous Zelda handheld titles in the past, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-ocarina-time-3d">Ocarina of Time 3D</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-majoras-mask-3d">Majora's Mask 3D</a> for Nintendo 3DS, as well as the Switch port of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details seen by users who have pre-ordered Echoes of Wisdom show Nintendo and Grezzo mentioned in the game's trademarks.

Nintendo declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is currently also being secretive around the studio behind Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. The original studio behind the series, AlphaDream, closed down in 2019.
</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches next week - and after a chance to play it recently I came away thoroughly impressed. "Finally, this is Zelda's moment to shine," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reinvents-age-old-gameplay-as-the-series-finally-changes-its-star">Eurogamer's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's a pirates life for the Yakuza series. Earlier today, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The upcoming spin-off was announced during the RGG Summit livestream, and features recurring character Goro Majima swashing his buckles as the sole protagonist.</p>
<p>The game appears to take place after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, and sees poor ol' Goro washed up on the sandy shores of Rich Island, unsure of who he is or why he is there. Soon, however, he is embracing his inner-pirate to bombastic effect. I mean, why not! You can check out our first look at Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii in the video below.</p>

<p>As you can see, the combat in Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is very action based, with swords slashing and, of course, a good amount of rope swinging on board a pirate ship. Also, that water! Gosh, it looks divine. And a pirate hub! Yes, please do sign me up.</p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set to debut next year, on 28th February. It will launch across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4 and PC.</p>
<p>What do you think? Has Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii shivered your timbers, or do you think RGG needs to walk the plank?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
