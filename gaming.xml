            <p>
Behold, your irregular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> funding update is here, with the news Cloud Imperium Games' controversial space sim has now raised over $800m - despite there still being no hint of a version 1.0 release date some 12 years after its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen">original Kickstarter campaign</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Citizen's previous major milestone arrived last May, when <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals">Cloud Imperium's funding tracker</a> - which aggregates money raised from likes of paid alpha access and those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">eye-wateringly expensive ship packs</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">ticked over the $700m mark</a>. That does, of course, mean the game - as far as it can currently be described as such - has raised a staggering $100m in just 11 months.
</p>
<p>
All this and there's still no sign of a 1.0 release date for Star Citizen, although its paid public alpha continues to evolve with regular updates. The space sim, you might recall, was originally targeting a 2014 launch, but sailed right past that (and just kept going) as Cloud Imperium Games' plans grew ever-more ambitious and the project fell into a vortex of feature creep.

<p>
The closest Cloud Imperium has come to suggesting an end is in sight in recent times came last March when CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">wrote that the "team [was] hard at work, heads down, driving towards the finish line."</a> But while the massively multiplayer, persistent universe portion of Star Citizen is potentially still some significant way off, its story driven, single-player spin-off - known as Squadron 42 - is supposedly much closer on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Cloud Imperium last year said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-spin-off-squadron-42-will-release-in-2026-heres-an-hour-long-gameplay-teaser">targeting a 2026 launch for Squadron 42</a>, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-hires-hefty-hollywood-cast-for-squadron-42">star-studded cast</a> includes the likes of Gary Oldan, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, and Andy Serkis. But given the number of times the project has already slipped back (it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/11-years-later-star-citizen-dev-says-squadron-42-is-feature-complete">described as "feature complete" in 2023</a>), it remains to be seen whether that 2026 release window holds true.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Many expected Marvel Rivals to siphon off a number of players away from Overwatch. Thanks to the latest report from NewZoo on the state of the gaming industry, we now know many jumped ship, and what percentage of the overall market Marvel Rivals its hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-even-overwatch-classic-did-almost-nothing-to-stop-marvel-rivals">Even Overwatch Classic Did Almost Nothing to Stop Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>According to the latest<a href="https://resources.newzoo.com/hubfs/Free%20Reports/PC%20and%20Console%20Report/2025_Newzoo_The%20PC%20and%20Console%20Gaming%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=3440460-2025%20PC%20%26%20console&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kVtouoRdXai43NTW21yCjxlIAy1Rm3YMFWNGEsQ6J0AgoSoYZEdaa2ExtnJN1BX5v7OZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gaming industry report from NewZoo</a>, 45% of the Overwatch 2 players who stopped playing in December 2024 played Marvel Rivals instead. After hitting a very high peak in daily active users when it launched in early access in October 2022, Overwatch 2’s numbers dipped over the next year and a half. After stagnating throughout 2024, the game’s numbers got even lower in December when Marvel Rivals launched. The Overwatch: Classic Event temporarily increased player engagement by 12%, but this was followed by a 26% decline that coincided with the Marvel Rivals launch.</p>



<p>Despite releasing in the last month of 2024 though, Marvel Rivals was one of the most played games of the year. It had the eighth highest share of total playtime on Steam in 2024, and was the third highest among 2024 releases, behind Helldivers 2 and Palworld. Amongst all the most played free-to-play 2024 releases on Steam, PS5, and Xbox, Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the only game</a> that has not shut down or is more than 90% below its peak monthly average users (MAU).</p>



<p>Free-to-play game playtime reportedly grew in 2024, and Marvel Rivals was also a major part of that. Marvel Rivals was the second highest source of growth in free-to-play game playtime (amongst new releases) in 2024, just behind The First Descendant. It’s worth noting though that The First Descendant released several months before Marvel Rivals did, and according to current Steam player numbers, Marvel Rivals currently is drastically outpacing it.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ numbers on Steam have been slowly declining since launch, but a surge could occur <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-all-changes-and-updates-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in just a matter of days when Season 2 starts</a>. Will it finish 2025 as one of the most played games of the year?

<p>If you want to play Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle immediately after it finally launches on PlayStation 5, our preload and file size guide has you covered. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launched in December 2024 as an Xbox Series X/S and Windows exclusive. The game received glowing reviews, leading to reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Indiana Jones games</a> are in development. </p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft boldly decided to remove console exclusivity and release the game on PlayStation 5. This follows a trend of other titles making the leap, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PlayStation this spring, and rumors suggest that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Halo</a> could also be coming. For all the PlayStation users who initially missed out on Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle, this guide is for you. </p>

<p><strong>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1909573383991275871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, the PlayStation File Size for Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle is 125.290 gigabytes</strong>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/american-tabletop-awards-2025-winners-announced-showcasing-industry-variety<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The official awards committee of the American Tabletop Awards 2025 announced their winners. These awards are essentially the US' answer to the prestigious Spiel des Jahres, are intended to represent a wide variety of excellent board games across multiple genres and themes.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://americantabletopawards.com/2025-american-tabletop-award-winners/" rel="nofollow">website post</a>, the committee announced the American Tabletop Awards 2025 winners. As always, the winners span four different categories and are decided upon by a committee of US-based board game pundits, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA</a> president Nicole Brady.</p>

<p>The Early Gamers award is for shorter board games aimed at younger players (roughly 12 and under) and tabletop newcomers. The Casual Games award is for games aimed at general audiences of all ages. The Strategy Games award are a step above casual games, requiring a bit more forethought and consideration. Finally, the Complex Games award are games aimed at experienced players.</p>

In simple terms, the game has you assembling a pirate crew on a ship from a bag of tiles at random. Don't like a certain tile you got? Flip it. It's simple, it's cooperative, and it has an appealing art style.</p>

This is a cooperative poker game created by John Cooper and Kory Heath and published by Thames and Kosmos. In a gameplay system similar to the indie videogame craze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Balatro</em></a>, players work together to pull off heists, represented by the strength of different poker hands.</p>

To Japan</em>, designed by Josh Wood and published by AEG. Flavorwise, the game is about planning the perfect trip to Japan. Players get thirteen rounds split between Kyoto and Tokyo. Once it is planned, players undergo the trip, earning points based on their activities.</p>

<p>It's essentially a modern take on <em>Tokaido</em>, another tabletop experience about traveling through Japan. The committee recognized Let's Go! To Japan thanks to its blend of approachability and challenge.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/american-tabletop-awards-2025-fromage-featured-image.jpg?itok=J_QMIeS5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/american-tabletop-awards-2025-fromage-featured-image.jpg?itok=eXVlfhcu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, the American Tabletop Awards 2025 Complex Games winner was <em>Fromage</em>. This board game was designed by Matthew O' Malley and Ben Rosset and was published by Road to Infamy Games. As the name implies, the game is all about becoming the best cheesemaker in the world. It is a complex blend of worker placement and time management courtesy of a rotating game board.</p>

<p>Plus, as the committee remarks, it gives you an excuse to make constant cheese jokes.</p>

But some of that rebalancing ended up leaking out into the full campaign, and overall many players felt the changes made the game’s <em>Souls</em>-inspired combat meat grinder feel way overtuned and unrewarding. Negative user reviews instantly started pouring in on Steam and pushed <em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s rating down into mixed territory. </p><p>“Every boss fight is incredibly longer than it needs to be. Most of the skills do little to no damage,” wrote one player reviewing the game on Steam. “I understand they said they wanted to slow game play down, but I don’t think I will even make it more than 1 week in this league at this point.” Another asked, “how do you have a relatively good first patch then wait 3 months nerf everything and make the campaign a worse experience?” Some fans on the game’s subreddit were similarly apoplectic.<strong> </strong>“I was going to take a day or two off work to play this game,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “But I removed my vacation I had put in. I’d rather just go into work than play this game right now.”</p><p>Grinding Gear rushed into action with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of quick patches</a></span> to try and ameliorate the key pain points, including the new Huntress class being so reliant on a parry mechanic to be effective, as well as more basic complaints around crashes and server disconnects. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A long list of balance changes</a></span> was outlined earlier today to go live across the rest of the week, including making a range of character skills more powerful. “Now that we have a lot of the nerfs out of the way, we can concentrate on buffing things that are not performing well,” the developers wrote. </p><p>In some ways, that sounds like Early Access working exactly as intended, though there are perhaps deeper philosophical issues underlying some of the ongoing community angst around each big new<em> Path of Exile 2 </em>update. Some of that has to do with a clear, overall effort to make a game that’s (somewhat) more approachable to get into than its predecessor, but also decisively more punishing.  Some of it has to do with the fact that people who still love and play the original<em> Path of Exile</em> feel left behind. That game’s next big season was delayed as Grinding Gear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502">tries to get a handle on the sequel</a></span>. </p><p>“I think a running theme with <em>PoE 2</em> in general is that the target to hit is smaller because if we want the combat to be more engaging, then that means there’s a smaller target; it puts more pressure on the balance to be right,” Rogers said during yesterday’s livestream. Some fans were critical of him for appearing “defensive” early on during the interview. He apologized toward the end of the chat and said he had just gotten up on the wrong side of the bed. Roberts added that he actually thought it was one of the duo’s more productive discussions about the game because they came out of it ready to launch over a dozen changes to get <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>back on track. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most widely appreciated games of 2025. It’s a phenomenal medieval RPG with a winding, adventurous story, and it’s packed to the brim with top-tier talent and wonderful, cinematic sequences. That’s what I alluded to in my full review for the game, at least.</p>



<p>I recently had the chance to catch up (again) with Tom McKay at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. We spent a few minutes talking about the success of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is one of the best-selling games of 2025 and will <strong>surely </strong>be up for many awards as the year unravels.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<h2 id="h-huge-expectations">‘Huge Expectations’</h2>



<p>I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> about Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is something I’ll never stop boasting about. I hold the series very close to my heart, having poured hundreds of hours into both games and connecting eternally with the characters, particularly McKay’s Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p>When I chatted with Tom at the BAFTA Games Awards, I was eager to gauge just how much this game had defied their expectations:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had huge expectations based on the first game, a ton of effort went into the development of the second game, and they took their time – they put everything they had into it.</p>



<p>They were certainly proud of the product and knew that what they had was a good thing, but you can never predict how people will see that. Ultimately, it’s the players who are the most important reviewers of all.</p>



<p>The kind of energy and support and positivity that we’ve had from the fans has been incredible, and I don’t think any of us anticipated that, I certainly didn’t.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fan base for Kingdom Come has exploded in recent months. It helps that the cast and crew have been immensely supportive of what they’ve produced. The actor behind the iconic Hans Capon, Luke Dale, has taken to streaming the game and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/">become an overnight sensation</a>, racking up thousands of viewers.</p>



<p>I asked McKay how things had changed since we caught up just after KCD2 was announced to the world.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels amazing – it’s <strong>like a sort of fever dream</strong>, really.</p>



<p>I think back to the very beginning of the first game, when I flew out the Prague and had what was essentially a final audition and I met the core creative team for the first time. That just feels like a world away, you know? </p>



<p>It is like a fever dream that we’re actually having this conversation about this game. However, in terms of what they’ve achieved and what they’ve made, Warhorse Studios, that doesn’t feel like a fever dream, because they’re so talented and so passionate, so on that level, it feels totally fitting. </p>



<p>In terms of that, I salute all of them. The reason I’m standing here is because of the work they’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">one hell of a roadmap ahead</a>, with three planned expansions yet to drop this year. Warhorse Studios is also releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode/">Hardcore Mode next week</a>, complete with a new lineup of perks.</p>

<p>In my review for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I noted that most of the game’s wildlife is pretty pointless. All across the world, animals roam free with no real purpose or control, and you can’t <strong>hunt them</strong> like you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>One thing I can’t complain about in the animal stakes is the sheer volume of cute kittens, puppy dogs, baby deer, and other adorable creatures scampering around Feudal Japan. I’ve just learned that (at least) one of those cuddly pets is based on a real cat that belongs to a Ubisoft developer.</p>

<h2 id="h-perks-of-the-job">Perks of the Job</h2>



<p>When you work as a Production Manager on a game, one thing you’ll surely be able to do is immortalise your feline friend for all to see.</p>



<p>That’s what Nik Pantis did while working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Pantis revealed that his stark white kitty, Ghost, is immortalised in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as ‘Bakeneko,’ a one-of-a-kind supernatural yōkai or kaibyō – a <em>ghost cat</em>. </p>



<p>He shared an image of Ghost both in the real world and as the Bakeneko in Assassin’s Creed:</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time a legendary cat has found its way into an Assassin’s Creed game. In 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, a special cat belonging to a fan of the game surfaced – with a very interesting feature. The cat had a natural representation of the Assassin’s Creed logo across its face.</p>



<p>Sadly, the cat passed away before the game was released, but Ubisoft pulled some strings to immortalise a treasured companion.</p>



<p>I’m off to find me a Bakeneko.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>

		<p>Disney Illusion Island will no longer be a Nintendo Switch exclusive, as today it has been announced that the platformer will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th. There will be a physical version released for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with that launching on May 30th in North America and in Europe on June 27th, with pre-orders live now.</p>

<p>When Disney Illusion Island releases for all of these platforms, new free content will be added in the form of Cave Adventuring Scavenger Hunt, which will allow players to unlock permanent upgrades. Disney Illusion Island will support four player co-op allowing the whole cast of characters to be playable at the same time, where players will swim, jump, and run through the different levels. Of course, you can also play the game solo too and you can choose who to play as with those options being Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.</p>
<p>The setting of Disney Illusion Island is the mysterious island of Monoth, which is split into three different biomes. Those areas are the leafy and overgrown Pavonia, the puzzling structures of Gizmopolis and the space styled oceans of Astrono. . All of the cutscenes are fully voiced and brand new characters will be introduced through the game.</p>

Why “boomer”? Well because the people who were playing stuff like <em>Doom </em>and <em>Quake </em>back in the day were likely boomers. So while the games aren’t that old, the name has stuck as a way of lumping a bunch of retro-inspired FPS titles together. As usual, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">video game genres are weird and messy</a></span>!</p><p>Anyway, over the last few years we’ve seen a huge increase in the number of boomer shooters released. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bing-badda-boom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bing-badda-boom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And now Humble Bundle has created a new bundle containing seven boomer shooters for the low price of $16</a></span>. </p><p>Here are the game included in the bundle:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em><strong>Forgive Me Father 2 </strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Turbo Overkill</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>W40k: Necromunda: Hired Gun</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Graven</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Deadlink</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Powerslave: Exhumed</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Serious Sam: Siberian Mayhem</strong></em></li></ul><p> The codes included in the bundle are for the Steam versions of these games on PC.

Oh, and don’t ignore <em>Powerslave: Exhumed,</em> an odd duck of a game that is a remaster of the PlayStation port of 90s DOS game <em>Powerslave</em>.

			<p>Players subscribed to the lowest, or 'Essential' tier of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory-join-playstation-plus-april-lineup/">PlayStation Plus</a> can already grab the three free games for April 2025. Beginning on April 15, 2025, players subscribed to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers can collect their additional free games for the month.</p>
<p>As announced in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>, six games are being added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers, and two classic titles, one from the original PlayStation and the other from the PS2, are being added to the PS Plus Premium classic games catalog.</p>
<p>The six games added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers and above include the 2023 commercial hit Hogwarts Legacy, a brand new puzzle game called Blue Prince, which is launching onto the service tomorrow, April 10. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, EA Sports PGA Tour, Battlefield 1, and Plate Up!.</p>
<p>The two classic titles are Alone in the Dark 2 from the original PlayStation and War of the Monsters from the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Of all eight games in this lineup, Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most high-profile title, but arguably, the most prominent inclusion is the soon-to-release Blue Prince. Reviews for the new puzzle game from developer Dogubomb and publisher Raw Fury went live earlier this week, and so far, it has the highest score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">Metacritic</a> for any game released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's being touted as a new masterpiece, so if you like puzzle games and have a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription, it might be worth checking out. Xbox players aren't being left out either since it'll also be available in Xbox Game Pass when it launches tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Is there going to be a third The Last of Us game? Given the big success of the first two games and the HBO series, many are expecting more entries in the game series. But Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann says it would take something special for the studio to make a third game.</p><p>He told <a href="https://x.com/NaughtyNDC/status/1909971408546914368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a> that he's currently focused on the TV show--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">which was just renewed for a third season</a>--along with the game he's directing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. He's not ruling out a third The Last of Us game, but he's not confirming it either.</p><p>"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p>Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p>"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-clarifies-comments-on-the-last-of-us-3/1100-6530414/" data-ref-id="1100-6530414">repeating himself here</a>, as he previously addressed rumors of The Last of Us: Part III by saying he treats every game like his last and that the stars would have to align for it to come about.</p><p>In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Reporter Daniel Richtman said <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part III is in production now.</a> For what it's worth, Druckmann has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">he has a story in mind for The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon. As for The Last of Us TV series, Season 2 premieres this Sunday, April 13.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A small update has arrived to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is an adjustment for Call of Duty's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The Terminator T-800 operator's Endo Titanium Core skin is nerfed in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This specific operator skin can be very difficult to see in dark corners of the maps, and according to the patch notes, the skin received a "visibility adjustment to ease target identification."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1909721974395519000" rel="nofollow ">post from CharlieIntel</a> shows a side-by-side comparison of the skin before and after the visual update, which players are already commenting on to express that the change wasn't drastic enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes one of Call of Duty's new Ricochet security features for account linking. Now, any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time. Accounts that fail to complete this step will be locked from use on the PC platform until the security check is completed. This is all part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-duty-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-fight-cheaters/1100-6530471/">Call of Duty's new anti-cheat efforts</a>, as previously detailed by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side of the update, there are several fixes for bugs on the new Shattered Veil map. This includes the white-screen bug that prevented some players from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">main story quest for Shattered Veil</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, the update makes changes to the game's ground loot. The DM-10 marksman rifle, Tsarkov marksman rifle, and the SVD sniper rifle are removed from supply boxes and ground loot.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h2>GLOBAL</h2><h3>Ricochet Anti-Cheat</h3><p>We’ve rolled out changes to account linking as described <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">in a blog from #TeamRicochet</a> ahead of Season 03.</p><p>These changes will provide additional security to players with multiple platforms linked to their ATVI ID.</p><p>Account Linking Update</p><ul><li>Any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time.</li><li>Not completing this verification check will lock the account from use on the PC platform only until completed.</li><li>Read more <a href="http://callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">about this policy change here</a>, and visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/keeping-your-activision-account-secure" rel="nofollow ">Keeping your Activision Account Secure</a> periodically for account security best practices.</li></ul><p>From the Ricochet Blog on 3/28:</p><p>Account Linking Changes</p><p>In a proactive effort to protect our players, we’re adjusting account linking shortly after the launch of Season 03. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform. Players will see an in-game notification if this occurs, locking gameplay on the new platform until the authentication has been completed.</p><p>If you receive an email notification about a platform link or login attempt you did not initiate, visit CallofDuty.com to login and immediately unlink the account and update your password.</p><p>Securing your account by enabling 2FA is important, as is making sure you are not reusing passwords for your Activision ID that you would for other apps or websites. Reusing passwords on other apps or websites in connection with your email can open the door to your account being stolen or hijacked.

                <p>Despite The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker being one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/" data-ref-id="1100-6530559">GameCube games appearing on Nintendo Switch Online</a> when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> drops, that doesn't mean the Wii U version won't be ported to the Switch platform.</p><p>Kinda Funny Games asked Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff if having Wind Waker on Nintendo Switch Online precluded the Switch 2 getting the updated Wii U port at a later date. "[Bihldorff] was very quick to say 'no,' like, all options are on the table," said Kinda Funny host Tim Gettys. "Obviously, nothing's confirmed one way or another, but there are many examples of games that are on NSO and can still get them in a different way."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1tV6XowUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the list of examples is small, some include the Blaster Master and Wild Guns. Several NES and Game Boy Blaster Master games are available on NSO. However, the series was rebooted with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blaster-master-zero/" data-ref-id="5000-459308">Blaster Master Zero</a> and is available on Switch. The SNES version of Wild Guns is available on NSO, and the game received an enhanced remaster called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-guns-reloaded/" data-ref-id="5000-454656">Wild Guns Reloaded</a>, which is also available on Switch.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-review/1900-6414506/" data-ref-id="1900-6414506">Wii U version</a> has a bevy of new features and quality-of-life improvements that make it a much smoother experience. However, there will also be improvements to the GameCube version when it lands on Switch 2. Games can receive a resolution boost and faster loading times, as well as online multiplayer functionality.</p><p>There were rumors of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-and-wind-waker-switch-release-rumored-for-2022/1100-6503137/" data-ref-id="1100-6503137">Wind Waker and Twilight Princess</a> being ported to the first Switch several years ago, but those never came to fruition. However, it seems like that still might be possible with Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
