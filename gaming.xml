            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-14-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.4 release date, and the update will bring major overhauls to some of the game's systems, as well as new characters and more, later this month.</p>

<p>Version 1.4, also known as "A Storm of Falling Stars", will officially arrive across all platforms on December 18th. Its biggest new feature is an overhaul to the way Main Story stages work; the story's TV mode will be "replaced with story stages", allowing you to jump straight into battles.</p>

<p>You can expect redesigned versions of Main Story stages from the Prologue through Chapter 3, and future story chapters will also work on this new system. You can also now play as all contracted Agents in the city, as well as walking through New Eridu with your Agents in the new Quality Time Mode.</p>

<p>Your first new character is the Frost Anomaly Agent Hoshimi Miyabi, who can deal huge damage with "swift movements and precise slashes". She's joined by Electric Agent Asaba Harumasa, who wields both a bow and a blade.</p>

<p>New combat modes will also be introduced in this update, including a major Hollow Zero update and the new Deadly Assault periodic operation. If you feel like testing your strategy skills, you can also check out the new Bangboo tower defense game in the Reverb Arena.</p>




<p>Version 1.4 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>will also bring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">PS5 Pro enhancements</a> for the game, including "enhanced performance and ray-tracing technology" to make HoYoverse's latest action RPG look and feel even snazzier.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.4 launches on December 18th. The game is available to play right now for free on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.</p>

But if you do decide to jump in and take a look around <em>The Storybook Vale</em> expansion, you might feel slightly overwhelmed by just how much more there is to uncover in this one expansion alone. And if you’ve scrolled through your collection, you’ve probably seen Sea Monster Tooth, which may leave you wondering how to get this interesting new crafting item. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It turns out that Sea Monster Tooth is a somewhat frustrating item to obtain.

You can speed things up a bit, though, by bringing along a fishing friend who will ensure that you earn an extra Sea Monster Tooth each time you fish one up.</p><figure id="" data-id="6d59a3cc9a11c078c99a041b621b2673" data-recommend-id="image://6d59a3cc9a11c078c99a041b621b2673" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player catches a Sea Monster Tooth in Disney Dreamlight Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player catches a Sea Monster Tooth in Disney Dreamlight Valley." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d59a3cc9a11c078c99a041b621b2673" data-recommend-id="image://6d59a3cc9a11c078c99a041b621b2673" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player catches a Sea Monster Tooth in Disney Dreamlight Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since pools begin to disappear for a while after you’ve exhausted all of their spawn points in an area, you may want to head to other locations within the Everafter.

You can then go north again into The Beanstalk Marshes to fish before finally going down into Teapot Falls. </p><p>After exhausting all of the pools in each of these locations, you should be able to go from Teapot Falls back into The Wild Woods to find that some pools are replenishing, allowing you to begin the process back over.</p><p>Getting a stack of Sea Monster Tooth may take a while, but it’s necessary for crafting some of the coolest items from <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, so keep at it!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has not been spared from the discourse about “dying” that surrounds multiplayer and live service games in recent years. Counter-Strike as a series has been around for decades, and the state of the game has been a constant discussion point since.</p>



<p>But is there any truth to the arguments that CS2 is dying?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-players-saying-that-cs2-is-dying">Why are players saying that CS2 is dying?</h2>



<p>There are a number of issues that the wider Counter-Strikes 2 player base has with the state of the game.</p>



<p>One of these issues has been Valve Anti-Cheat, the anti-cheat program that’s supposed to keep cheaters and hackers at bay. Many players claim that VAC hardly keeps cheaters out, and that they are constantly running into cheaters on a frequent basis.</p>



<p>Other issues plaguing the game include client performance, a lack of new content (seasonal operations), more frequent crashes, subtick issues, and various bugs.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-2-dying">Is Counter-Strike 2 dying?</h2>



<p>Despite the issues facing Counter-Strike 2 currently, the game is not dying. While the player numbers for CS2 have always fluctuated, there’s been no consistent dropoff. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak player and average player numbers</a> as of December 2024 are lower now than they were in April or May, but higher than they were in January or February.</p>



<figure><figcaption>CS2 player peaks and averages, per SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These numbers will typically spike after a large update, whether that be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change to the map pool</a> or a return of the Major pass. While these larger updates feel more sparse when compared to other popular multiplayer titles, players are still logging back in to play. Valve is also still (slowly) releasing updates regarding some of the major issues.</p>



<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam at any given time, and likely will remain that way for a long time.</p>



<p>Thoughts on CS2 as whole? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> is arguably the most legendary franchise in gaming, proving time and again why it’s so overwhelmingly popular. It has produced some of the most instantly recognisable protagonists in the business – and even the franchise’s side characters are just as memorable. With Grand Theft Auto 6 on the horizon, we thought it’d be appropriate to rank the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/">Grand Theft Auto</a> protagonists, figuring out once and for all which main character in the GTA series is the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-protagonists-ranked">Grand Theft Auto Protagonists Ranked</h2>



<p><em>It’s driven mostly by opinion – if you have your own ranking for the Grand Theft Auto characters, feel free to drop a comment saying who you’d put where in this list!</em></p>



<h4 id="h-10-victor-vance-vice-city-stories">10. Victor Vance (Vice City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vic Vance first appeared as a minor character in Vice City and had his own journey documented later on in Vice City Stories, which was a prequel of sorts. He becomes embroiled in the seedy, criminal underbelly of Vice City to support his family, and while his game boasted a good story, it wasn’t overwhelmingly impactful – hence the rating.</p>



<h4 id="h-9-johnny-klebitz-the-lost-and-damned">9. Johnny Klebitz (The Lost and Damned)</h4>



<p>Back when Grand Theft Auto actually had story-based expansions, players were introduced to Johnny Klebitz. As a part of the Grand Theft Auto IV saga, Johnny took centre stage in The Lost and Damned, a gritty expansion based around an outlaw motorcycle club that was strewn with themes of brotherhood, loyalty, and the constant threat of brutal death. </p>

<h4 id="h-8-tommy-vercetti-vice-city">8. Tommy Vercetti (Vice City)</h4>



<p>Tommy Vercetti is an iconic PlayStation 2-era character, emerging from the very heart of Vice City as one the most ruthless and headstrong characters in the GTA series. As a former hitman for the Mafia, Vercetti has the tools needed to survive in the trade, and there are hopes he’ll resurface in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h4 id="h-7-claude-gta-iii">7. Claude (GTA III)</h4>



<figure><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gta-5/"></a></figure>







<p>Claude was a silent protagonist who ushered in a new generation of gaming with the introduction of Grand Theft Auto III, the first 3D game in the series. It changed the paradigm for open-world adventures, and despite Claude never uttering a word, he’d become known as one of the most impactful Grand Theft Auto protagonists ever.</p>



<h4 id="h-6-franklin-clinton-gta-v">6. Franklin Clinton (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Franklin Clinton was always more of a follower than a leader – first with Lemar Davis and then with Michael De Santa – but he had remarkable talents that made him shine in Grand Theft Auto V. His struggles ultimately turned themselves around, and in a relatively short period of time, Franklin Clinton became a legend of the streets, making millions, living in Vinewood Hills, and pulling off immense heists.</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-gta-5-still-so-popular/">Why Is GTA 5 Still So Popular?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-5-trevor-philips-gta-v">5. Trevor Philips (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Trevor Philips was as unhinged as they came, but he was one of the most entertaining Grand Theft Auto protagonists to ever grace our screens. His anger management issues made for some hilarious situations, and despite his insanely hot head, he was an overwhelmingly talented marksman with a cold and calculating mind for business, and that’s what made him such a strong GTA protagonist.</p>



<h4 id="h-4-tony-cipriani-liberty-city-stories">4. Tony Cipriani (Liberty City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tony Cipriani is one of the few GTA characters to bridge that gap between more than one game, appearing in both Grand Theft Auto III as a main character and in Liberty City Stories as the protagonist. He was a driving force in the Leone Crime Family that was based in Liberty City, and as both a fiercely loyal individual and a talented combatant, he made his mark on the franchise and proved that someone can perfect the balance between being a <strong>family man </strong>and a <strong>made man</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="h-3-michael-de-santa-gta-v">3. Michael De Santa (GTA V)</h4>



<p>In many ways, Michael De Santa was the driving force behind the Grand Theft Auto V story – he was the catalyst and the spark that triggered events and snowballed them into the grand adventure that hundreds of millions of players have enjoyed. He’s a skilled criminal, even in his later years, and he’s unbelievably talented with any form of weaponry. He’s also a master thief, a charismatic individual, and what’s more, he recognises the need to help youngsters develop themselves into something greater than what they are. </p>

<h4 id="h-2-carl-cj-johnson-san-andreas">2. Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson (San Andreas)</h4>



<p>Carl Johnson was introduced to the world in 2004’s GTA San Andreas, and he would ultimately go on to become one of the most iconic Grand Theft Auto protagonists of all time. He’s a die-hard family man and a ruthless fighter with a heart of gold, and he wants what’s best for those closest to him. He’s multi-talented, oozes charisma, and his journey across San Andreas turns him from a back-street gangbanger to a legendary icon of the series.</p>



<h4 id="h-1-niko-bellic-gta-iv">1. Niko Bellic (GTA IV)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) players were introduced to a darker, more serious tone – and it was a total break away from what we’d come to know and love from the series thus far. However, it was a smash hit, and it put Niko Bellic on the GTA map. </p>



<p>As the man who sits atop the list of the best Grand Theft Auto protagonists, Niko has earned his spot for many reasons. Firstly, he’s a stalwart protector of his family and friends, which makes him honourable. He does what he does with the best of intentions in mind, and somehow, he manages to be likeable even when he’s going on a rampage to protect those he loves.</p>



<p>He’s a mysterious, storied character with a background that players simply desire to learn more about, and his journey through Liberty City is monumental. He goes from being an immigrant fresh off the deck of a cargo boat to being a respected, revered criminal presence in the city. </p>



<p>That’s why he’s the best Grand Theft Auto protagonist in the series.</p>

                <p>The newest Call of Duty weapons have been revealed online, and we are running out of ways to describe how ridiculous and over-the-top the game's guns have become. As announced previously, Black Ops 6 and Warzone are getting numerous new weapons in Season 1 Reloaded, and these include a gun that turns into a bong and a melee weapon that morphs into a rave with a cat as the DJ. Seriously.</p><p>Call of Duty has, for many years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">enjoyed and embraced pot-smoking</a>, and the new Dank Days skin bundle that turns you into a pot-smoking lizard continues that trend. The gun even lets you spark up and use your gun as a bong, as smoke clouds emerge. The "Toxic Pawsitivity Mastercraft," meanwhile, transforms the baseball bat melee weapon into a rave, with a little cat acting as the DJ. Check out the videos below to see these in action, and expect these store bundles to come to Black Ops 6 and Warzone soon.</p><p>These videos emerged from data-miners. When a new Call of Duty season launches, like Season 1 Reloaded did on December 5, people quickly dig through the files to find what's coming next, and that includes these two wacky bundles.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded brings a lot more to Call of Duty than bongs and raves. The update introduces new maps, modes, weapons, events, and all manner of holiday season changes.</p><p>For more on what's coming to Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 1 Reloaded this December, check out the gallery below.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As part of its commitment to making gaming as accessible to as many people as possible, EA has pledged 23 new patents to share across the industry via its accessibility portal.</p>
<p>The new patents include tools to help developers run real-time testing for photosensitivity, as well as improvements in speech and audio generation and recognition.</p>

<p>Included amongst the patents is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that uses EA's photosensitivity analysis tech, IRIS, to "analyse and identify, in real-time as they're running their games, frames that could potentially impact players who experience photosensitivity".</p>
<p>Among the patents added this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligent Personalised Speech Recognition</strong>: Speech recognition system that improves the accuracy and efficiency of speech recognition by using personal phoneme mappings for each user, to better understand accent and other pronunciation variations such as those resulting from speech impairments.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Expressive Speech Audio From Text Data</strong>: A system that generates expressive speech audio from text data, and provides more control and personalization of the generated speech based on desired speaking style and speaker attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Speech in the Voice of a Player of a Video Game</strong>: A system that can generate speech in the voice of a player, for their avatar, based on minimal sample speech data as compared with existing techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Aging Using Machine Learning</strong>: A system that can age an original input voice to a desired target age without requiring additional voice samples.</li>
<li><strong>Emotion Based Music Style Change Using Deep Learning</strong>: A system that infers a player's emotion while playing a video game and tunes the background soundtrack of the game to best fit that emotion.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically Selecting Speech Functionality on Client Devices</strong>: A system that automatically detects and enables speech recognition technologies available on a gaming device.</li>

<p>"We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality," said Kerry Hopkins, SVP of global affairs at EA.</p>
<p>"By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-makes-four-more-patents-open-source-in-a-bid-to-share-its-accessibility-tools-and-help-gamers">These latest patents come after EA "opened up" its accessibility tools</a> and technology for "wider use to help gamers" in 2021. Included in the first accessibility patent pledge was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>' celebrated "ping" system.</p>
<p>In a statement at the time, EA reiterated its commitment to inclusivity by making its accessibility tools available publicly via open source.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1562831&amp;action=edit" aria-label="“Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Marvel Rivals, Path of Exile 2 NVIDIA Game Ready Driver Now Available For Download” (Edit)">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is an impressive ray tracing showcase on Xbox Series X and even Xbox Series S, according to a new in-depth analysis shared online today.</p>
<p>In their tech review of the action-adventure title developed by MachineGames, which is now available in early access for those who purchase one of the game's special editions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the game is an impressive ray tracing showcase on both Microsoft's current-generation consoles, thanks to its main visual feature, ray-traced diffuse global illumination. This is used to calculate indirect lighting from light sources like the sun, making the lighting in pretty much every scene feel incredibly natural. In a couple of scenes shown in the video below, RTGI makes scenes with light pouring from outside look incredible, with no light bleed or gaps in the lighting. Even more impressive is how clean it looks, although there are some light image quality stability issues when moving the camera around quickly, and the fact that, on Xbox Series X, the game averages 1800p resolution and successfully targets 60 FPS gameplay. Building the lighting system of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using ray tracing was also an excellent choice for the game's setting, as Indy explores a lot of locations that have natural lighting, enhancing the experience considerably while making the whole game a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>MachineGames also managed to get the game running decently on Xbox Series S with RTGI. Unsurprisingly, some compromises had to be made, such as lowering the resolution to 1080p and below, but generally, experiencing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the system is perfectly viable, even with some image quality issues caused by a disappointing implementation of Variable Rate Shading, lower texture quality and more.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an impressive game not only for its gorgeous visuals but also for its gameplay and story, which is one of the best Indiana Jones stories ever made.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has warned that the game may run into server issues during its Early Access launch period owing to the sheer volume of players who've redeemed keys.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Grinding Gear technical director Jonathan Rogers says that a million&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access keys have been redeemed, which counts both sales of the game and those who've received a free key for spending a certain amount on the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>.</p>

<p>Rogers says that the sheer volume of redemptions means there are "probably going to be some queues" over the weekend, and that Grinding Gear "really didn't expect" a million players to log in at the same time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-server-issues-early-access-warning-combat.jpg?itok=DmR86Dzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-server-issues-early-access-warning-combat.jpg?itok=RlqKL3e3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grinding Gear Games has warned that&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>may experience some server issues over the weekend.</figcaption></figure><p>In a refreshing display of honesty, Rogers says he does "have some concerns about issues with the backend" of&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, even though Grinding Gear has ordered more cloud capacity, with those servers coming online "very soon".</p>

<p>Rogers goes on to say that he and Grinding Gear "quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle" with regards to player numbers, and that while everything's been scaled up as far as it will go, it's not clear what "limits" could be hit during the first weekend.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Rogers says that if&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>does hit server issues over the course of the launch weekend, then the dev team will work as hard as it can to solve those issues, so if you do hit queues, be patient; fixes will be on the way.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It packs in a brand new campaign, hundreds of new monsters, and plenty of loot to gather, plus new skills to discover and more.</p>

<p>The game launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">later today</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

"We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next-generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?' And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top-down game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Grand Theft Auto Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result of this deal, Grand Theft Auto 3 released in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive, a month before the original Xbox came out. The game released in May 2002 on PC, and then, two years after the PlayStation launch and after this exclusivity deal ended, in November 2003 for the Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Deering mentioned, Sony’s Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal was for three games, so included Vice City, which came out in October 2002 for the PS2 first, and San Andreas, which released in October 2004 for the PS2 first. Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City hit Xbox together as a pack late 2003, with San Andreas launching in June 2005.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal worked out perfectly for both Sony and Rockstar parent company Take-Two, as Deering suggests. Indeed, San Andreas ended up the best-selling PS2 game of all time, Vice City the third best, and Grand Theft Auto 3 the fifth best. Only Gran Turismo came close the the sales the Grand Theft Auto games posted on PS2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The exclusivity deal also helped cement Grand Theft Auto as a PlayStation-first series, and while Grand Theft Auto 4 and Grand Theft Auto 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time, Rockstar’s open-world crime epic is still strongly associated with Sony’s consoles, even now. In fact, a number of Grand Theft Auto games made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-playstation-games-of-all-time">IGN’s Top 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time list</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>? It’s due out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S at the same time in the fall of 2025, but marketing deals with either Sony or Microsoft have yet to be announced, if they exist at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The highly anticipated Section 6 Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa, are coming soon, unveiling the culminating chapter of the year. The update will also introduce a major new combat gameplay mode, Hollow Zero: Shadows Lost, alongside the addition of new areas, Port Elpis and <a title="Games > Reverb" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reverb">Reverb</a> Arena.

Redesigned Main Story stages from the Prologue to Chapter 3 are now added to the HDD system. In future updates to the Main Story, the TV mode will also be replaced with story stages, allowing Proxies to dive directly into battles while commanding Eous to explore the Hollows. Additionally, all contracted Agents will be playable in the city, and a new Quality Time Mode lets Proxies stroll through New Eridu with their Agents. In combat, Decibels will no longer be shared across the squad, allowing all squad members to unleash their stunning Ultimates in a row for even more spectacular battle scenes. The update also adds a Quick Sweep feature for Shiyu Defense challenges, along with other optimizations to streamline progression and character upgrades.</p><p>In previous chapters, Proxies were drawn into a conspiracy surrounding Sacrifice after the demolition case orchestrated by Vision Corporation.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas launched as PlayStation 2 exclusives back in the day, and the deal to bring these games exclusively to the console was signed partially because Sony was worried about Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking during an EGX London special session hosted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/christopher-dring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring</a>, Chris Deering, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president up until the release of the PlayStation 3, commented on the many deals that made several third-party games PlayStation exclusives, saying that some of them, such as the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, were signed partially as a reaction to Xbox. The company was worried when they saw the console coming, and they knew exclusivity was a big deal in other fields, so, as the first Xbox launch was approaching, they spoke with some of their favorite third-party developers and publishers, asking them if they would have liked to sign a special deal to keep their next-generation games PlayStation exclusives for two years. Take-Two was among the publishers that accepted the offer, which paid off in a very big way against expectations, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grand Theft Auto</a> wasn't as big as it is nowadays, with its first top-down entries not having exactly set the world on fire.</p>
<p>Besides commenting on the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, other former Sony executives commented on other interesting facts about PlayStation's 30-year history, such as trade media skepticism of the PlayStation 2, the well-known PlayStation 3 development issues, London Studio complaining about the lack of a built-in camera for the PlayStation 4, and more.

<p>Lots of enjoyment is to be had on PlayStation 5. Whether your kids beg for something new to play or could use a fun distraction, there’s no going wrong with the games on this list. There are also a few notable, kid-friendly PlayStation exclusives not to be missed. In no particular order, we’re compiling some of the best PlayStation 5 Games for children.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-ps5-games-for-kids">Top PS5 Games for Kids</h2>



<p>Look no further than this list for the best breakdown possible:</p>



<h2 id="h-1-astro-bot">1. Astro Bot</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Astro Bot is one of the highest-rated PlayStation 5 games of 2024 and probably the <strong>best </strong>game for kids on PS5. It features a wealth of worlds to explore, puzzles to solve, and obstacle courses to overcome. If you’re a PlayStation fan of any kind, you’ll adore digging through Astro Bot to find all the cameos and ‘guest appearances’, and there’s plenty of meat on these bones to keep children entertained for hours on end.</p>



<p>It’s a follow-on from Astro’s Playroom, and it’s one of our key picks for PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-astro-s-playroom">2. Astro’s Playroom</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you already have, or plan on getting, a PlayStation 5 then you’ll have Astro’s Playroom already pre-installed on the console. This game is pretty short but it’s got huge appeal. Astro’s Playroom is more than a tech demo for the PS5. It’s a culmination of what Sony has accomplished with the PlayStation over the years. </p>



<p>In addition to featuring the DualSense controller’s unique capabilities, players can uncover hidden collectables that contain renderings of past PlayStation consoles, controllers, and accessories. A gacha machine, within the game, can also yield additional memorable goodies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania">3. Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super Monkey Ball has kept the good times rolling for years, literally. Banana Mania will keep kids busy for hours. The game is a compilation of over 300 stages from the original Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe. </p>



<p>Whether you’re speeding directly to the goal, or collecting every banana for a perfect run, there’s no wrong way to enjoy these games. The DualSense controller’s motion controls make this one an easy pick. Kids can also customise their characters and play several minigames involving racing, bowling, soccer, and baseball.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-justice-league-cosmic-chaos">4. Justice League: Cosmic Chaos</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When the kids have a superhero itch that needs scratching then Justice League: Cosmic Chaos is just the thing. Play as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in a light-hearted action-adventure to stop the prankster, Mr. Mxyzptlk. </p>



<p>That is not a typo. It’s got simple combat but boasts lots of DC Comics Easter eggs, humour, unlockable outfits for the superheroes, and a dynamic levelling system.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-5-sonic-frontiers">5. Sonic Frontiers</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you gotta go fast in an open-world platformer, an obvious choice is Sonic Frontiers. It’s the first game in the Sonic series to truly go open-world. The Starfall Islands contain several action stages with their own challenges to complete. The real treat of the game is exploring the islands themselves. </p>



<p>Each has obstacle courses and some platform puzzles to solve. The only drawbacks are that the game has a tedious level-up system, a so-so combat system, and some texture pop-ins. But fun is always to be had when exploring up, down and all around Sonic’s surroundings.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">6. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>LEGO games are great picks for the best PlayStation 5 games for children. They’re easy to pick up and keep kids (and adults) of all ages preoccupied. Although a plethora of PS4 Lego games are forward compatible with the PS5, we’re specifically looking at Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. </p>



<p>The game features a startling 380 playable characters pulled from all manners of Star Wars medium Because the saga is within the subtitle, players can expect to visit many worlds and scenarios spanning the Prequel, Original, and Sequel trilogies. Kids can play as lightsaber users or blaster wielders alike. </p>



<p>The gameplay is also interwoven with random encounters like TIE Fighters swooping from the sky, Tusken Raider attacks, and dog fights with Star Destroyers.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-just-dance-2024-edition">7. Just Dance 2024 Edition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If parents are reading this you may recall a little thing back in the day called “Now That’s What I Call Music” compilations. The Just Dance series is the closest equivalent to that. Modern-day musical hits and those from yesteryear are set against vibrant, colourful backdrops. </p>



<p>Chances are you know what a Just Dance game entails and it says so in the title. On-screen avatars perform the dance moves while the kiddos follow along. The smartphone Just Dance app will keep track of accuracy and kids hold it in hand. Put down the controller, turn the volume up, and dance.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-ratchet-amp-clank-rift-apart">8. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is a third-person shooter action-adventure that guarantees a fun, entertaining story. This time around the conundrum is that Ratchet has accidentally opened a rift in the space-time continuum. With a lot of media nowadays covering multiple universes, kids can immerse themselves in this colourful adventure. </p>



<p>Dr. Nefarious is ever the comic foil, but now he is joined by his opposite, Emperor Nefarious who has assumed rule of his own galaxy. What’s more, is that he’s never been defeated, so go change that. Rift Apart is among the best PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>







<h2 id="h-9-kena-bridge-of-spirits">9. Kena: Bridge of Spirits</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Similar to Ratchet &amp; Clank before it, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is like you’re in control of a beautifully produced animated movie. In this action-adventure platformer, kids control Kena, a young spirit guide. Joining Kena in her adventure throughout her mystical world are small spirit companions called the Rot. </p>



<p>The Rot can assist Kena by carrying objects to solve puzzles, distract enemies, or assist in battles. Kena utilizes an enchanted staff for combat, exploration, and platforming. It may be on the short side, but exploring Kena’s beautiful world for upgrades and treasure hunting needs to be experienced by every PS5 owner.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-sackboy-a-big-adventure">10. Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the best PlayStation 5 games for children is a side-scrolling platformer similar to Super Mario Bros. Sackboy: A Big Adventure can be compared closely to Super Mario 3D World regarding its gameplay structure. However, this time around, Sackboy’s moveset has expanded to best suit a new way of play. </p>



<p>Flutter jump, roll, dive, and slap everything in your way. The generous customization features of LittleBigPlanet carry over into Sackboy. There’s no end to the hysterical cosmetic decorations. Whether platforming solo or together, Sackboy keeps the smiles coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-11-minecraft">11. Minecraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>You can’t talk about the best PS5 games for children and <strong>not </strong>name Minecraft. This classic, decade-old game is a staple for any child looking to game from a young age. It promotes healthy learning and exploration, and it’s one of the best games for new players who are just starting to explore a controller.</p>



<p>In Minecraft, you and your kids can explore an infinite open world, build whatever you can imagine, and go on an adventure that only ends when you’re ready for it to. It’s the best-selling game of all time for a reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-12-overcooked">12. Overcooked!</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>For kids who enjoy cooperative play, Overcooked is a cooking simulator with a cartoony flair. Prepare yourselves though, you have to work through the laughs to become an ultimate chef. The gist of Overcooked, and its sequel, is preparing dishes by following onscreen instructions. It’s not as simple as lading soup into a bowl. </p>



<p>Some dishes will require cooking and preparing food to order such as managing temperatures, chopping vegetables, and preparing the plate. The real challenge is doing this against a time limit and setting time aside to clean dishes for the next order.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-13-moving-out">13. Moving Out</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another fun cooperative simulator, Moving Out is not unlike Overcooked in its gameplay style. As you would expect, kids have to move household amenities like couches, fridges, and microwaves out of the house and into a moving truck. It’s not that quite simple, however, as there are hazards that can disrupt your progress. </p>



<p>Almost like Home Alone traps, players have to be wary of fires, icey flooring, and ghosts. Fortunately, for the kiddos who need to dial back on the difficulty, Moving Out has an Assist feature that can remove stage hazards and increase the time limit.</p>







<h2 id="h-14-hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged">14. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Racing games are plentiful but here’s a newly released suggestion. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a great improvement on the shortcomings of its predecessor. This sequel contains beautifully stylized racetracks that are set against home backdrops. The racetracks you can only dream of building in your house are fully realized in video game form. </p>



<p>Whether racing as miniature muscle cars, bikes, or big rigs, each with its own specifications,&nbsp; Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is one of the fastest racing games you can get your hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-15-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">15. Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another racer that is gushing to the brim with content, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is a must-have for any racer. No pun intended but developer Beenox went the extra mile with this reimagining of the original Crash Bandicoot kart racer. Nitro-Fueled brings back all the racetracks from that game plus additional racetracks from the Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Tag Team Racing games. </p>



<p>It got a lot of flak at launch for its use of microtransactions after promising there would be none. Online multiplayer is not as populated as it used to be, but the single-player story experience is solid. By this point,t it shouldn’t hurt the bank either.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>PUBG creator Brendan Greene has revealed his PlayerUnknown Productions studio is working on "an ambitious" three-game plan: Prologue: Go Wayback!, Preface: Undiscovered World, and Project Artemis.</p>
<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is a single-player open-world "emergent" survival game in which you'll use "classic" survival mechanics to explore machine learning-driven terrain generation, "challenging your limits".</p>

<p>Promising to engage with the community during development, Greene expects this project to release in early access in spring (Q2) 2025.</p>
<p>You won't have to wait so long to give Greene's second project, Preface: Undiscovered World, however. A demo is already available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">Steam</a> to give players "an early look at the innovative technology that will power the subsequent titles in the series, and eventually project Artemis". It's not faring particularly well - early adopters have put it at a "mostly negative" rating - but it's free and available to try right now.</p>
<p>As Greene explains it, though, the world will become more populated and interesting the more people visit it.</p>
<p>"In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU," Greene said. "This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback, contributes to its future development."</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Project Artemis?</p>
<p>"My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we're developing."</p>
<p>PUBG Studios, the studio behind - you guessed it - PUBG, recently unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studio-unveils-top-down-pvp-shooter-project-arc-with-real-time-shared-line-of-sight">Project ARC</a>, a new 5v5 PvP shooter viewed from a top-down perspective and featuring "shared real-time line of sight".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-4/">Fallout 4</a> arrived nearly a decade ago, and it's anyone's guess when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> will be released. Thankfully, the fan developers  at Team Folon took it upon themselves to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/" data-ref-id="1100-6525518">Fallout London</a>, an unofficial Fallout 4 mod that gives players a glimpse of the post-apocalypse in the United Kingdom. Now, Team Folon plans to go even further with an upcoming DLC release for Fallout London.</p><p>"What started as a simple hotfix has grown into something much bigger," said the team on the Fallout London Discord. "Given the scope of this update, we're aware it may make changes that impact save files, so rather than risking breaking things for a small update, we're looking to roll this into a part of our very first DLC!"</p><p>Specific details about the release date and what will be in the DLC weren't disclosed, but it was said to include new content as well as things that were cut from the original release of the mod. Additionally, Team Folon announced that it's no longer just a collective of fans, and the company is now incorporated as an official business. The team suggested that it may work on "a small indie game," but promised to "always continue to support Fallout London."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-london-just-set-a-record-on-gog/1100-6525741/" data-ref-id="1100-6525741">Fallout London was downloaded 500,000 times</a> in the first 24 hours, which is a record for the GOG store. <a href="https://fallout4london.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fallout London still has its own page</a> outside of Discord, where more information about the mod can be found. Meanwhile, a separate team is working on another ambitious and unofficial Fallout 4 mod. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-nuevos-mexico-mod-trailer-brings-the-post-apocalypse-south-of-the-border/1100-6526953/" data-ref-id="1100-6526953">Fallout: Nuevos Mexico</a> doesn't currently have a release window, but it will explore what's happening in Mexico during the events of the Fallout games.</p>

            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have shared a full breakdown of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s accessibility options.</p>
<p>While much of the options included are what you would expect as standard - things like the ability to change the subtitle font size and edit button layouts - the team has also included a welcomingly customisable action experience.</p>
<p>What this means is that players can tweak specific aspects of the game's combat and enemies, rather than just go for a blanket 'one size fits all' approach to the action's difficulty.</p>

<p>When players first boot up the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, they have the option to choose from three 'Action experience' options: Light, Moderate and Hard. However, once the game actually starts, players can then customise this Action experience further via the pause menu.</p>
<p>Here, there is the option to adjust things such as number of melee attackers, number of ranged attackers, enemy awareness speed and enemy damage.</p>

<p>"Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure.

		<p>What a great end to the year we’re having – at least in terms of game releases! I’ve had the good fortune to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/">Infinity Nikki</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/">Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island</a> and Snow Bros. Wonderland (more on that one to come). Other than those, I’ve patiently waited for Marvel Rivals to release, and I’m literally just about to hop into the first matches. Excelsior! Or… something like that.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> wrapped up Assassin’s Creed Mirage and then got back to playing Valiant Hearts which he’s been chipping away at for a little while. He says, “It’s a thoughtful little puzzle set during World War I from a time when Ubi were doing plenty of cool smaller games. I also dipped my toes in Alan Wake II before picking up Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has mostly been playing being ill in bed, but he’s been hammering Mario and Luigi which has been about the right level of challenge for his poorly brain. Oh, he also managed a couple of hours killing Skaven on Vernintide 2 multiplayer before the bronchitis really set in. Hope you’re on the mend, mate!</p>
<p>If he’s playing Destiny 2, you know he’s <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, but he’s also played other things too! Funko Pop Fusion “is a bit of a mess”, and the Jurassic Park Classic Game Collection is “a useful reminder that collision detection was awful back in the day”. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> played Phasmophobia, telling us, “It’s still great despite its janky bugginess. Also The Thaumaturge for review.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Shadow Tactics: Aiko’s Choice for review, as well as a spot of Helldivers 2 (he’s so close to getting a mech-thingy now!). He tells us, “I also picked up Astral Chain in the sales and boy-oh-boy what a game! I’m only a few hours in but already slathering for a sequel, for Switch 2 perhaps?”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing The Witcher 3 and revisiting old haunts. He says, “I’m just taking my time exploring and clearing the hundreds of question marks off the map. Also playing Overthrown for early access review. Balataro has been a massive time sink as it is very addictive when trying to get a good run going.” It wouldn’t be a What We Played without a spot of Football Manager too, continuing, “In FM24, I’ve guided Valencia to the last 16 of the Champions League and semi final of the Spanish Cup. Lost both, but competing in the league to qualify for Europe again. Not sure if the board will give me a new contract yet though, after all I’ve done for them over the last 4 seasons like winning their first European title in over 20 years.”</p>

<p>And finally there’s <strong>Tef</strong>, who dished out a beating to hundreds of fascists while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">reviewing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> this past week. He really enjoyed it, and felt that the first person view really helped get the tone and pacing just right for and Indy adventure. Now if only he could remember that it’s a “Great” circle and not a “Giant” one, that’d really help…</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

<p>With sales still increasing, Rogers said that "whilst [the sales] is great news, it also comes with some downsides, too. There are probably going to be some queues during the launch weekend".</p>
<p>"Before our announcement, when we're ordering capacity, we really didn't expect to have more than a millions people online at the same time. We've already ordered way more cloud capacity and those servers will be coming online very soon. But I do have some concerns about issues with the backend.</p><p>"We quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle as we go above a million users. Now, we've added more database shards, scaling everything we have up as far as it'll go. But we're really not sure what kind of limits we might hit. We never expected things to go this big during [early access]," Rogers added.</p>
<p>"So I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you guys so much for believing in this project. If we do run into server issues at launch, just know that we're going to be working as hard as we can to solve them."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 is now available in early access on PC and consoles. It was originally expected to release in November, but the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-by-three-weeks">had its early access release date pushed back</a> to today, 6th December, after some "server-side infrastructure work" necessitated additional work.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 announcements, the last remaining showcase before the end of the year is The Game Awards. It's also the biggest show, usually, although there have been slow years when host Geoff Keighley himself has tempered fans' expectations in advance to avoid disappointments.</p>
<p>This is not one of those times, at least according to VideoGameChronicle Founder Andy Robinson, who undoubtedly inherited a lot of contacts from his former career as an industry professional. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1864973090263900372?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Robinson teased a very big show, adding that it's not a guess.</p>
<p><em>Expecting a VERY big The Game Awards next week. Fire up the hype train. </em><em>Definitely not a guess.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps that shouldn't be surprising. 2024 may not have had as many big releases as 2023, but 2025 is looking better thanks to games like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Avowed, Monster Hunter Wilds, Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Doom: The Dark Ages, Fable, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto VI, Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, South of Midnight, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There's a solid chance to see at least some of these 2025 games at The Game Awards 2024, but Robinson seems to refer mostly to game reveals for titles we haven't really seen anything yet. This category could include the likes of Ark 2, the upcoming BioShock title, Rare's Everwild, Archetype's Exodus, Marvel's Wolverine, Monolith's Wonder Woman, the next Metro from 4A Games, and even projects we haven't heard before. Let us know in the comments which of these games (or other titles we haven't mentioned) you'd like to see unveiled.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of candidates</a> for the coveted Game of the Year award:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
</ul>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 goes live on December 12 at 4:30pm PT / 7:30p ET / 12:30a+1 GMT from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-redemptions-top-1-million-queues-over-the-weekend-are-expected/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's Path of Exile 2 Early Access launch is setting out to be a smashing success, considering the huge number of EA redemptions reported by developer Grinding Gear Games.</p>
<p>A few hours ago on X, the Path of Exile 2 developer confirmed they reached 1 million Early Access redemptions, thanking players for the unexpected level of support. With so many players, however, unforeseen issues may arise during the launch window, and queues during the weekend should be expected, according to the developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve just reached 1 million Early Access redemptions. The support you have all shown for Path of Exile 2 Early Access is far beyond anything we could have ever predicted. However we want to be upfront with you all and let you know there may very well be queues over the weekend. <a href="https://t.co/bwGpsVNdGU">pic.twitter.com/bwGpsVNdGU</a></p>
<p>— Path of Exile (@pathofexile) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The smashing success of the Path of Exile 2 Early Access release is completely deserved. The very first version of the second entry in the series will launch with<a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/"> a lot of content</a>, which includes six playable classes with two Ascendancy classes each, three story acts, and a fully featured endgame that introduces new mechanics that will push the gameplay mechanics to their absolute limits. Everything that Grinding Gear Games revealed so far only reinforced the positive opinion I had of the game after having tried the game during Gamescom earlier this year.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Early Access launches later today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the full game will be free-to-play like its predecessor, the Early Access version is only available after purchasing any of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporter packs.</a></p>

But the true concurrent figure will be much higher given Marvel Rivals launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also (Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems to be going down well on Steam, too, with a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating from over 5,700 reviews (76% of the reviews are positive). Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</a> to find out what we think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins. But is it paying off? The game is currently third in Steam’s top-sellers list, which is sorted by revenue, behind only the pricey Steam Deck and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile 2. This suggests Marvel Rivals is already convincing players to open their wallets.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/unnamed-11-1733478165414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel Rivals Twitch Drops Season 0.

This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>Eternal Strands, the debut game from Yellow Brick Games, now has a release date and you will not have to wait much longer for it. Eternal Strands will be available on January 28th, and it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass. Yellow Brick Studios has also revealed a partnership with Square Enix’s Creative Studio III for some free post launch content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Jeff Skalski, COO and Executive Producer at Yellow Brick Games said, <em>“As a long-time fan of Square Enix and the games Creative Studio III have made under the helm of Naoki Yoshida, member of Square Enix’s board of directors, and studio head of Creative Studio III, this is a dream come true for all of us here at Yellow Brick Games. To first have the opportunity to create our own original fantasy IP and then have the chance to work with the Creative Studio III team to further enrich it with all-new content is just a once in a lifetime moment. As an independent studio working on our first game, we will forever be thankful to them. I can’t wait for the players to experience the new cool designs from the master artist Yusuke Mogi when our first free post-launch update for Eternal Strands arrives in the spring of 2025.” &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Eternal Strands’ story puts players in the shoes of Brynn, a Weaver on a mission to push back the Surgeborn and reclaim her people’s home. Brynn has access to magical abilities and weapons to aid in her fight that will take her across expansive world of the Enclave where everything can be explored. Players will be able to climb mountains and create paths using magic. It is a world fraught with dangers and giant enemies, which are seen in the above trailer.</p>

		<p>“Stay away from the water” is pretty easy advice to follow in many parts of the inhabited world, but it’s less handy when you’re trapped on an underwater research station that has awoken some kind of deep sea terrors. That’s exactly what you will encounter in sci-fi horror shooter Deepest Fear.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEEPEST FEAR™ | Horror FPS | Worldwide Exclusive Reveal | 4K 60fps" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So what the heck are you doing down there? Dr. Danni Carrol has to fight to the heart of this secret project, which has been masterminded by her estranged father. Whatever he’s been up to, it’s brought bizarre watery monsters out of the ocean. Thankfully they can still be blasted with a big gun.</p>
<p>Inspired by 80s horror action films like The Abyss, The Thing, and The Fly, and Total Recall, you’ll immediately spot the retro futuristic tech that sets the visual aesthetic of Deepest Fear’s world. For the gameplay it leans in on Metroidvania world design and FPS immersive sims, where there’s puzzles to unravel and a degree of improvisation that’s possible to get the job done.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty great looking reveal, to my eye, feeling a bit like modern horror classic Alien: Isolation thanks to that retro-futuristic tech, but then with a much greater emphasis on combat and gunplay. This will be really interesting to keep tabs on as development continues.</p>

<p>Developed and self-published by Variable State, there’s no word on release date targets or platforms beyond PC.</p>

            <p>Gwent, the card game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, is finally getting a physical release.</p>
<p>It's been almost 10 years since the release of the video game, which has spawned a couple of spin-off card games in The Witcher: Thronebreaker and mobile app Gwent, but only now is a physical reproduction of the game being created.</p>
<p>The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to replicate the full experience from The Witcher 3, and will have variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p>

<p>It will cost £44 and arrive in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>The set is being created by Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games, which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming - an Asterix set is also planned for next year.</p>
<p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said Rob Trounce, marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK.</p>
<p>"After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package - whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p>

            <p>NetEase Games' free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter Marvel Rivals has got off to a rather heroic start on Steam.</p>
<p>Following its debut earlier today, the game - which boasts a vast roster of characters from across the Marvel universe - has managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are still 181,057 Marvel-ites (not sure that is actually a word, but let's go with it for now) still battling it out amongst each other. This number may well rise further again over the weekend, when we are free from the shackles of the work week.</p>

<p>It isn't all numbers and no praise. Marvel Rivals currently sits with a "mostly positive" review average on Steam.</p>
<p>"Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right," reads one positive review. "Finallyyyyyy, a game that's actually fun," adds another. "First off, the team is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic - I just love it."</p><p>One area the game is receiving particular praise for, is its roster of characters. Prior to its launch, the team confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-next-five-characters-have-been-confirmed-heres-the-list">Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist, Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine would all be joining the line up</a>. Other characters include Iron Man, Hulk and Scarlet Witch.</p>

<p>The game itself is described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", and one which on its announcement head of Marvel Games Jay Ong called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects"</a>, and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nightdive team has worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. There are improved models, textures and environments, and there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>
