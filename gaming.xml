            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/snow-bros-wonderland-review.1069830/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/27/snow-bros-wonderland-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Every holiday growing up, we’d head off to our caravan. I spent each day embroiled in outdoor activities like riding my bike, climbing trees and skateboarding exceptionally badly, and I loved every single second of being there. When all that fresh air wore thin, the other thing I loved was the arcade. This wasn’t a huge arcade, it was a room in the central caravan site centre, with three or four arcade machines and an air hockey table that never worked. Still, this was my haven, and my first experience of classic games like Rainbow Islands and Cadillacs and Dinosaurs. There are formative moments in your life, and this place played a huge role in my love for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Snow Bros. Wonderland - Launch Trailer - PS4 | PS5 | Nintendo Switch | Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfOEWzJbNQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Snow Bros. was a major part of that. An absolute favourite amongst those machines, it was a riff on the original Super Mario Bros. game, giving you a single-screen platform arena that saw you coating enemies in snow before booting them across the screen, taking out any enemies stupid enough to get in the way, plastering them all over the place. It was the right side of chaotic, and visually appealing, and my supply of 20 pence pieces would clink satisfyingly into the beckoning coin slot until my pockets were empty.</p>


<p>This is all to say, I was astounded and eternally happy to discover that the Snow Bros. would be returning. Snow Bros. Wonderland is a sequel to the original two games, following on from their storyline, with the children of the original Snow Bros. taking up the mantle to save the kingdom from the evil King Atchich. It shifts from the 2D perspective to an isometric 3D one, but the overarching gameplay remains the same: cover the badguys in snow, and then yeet them around the screen. As a starting point, it’s a great one.</p>


<p>The team at Tatsujin, under the watchful eye of original developers Toaplan, have captured plenty of the charm of the original, though I preferred the slightly chubbier build of the original Snow Bros. to that of their slender sons. The enemies have made the jump to 3D as well, and though it’s not as immediately arresting as the original, it’s a fine attempt. The game is broken up into different worlds, with the landscape and enemies changing as you advance, each one headed by a massive enemy boss, each of which are simple, but visually appealing.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises is the challenge that you can face in Snow Bros. Wonderland – its cheery visual style belies some tough moments, particularly against the bosses. That said, it’s just the right side of challenging, and there’s plenty of reward for seeing off the final enemy or firing the last snowball into a particularly annoying enemy.</p>
<p>You’re aiming for the highest score as possible as these are then converted into a currency you can use to upgrade your Snow Bros. abilities and their visual look. I loved being able to deck them out in cute hats and boots, and they really become yours, while the slow and somewhat puny feeling attacks they have at the start soon advance into powerful and uproarious abilities later on.</p>

<p>You’ll need them too. My favourite moments were where you have to survive against a steady stream of enemies for a set amount of time, and the game pours it on here, dropping wave after wave into your area. This, in turn, lets you ride a giant snowball through a ton of enemies, resulting in a deeply satisfying combo. You can multiply that enjoyment by playing in four-player co-op too, as there’s plenty of amusement to be had yeeting snowballs at each other on the way to clearing an area.</p>
<p>The only yellow mark in the snow is that the Nintendo Switch version of the game has a poor frame rate when docked. It’s not aggressively bad, with inconsistent dips, but you’ll notice it the moment you start playing. It’s still playable, but it makes the game feel hastily put together when that isn’t the case. Things improve greatly when you play in handheld mode, and everything becomes brighter and more vibrant here, rather than the washed-out look it has when blown up on a TV, and I happily played here for many hours through the campaign.</p>

			<p>It might not be much longer until we actually see something new about Everwild. The upcoming project in development at Rare has been shrouded in mystery ever since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> over five years ago at the X019 special event hosted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>While the game received <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-new-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another trailer</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, Rare studio head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-gameplay-ideas-are-still-being-brainstormed-says-rare-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> at the same time that gameplay ideas were still being brainstormed. In 2021, reliable rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Everwild project had restarted from scratch, with an 'optimistic' 2024 release window target we now know wasn't met. Later that year, insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that even the people working on it still weren't quite sure what it would become.</p>
<p>The silence continued to stretch until late last year when Rare <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-fans-hopes-are-rekindled-by-new-job-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a video producer ad for Everwild. You don't hire a video producer unless the game has made it far enough in development that you can think about producing video content to share with the public. Sure enough, even insiders are starting to align, with Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing</a> in October that the gameplay loop has finally been nailed down and development is finally progressing well.</p>
<p>Now, Rare has decided to greet its Instagram fans with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD_nmQTs-3a/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everwild themed Christmas card</a> this year. Needless to say, this fueled hopes that we might see this title again at some point next year, perhaps during the regular Xbox Summer Showcase. This doesn't necessarily mean it would launch next year, of course, but if even the developer is starting to tease it, a new trailer might be on the way.</p>
<p>It would certainly be nice if Rare clarified what it's going to be about. From the brief trailers we previously got, it looks as if the players will explore a vast wilderness while helping animals rather than hunting them, as in most games.</p>

<p>Role-playing games, or RPGs, are one of the most popular genres of games out there. RPGs cater to everyone from kids to adults to the elderly—you just have to find the one that fits your playstyle best! That’s why we’re here to present the top five most influential RPGs of all time so you can see the game that’s right for you. These are listed in no particular order.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-rpgs-everyone-should-play-once-in-their-lifetime">Five RPGs Everyone Should Play Once in Their Lifetime</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Witcher 3</a>, developed by CD Projekt RED and released in 2015, is an action RPG where you play as the character Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is a Witcher, a monster slayer for hire, looking for his adopted daughter Ciri after she disappeared years before trying to escape the Wild Hunt, a group of spectral warriors led by their king, Eredin. Many other characters appear in this game, including, but not limited to, Yenefer of Vengerberg, Triss Merigold, Dandelion, Zoltan Chivay, and Vesemir. The player’s choices within the game can lead to several different endings!</p>



<h3 id="h-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-best-games-like-skyrim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim</a>, a 2011 action RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is one of the most popular RPGs ever. Playing as the Dragonborn, a customizable character that can be one of nine different humanoid races, the player must save the world from Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon dead-set on destroying the world due to prophecy. Players can join many factions, side with a group for Skyrim’s civil war, choose to be good or evil, and choose from many different fighting or magic combat styles. Skyrim is popular because each player’s journey can end up differently, even if the main story concludes similarly each time.</p>



<h3 id="h-bloodborne">Bloodborne</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a> is a 2015 action RPG developed by FromSoftware in which the player plays as a Hunter who fights through the city of Yharnam, attempting to find the source of the blood-borne plague affecting residents. Bloodborne is a Soulslike game, meaning combat is harsh, unforgiving, and relies on precise hits and timely dodging to avoid getting killed. The player character is quite customizable, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world of Bloodborne.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-ii">Diablo II</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Diablo II, a 2000 action RPG developed by Blizzard North, is centered around dark fantasy and horror themes and is comprised of four acts. Each act follows a predetermined path, but levels are randomly generated, allowing for a unique experience each time the game is played. The base game has five unique classes: The Amazon, The Necromancer, The Barbarian, The Sorceress, and The Paladin. The expansion Diablo II: Lord of Destruction adds two more classes: The Druid and The Assassin. The game’s purpose is to defeat Diablo in Hell and prevent his return, and each act in the game leads up to that final fight.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy VII is a 1997 RPG developed by Square (also known as SquareSoft) that follows the exploits of the character Cloud Strife, a mercenary trying to stop a megacorporation from using the planet as an energy source. Cloud fights alongside many characters who are also trying to save the planet. Many factions, including AVALANCHE, SOLDIER, and the Cetra, are in the game, all trying to fight against Shinra Electric Power Company and the Turks, a secret branch of Shinra’s security forces. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen. While in “the field,” players can traverse areas found within the world map and explore, talk with characters, and advance the story through events. Of course, if the old-school graphics prove too much for you, there’s always the remake!</p>



<p>While these games are influential in many ways, they don’t even touch the number of RPGs available on the market. This list is meant to give you five very different types of RPGs, stories, and gameplay mechanics from some of the most influential companies and games.

			<p>For those who are excited about the release of Assetto Corsa EVO, it's been confirmed by KUNOS Simulazioni that the title will be getting an open-world map that will come in the Summer of 2025, with the game set to enter <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/">Early Access on Steam on January 16, 2025</a>. Those who have access to Steam and a suitable PC rig will be able to purchase the game and experience it. It's not said whether the game is planned for a release on console in the future after the Early Access period. All of this news was announced in the new keynote video released by 505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni, which you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everything you need to know about Assetto Corsa EVO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZlW9vYZbFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is set to get a lot of new features and content for those who love the virtual racing experience. This includes an authentic and faithful recreation of Eifel, a region in Germany that surrounds the infamous motorsports complex, Nürburgring. This open-world map is set to be released in the Summer of 2025, with the specific release date to be announced at a later date. It's been said that it'll be released in stages so that the team has the opportunity to provide continuous updates and new content to the game as it expands and nears its full release date.</p>
<p>The open-world map will also allow players to have an immersive level of interaction with other players, as well as the opportunity to interact with businesses and the option to rent cars or upgrade their vehicles via the aftermarket.</p>
<p>"Assetto Corsa EVO is primarily a love letter to the automotive world and the petrolheads' lifestyle. Our concept of 'open world' is designed to let players enjoy every single car to its fullest, whether on the rack or public roads, experiencing the pure driving pleasure and simply enjoying the ride," said Marco Massarutto.</p>
<p>When Assetto Corsa EVO releases in Early Access on Steam, it will include 20 cars to choose from, as well as five circuits across four Continents. The game is set for a full release in Fall 2025, where the game will have 100 cars by that point and 15 officially licensed circuits at a minimum, with more to come as free updates.</p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is now available to be <a href="https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu81-2BxBWpoO13W1-2FJkr1waHxoUFfDV7yVfDglC2AUHrPfTy32OfPiTktnNCzdGuyzXHLgftEhrCjGAhCCDRfZYLTo-3DYUqS_wgpRUt1ukdaFRZYh9QrZG4eYzWlxCkemZe-2BsgPLtG-2FmybzPL2GfDQWiCWmTUvAuLStlYFGYu0XMbHZPcfwEvPr2K7NvGT5mlTwowLnX9JReq1NCR4DybycmQIAsy2M4nNuO4Rg-2B2rGHPCD-2BJI77VlSgCtzhW0f8QKoXVdP1d9IFabm9M2wfYUvGXScMvvEyU8ujoMJcQEbXhRJLx0AZtMVr8wl1Iiihjtm4i3sdFKYXxWdUuKlJIdEhwwSFUHsqh9bRcqy3IAL8RCvGezk69wUzVNsvpWMYQenOSUMUFshjwKuaW9GbCRJIHmenE4gkJFzddty3MisGm-2FECbQyuUouwXsgp2SAEdUEMojmFz02RKQr3x6xodqVnACAJ7DIEVMVWIyn1LgpsOJEkqj3fVZl2Q4Z1H0WM3cXqFAlTg97hDefk0pun5nV9MJ2XkN2MH-2BCuYah-2F7PJw9D5TSecWuTrDp6P08ue4RYF68mO8GVUCvI9c8bgatnuAQenlM4tMR0bPfXdJlLJj-2Fu5TapoG89w-3D-3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam right now</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hitpoint-press-humblewood-setting-is-now-pay-what-you-want<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hitpoint Press has offered TTRPG fans an enticing sale this holiday season. The publisher behind many beloved books and products, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deck-of-many-animated-things-and-spells-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Deck of Many,</em></a><em> </em>has announced that two of their campaign settings, <em>Humblewood</em> and <em>Heckna</em>, are now available as pay-what-you-want.</p>



<p>Humblewood and Heckna's announcement as pay-what-you-want happened somewhat unceremoniously on Hitpoint Press' official web store. As the phrase implies, you can now buy a PDF of either the Humblewood campaign setting or the Heckna campaign setting books for whatever amount you decide. Pay a dollar. Pay ten dollars. Pay whatever, the choice is yours.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/humblewood-heckna-store-screenshot.jpg?itok=F_40lBE3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/humblewood-heckna-store-screenshot.jpg?itok=UH6oqGTJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both of these settings utilize the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e SRD and bring their own unique fantasy to the table.</p>

<p><em>Humblewood</em> is a world entirely occupied by intelligent animals, similar to Brian Jacques' influential Redwall novel series. It contains 10 playable player species, new subclasses, and a prewritten adventure for characters levels 1-5. It's a setting so popular it is even available as a third-party supplement on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Heckna</em> is a dark carnival setting. A world where various attractions and performers are actually gruesome monsters in disguise. The PDF is both a campaign setting and a prewritten adventure for characters level 1-10. It contains new magic items, a bestiary, a set of safety tools for mindful play, and a "Shuffled Stories" engine designed to remix elements of the campaign on each playthrough.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heckna-frightened-adventurers.jpg?itok=PGjD4C2o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heckna-frightened-adventurers.jpg?itok=Li-D6OCa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This doesn't mean <em>Humblewood</em> or <em>Heckna</em> are no longer supported. Hitpoint Press has produced lines of miniatures, GM Screens, and playing cards for Heckna. As for <em>Humblewood</em>, the setting has spawned several prewritten adventures and supplements like <em>Humblewood Tales</em>, as well as an official comic written by Gail Simone.</p>

<p>Hitpoint Press has a respectable reputation in the TTRPG industry thanks in part to their <em>Deck of Many</em> product line alongside TTRPG books nad supplements helmed by prominent creators in the space. These works include <em>Fool's Gold</em> and <em>Hexbound</em> by YouTube personalities DIngo Doodles and Pointy Hat.</p>

<p>As described on its <a href="https://grahamgentz.itch.io/breaking-the-vault-of-viditya-voleti" rel="nofollow">Itch page</a>, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> is a nonlinear collaborative game where your group becomes a team of criminals on a heist that goes wrong.</p>

<p>The group decides on the setting of the heist and their final goal. That goal can be assassination, rescuing a prisoner, or sabotaging a doomsday weapon. The setting can be in Ancient China, World War 2, or even in a dieselpunk fantasy setting. Either way, the group is given an ultimatum and most fulfill their mission.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, character and context is revealed, culminating in a death scene where the group succeeds thanks to one character's sacrifice. The players themselves must decide if this act of selflessness was out of genuine character growth or not. To quote the game's description, "You are not a good person, but will you die that way?"</p>

The titular Viditya Voleti has a distinct body of work, producing system-agnostic fantasy work as well as the competitive card game <em>The Anatomy of Fear</em>.</p>

<p>The author, Graham Gentz, has similarly eclectic work, including <em>Immortal Lich Henry Kissinger</em>, <em>Aggressively Strange: Sailing The Spooky Wildsea</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/under-autumn-strangely-pastoral-horror-and-shared-stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Under The Autumn Strangely</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, 100% of all sales of <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> will go to the <a href="https://southernequality.org/tyep/" rel="nofollow">Trans Youth Emergency Project</a>. This nonprofit organization provides logistical and financial support for transgender youth throughout the American South. This includes travel expenses, medication, as well as mental health and wellness needs.</p>

On December 25, however, they returned to X (formerly know as Twitter) to do exactly that. “This holiday season, I couldn’t resist sharing this gift with you all,” they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span>. “Some might call it an early reveal… but I call it the best-kept secret of the year.” The message was accompanied by a photo showing a hand holding an alleged Switch 2 sideways in what looked like a hardware testing workroom. </p><p>The ravenous Switch 2 leak community immediately honed in on weird artifacting and mismatching in the image to accuse it of being an AI-generated fake. NextHandheld later followed up with a second post sharing an alleged image of the Switch 2 dock, cheekily writing, “It’s all just AI generated.” There were once again weird anomalies in the background and the outline of the console. Looking more closely at the images shared, believers speculated that the breaks were too clean to be AI-generated and instead indicated that, likely to protect their identity and the location where the photos were taken, NextHandheld had simply used AI to replace everything in the images <em>but</em> the hardware itself.</p><p>One user on the Switch 2 subreddit, DoctorHoneywell, compared various contours and dimensions from a previous alleged Joy-Con leak and found the photos from NextHandheld were a very close match, possibly indicating that both were in fact from a production unit approximating the final build design and shape. “It could be a really high quality resin 3D print with a well done finish, and then custom stickers on it. It could be really good photoshop job over an AI image,” DoctorHoneywell concluded. “But that would mean that I was still right with what I have said every single time I’ve been asked about this before they came out: It’s either real, or a high quality fake.”</p><p>The debate waged throughout Christmas Day, and NextHandheld’s own poll shared on X had 60 percent of roughly 4,000 respondents believing the leaks were legit and the rest thinking they were elaborate fakes. The mysterious leaker is also promising to reveal new details in the days ahead. Other once-prominent Nintendo leakers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..">like Pyoro, who previously confessed</a></span> to having a source with access to Nintendo’s website backend, have also tried to get in on the action, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but without sharing anything definitive</a></span>. For some, the entire thing is reminiscent of the notorious 2018 “Grinch leak” about <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>’s roster. That one turned out to be a carefully crafted scam. Is NextHandheld pulling a similar trick?</p><p>The stakes around these leaks remain quite low. Unless everything that has so far trickled out has been completely made-up and off-base, all available rumors and reporting point to Nintendo’s next console likely being pretty similar to the existing Switch, just with upgraded specs. Every time it feels like speculation around the Switch 2 might be dying down again, a new data point arises for fans to argue about, and it seems likely that will keep happening until Nintendo finally reveals official information. The company’s promised to do so by April 2025, and the time for its big traditional February Direct is quickly approaching.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The narrative-focused RPG chronicling the struggle of misfit adventurers on a quest to save the world held my attention like little else. Its slow-burn story told through text boxes on pre-rendered backgrounds, all backed by a soaring melodic score, was unlike any piece of media I encountered before. Before the decade was up, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> arrived and delivered more of the same for me. In the early 2000s, however, <em>Final Fantasy </em>changed, and I thought I’d never experience <em>that</em> kind of game for the first time again. That is, until I fired up <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> and was instantly transported back to the late ‘90s. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735"><em>Final Fantasy VII: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>And if you’re like me and have been craving those original PlayStation <em>Final Fantasy</em> vibes, then you absolutely need to give <em>Fantasian</em> a spin.</p><figure id="" data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re only now hearing about <em>Fantasian</em>, there’s probably a good reason for that. Developed by Mistwalker and produced by the father of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, Hironobu Sakaguchi, <em>Fantasian</em> was originally locked behind Apple Arcade’s iOS and Mac ecosystem when it launched in April of 2021. Like <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles of the late ‘90s on the original PlayStation, it features a fixed camera perspective and 3D character models animated over pre-made backgrounds. It also features a soundtrack written by legendary <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer Nobuo Uematsu. Three years after its initial release, <em>Fantasian </em>arrives on modern consoles and PC via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840"><em>Neo Dimension</em></a></span>, an updated version with spruced-up graphics, difficulty adjustments, some tweaks to the gameplay to adapt its mobile origins, and voice acting. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840">How Long Is <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>?</a></span></p><p>While <em>Fantasian</em> is a video game produced in the 21st century for mobile platforms, it is eerily capable of transporting you back to the simpler times of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, <em>8</em>, and <em>9</em>. This is especially the case if you mute the new voice acting and just let the text boxes do the dialogue and exposition for you (which, with all due respect to the voice talent that went into bringing the characters to life, I think is the better way to play <em>Fantasian</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>FF</em> titles of the late ‘90s, however, the backgrounds in <em>Fantasian </em>weren’t created with computer graphics, but instead were produced with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual physical dioramas</a></span> that were photographed from multiple angles. Though it gives a distinct, and <em>gorgeous</em>, look to <em>Fantasian</em>, the experience in motion is very similar to old-school <em>FF </em>titles. <em>FF7 </em>in particular always had a hand-crafted look to its backgrounds that contributed to its charm. The world feels intentional, with an eye toward making it feel like a memorable place, inspirationally crafted to transport you to a fantasy realm. Toss in some turn-based combat, random encounters, and a hybrid fantasy/science-fiction narrative about an amnesiac protagonist and, well, if you were a <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan in the late ‘90s, this should all sound very familiar. And speaking of sound, oh boy, will <em>Fantasian</em> <em>sound</em> familiar. Just listen to this battle theme:</p><p>And compare it to the melodies in this classic <em>FF</em> jam:</p><p>The soundtrack is filled with moments like this, stirring up our memories of the epic adventures of yesteryear through melodies and motifs that sound familiar to ‘90s-era <em>Final Fantasy</em> tunes or just through Uematsu’s signature melodic and compositional styles. It’s some of his finest work. </p><p>As someone who always felt that a certain charm was lost when <em>Final Fantasy</em> started changing its overall structure in the early 2000s with <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, <em>Fantasian</em> has successfully filled several late evenings for me with a kind of wild neo-nostalgia that I’ve always wanted to experience, but have never expected from modern games. In its presentation and narrative, <em>Fantasian</em> literally feels like a hidden PSX <em>FF</em> title. </p><figure id="" data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a few rough edges here and there, and you can sense the mobile origins of the game from time to time via the UI and the fact that the combat wants you to line up targets in a row in a way that would probably feel more natural on a touch screen. And while the story is perfectly entertaining, it’s not hitting the way <em>FF7</em>’s or <em>FF8</em>’s does. (Then again, it also has to compete with the two decades of nostalgia I’ve built up for Cloud and Squall’s tales.)</p><p>But really, those rough spots matter very little as the game nails the overall pacing and tone of storytelling and dialogue that brought late-‘90s <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles to life. I’ve yet to hit the game’s infamous “Part Two,” which I’ve heard comes with a wild difficulty spike (and I’m playing on “Hard” difficulty), but I’ve been spending evenings grinding out my characters in preparation for that…which, honestly, is what I used to do in <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> anyway.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fantasian</em> is shaping up to be one of my favorite games of 2024, even though it’s a psuedo-remaster of a 2021 title. It is the kind of game I’ve been aching to play for nearly 25 years. If you’ve been glancing at screenshots since the game’s original release a few years ago, admiring the dioramas and wondering if it could cast the same spell as those late ‘90s PSX <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, then wonder no more and give <em>Neo Dimension</em> a try.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After season one ended with Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), also known as Player 456,  choosing to search for the people behind the game instead of boarding a flight to Los Angeles to reconnect with his daughter, we catch up with him two years later as he’s contracted a group of people to search for The Salesman (Gong Yoo), the man who recruits people into the game. The formerly naive Gi-hun is now a radicalized vigilante with a makeshift shooting range and illegal guns in his hotel room. But, that’s not the only change this season. </p><p>Over seven episodes, <em>Squid Game</em> introduces its first transgender character, shows us someone being recruited to be a guard, and turns more children’s games into chaos creators. It’s not all good, as some of the second season’s changes left us yearning for more. But one thing is for sure: these changes make it abundantly clear that we are entering the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> as a series. Let’s cherish them while we can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central tension of the show has always been rooted in the deadly consequences of playing the show’s twisted versions of children’s games. In the past, <em>Squid Game </em>has turned Red Light, Green Light into a massacre machine, throwing marbles into a breeding ground for lethal deception, and literally put lives in people’s hands with Tug of War. The new season gives still more traditionally harmless games a murderous twist.</p><p>Before the season gets to the island for the start of the competition, the Salesman merges double-handed Rock, Paper, Scissors with Russian Roulette. After capturing Woo-seok (June Suk-ho) and Mr. Kim (Oh Dal-su), two of the men tasked by Gi-hun to find him, he forces them to each throw out a choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors with each of their hands before taking one choice back and determining the winner based on the final selections. The loser got a gunshot to the temple, with the chance that the hammer could come down on an empty chamber. As we saw, the split-second nature of having to observe what your opponent played and choosing which of your hands to take back led to Mr. Kim acting on instinct alone, instincts that convinced him to spare his younger flunky. </p><p>Later, the season introduced a six-legged pentathlon in which six contestants each tie one of their legs to another’s while moving through a course that has them playing five games—Ddakji, Flying Stone, Gongi, Spinning Top, and Jegi. Outside of Ddakji, the other four were all new additions. But none of those produced heart-wrenching results like the final new game introduced in the second season: Mingle.</p><p>In Mingle, contestants stand on a spinning platform surrounded by a number of open rooms. When the platform stops spinning, the announcer speaks out the number of people that must be grouped together and in one of the rooms by the time the timer stops. Anyone left out of a room when the timer is out gets shot dead, along with contestants in a room with the incorrect number of (alive) players. Alliances are formed and broken within minutes, depending on what is asked of them to survive, and the mad dash to doors turns into contestants physically trying to keep others out of their rooms, effectively killing them. This was the first game of the season that made it abundantly clear to the contestants that teamwork is a survivalist illusion, and saving yourself ultimately will come down to killing others.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Following the death of game creator Oh Il-nam (O Yeong-su) at the end of Season 1, it looks like the head of the games In-ho (Lee Byung-hun) took what he learned from last season and expanded it. In the first season, contestants were only given one opportunity to vote on whether the games should continue or stop without any compensation. While the majority voted for the games to stop, they all returned back to the murder lottery after spending a day in their depressing realities. In true <em>Squid Game</em> fashion, one of the few parts of the competition that had any sort of moral fiber was twisted into another opportunity for those working the game to engineer more competition. </p><p>In the second season, players get to vote on the game’s continuation after every competition. To make the decision even harder, players receive an equal share of the prize money if the majority votes to leave. It grows deadlier the deeper into the competition the contestants go, especially when players wear a patch of their choice. The people who vote to stay typically feel as if more money is the only way to save their lives from the debt that could lead to their deaths. The people who vote to leave believe they’d rather be alive and broke than risk their lives for the hopes of a little more money. Even though their decisions are conflicting, they’re both rooted in survival, which inherently puts anyone voting against their decision in opposition to them living. What results from that is one of the bloodiest group fights in <em>Squid Game</em> history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is either blatant foreshadowing of the next winner in <em>Squid Game</em>, or Netflix is about to venture into a dark place of no return. In this season, Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), is revealed to be pregnant with the child of fellow contestant Player 333, Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan) after he ghosts her. She’s in the competition because she lost her money due to following Myung-gi’s terrible investment advice. Regardless of why she’s there, she’s officially the first pregnant woman in <em>Squid Game</em> history, which means her death could be unprecedented in the worst way.</p><p>Outside of the young guards who get killed in both seasons, <em>Squid Game</em> has pretty much excluded children from risking their lives. Given that Jun-hee’s pregnancy wasn’t overtly visible, it’s possible the organizers of the game were unaware of her bringing a fetus into a warzone. However, a child’s life being decided by their parent’s desperation is the type of social experiment <em>Squid Game</em> has come to be known for. Luckily she survives Season 2, but that doesn’t mean she or her child are in the clear just yet. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gi-hun has had a one-track mindset since winning the 45.6 billion  in the first season of <em>Squid Game</em>: stop the people running the game. His first plan fails after the organizers remove the tracking chip implanted in the molar of one of his teeth meant to guide former police officer Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun) and his team to the remote island that has eluded him for two years. Well, if you can’t bring them to justice, take them to hell. That, or some version of that mentality, was clearly at play when he staged the first attack on the guards by the contestants.</p><p>He doesn’t only remember the games he played in his first go-around, but also the human dynamics that often had depraved results. Once the contestants’ voting reached its first draw, requiring votes to be cast again the following day, Gi-hun knew those who voted to stay would see bedtime as a golden opportunity to take out dissenters from the other side of the voting aisle. He acknowledged that his plan would require fellow contestants to lose their lives, giving him and his collaborators the chance to play dead themselves before attacking guards coming out check their vital signs.</p><p>Even though his plan led to mass casualties, and was ultimately thwarted by In-ho secretly playing as Player 001, Gi-hun now knows the game’s once-impenetrable fortress has exploitable vulnerabilities. Hopefully his attack destabilized their defenses enough for his cavalry to come in and save the day. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should’ve seen this coming when show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>that he envisioned the second and third seasons as one season until he realized there were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many episodes</a></span>. Let me speak for the rest of us binge warriors who have routinely dedicated 30 hours of streaming to watch an entire 30-episode series in one weekend: there can never be too many episodes. As a result, the second season of <em>Squid Game </em>is good, but not as satisfying as the first season, which Dong-hyuk also admits was as far as he originally planned for the story to go. </p><p>The primary issue with the truncated season is that the stakes aren’t high enough for viewing interest to be guaranteed much longer. As of now, the third season will show what ramifications will be levied against players for threatening to kill the organizers, how voting on the game’s continuation will change after the bloodbath, whether Gi-hun’s backup arrives in time, and who ultimately will win the competition. Outside of the mutiny, we’ve experienced these stakes in the first season, but they all felt a bit higher because it was our first time. Plus, <em>Squid Game</em> is less of a mystery-style thriller and more of an action thriller that derives its suspense from us clicking to the next episode and finding out how else this show will depict the survival of the fittest. </p><p>While <em>Squid Game</em>’s third season will arrive sometime in 2025, cutting the final season into two parts wasn’t a smart move. Still, if it helped Dong-hyuk get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more money</a></span> (and lose less teeth), then job well done. See you back on the island.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A massive leak of Halo content that contains development tools, unreleased content, and dev builds has leaked online.</p>



<p>The content is said to date back all the way to 1998 at Bungie, when the developers had just released Myth II: Soulblighter and were working on Oni and Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VISCERAL</a>, the leak contains around 90GB of data and is said to have leaked because 343 Industries hired a group of modders to try and restore cut content and data from the old games. This was known as the Digsite project, with some users familiar with the project, including one modder who had worked on the project, <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that the leak was genuine</a>.</p>



<p><em>As with all leaks of this nature, downloading them is at your own risk, and the files can be found on various social media platforms.</em></p>



<p>As for the Halo franchise today, 343 Industries renamed itself to Halo Studios in 2024 and continues developing the next Halo games. <span>As part of the announcement of its studio</span>‘s name change, the development also announced its games would be moving&nbsp;to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>



<p>Will you be checking out more of the Halo leak? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO - Everything You Need To Know" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jH5hZqNirVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>
