Now, Hideo Kojima is joining the chorus. He said at a speaking event in Sydney, Australia recently that he's a big fan of the game and particularly its relatively small team size.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a small team at Sandfall Interactive, and Kojima said it was impressive to see the studio make the game with "like 33 team members and a dog," <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-ideal-for-one-key-reason-3215153/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reported</a>. It's not exactly true that the game was made by 33 people alone, as the core team at Sandfall was helped by dozens of other people. But in any event, Kojima said a small team size like Sandfall had for Expedition 33 is "ideal."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"When I first started, it was like a team of six," Kojima said. "You could do everything yourself. Now, it's expanded. You can't really control each employee, so you delegate. But sometimes, the idea doesn't really work out because it's a bigger team."</p><p>Many modern games are developed by teams of hundreds of people, and this can feel like "factory" work, Kojima said. When teams get that big, they lose cohesion, Kojima said.</p><p>"Big companies, like 600, 1,000 people, they're full of totally different teams," he said. "Everyone's concentrating on their work and then combining together. Creation has now become much bigger. It's kind of a war between how efficient you could [be] with the small team, but you have to make it so grand."</p><p>Regarding Expedition 33's team size, Matthew Handrahan of publisher Kepler Interactive told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that the "creative engine" of the game was about 30 people. He said it's true dozens of other people from places like Korea contributed to the game, but he said "none of them were full time." Then there was a "galaxy of partners" working on the game as well, including musicians, translators, testers, and more.</p><p>Handrahan said people get "fixated" on how many people worked on Expedition 33. That's actually missing the point, though, which he said was that Expedition 33 is not a "AAA" game and that becomes obvious when you look at the game's credits.</p><p>"Some games can make it work. Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to make it work, I think we can all say with great confidence. But there are plenty of games made with very large teams and for huge amounts of money that don't land, and there is a human cost to running things that way," he said. "People lose their jobs. God knows how many layoffs there's been in the industry over the last few years."</p><p>At Summer Game Fest recently, host Geoff Keighley praised Expedition 33 in part for how it was made by a team of "under 30 developers." Many quickly pointed out that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/no-geoff-keighley-clair-obscur-expedition-33-was-not-made-by-a-team-of-under-30-developers-and-devs-say-repeating-the-myth-is-a-dangerous-path/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this is a myth</a> and that saying this downplays the critical role that people outside of the "core" group had in the making of the game.</p><p>As for Kojima, his next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and it launches on June 26 for PS5. He has multiple other games in the works as well, including OD and Physint.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alzara-radiant-echoes-developer-studio-camelia-shuts-down-due-to-lack-of-funding.1220499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-camelia-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Studio Camelia, the team behind Kickstarted RPG&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, has announced it will be closing its doors, and that development on the game is now "on an indefinite pause".</p>

<p>In a Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> posted earlier today, Studio Camelia says that prior to the Kickstarter's commencement, it had secured funding for "half the development" of&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, and that the crowdfunding campaign was intended to "reduce the perceived risk" for potential partners.</p>

<p>The studio says it used the Kickstarter money to create a new demo, but that no discussions with potential partners resulted in a publishing contract, "despite having a playable demo, a senior team, half of the funding secured, and the Kickstarter campaign".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-shuts-down-combat.jpg?itok=xav39mTu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-shuts-down-combat.jpg?itok=11jOzAaZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alzara Radiant Echoes&nbsp;</em>was to be a throwback turn-based RPG, but it's dead in the water now, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, since Studio Camelia couldn't secure funding to continue development on&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, the studio was liquidated, and development has been paused indefinitely.</p>

<p>Studio Camelia says there's a "slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project", but that this would result in a "different direction" for the game, although the studio says it hopes that direction would be "for the better".</p>

<p>Backers who gave their money to&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>' campaign won't be refunded, the studio says, and given that the game managed to make almost three times the amount the studio asked for, that's got to sting for a lot of folks.</p>

<p>Indeed, many backers are incandescent in the comments section of the aforementioned post, variously calling the campaign "scammy", "a bold-faced lie", and "full of BS".</p>




<p>Some users accuse Studio Camelia of a lack of transparency; as recently as February, an update was posted that made no mention of&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>' ongoing financial trouble, although Studio Camelia would surely have been well aware of its problems by then.</p>

<p>Additionally, some commenters say that it wasn't clear the funds they were contributing wouldn't necessarily be put towards the development of a full game, but rather a demo for investors and publishers.</p>

<p>Kickstarter is often used to fund video game development; notable success stories include the excellent&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-crowdfunding-closes-may-14" rel="nofollow">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a>&nbsp;</em>and Larian Studios'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/divinity-original-sin-2-quickly-funded-explains-gameplay" rel="nofollow"><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em></a>, which laid much of the groundwork for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</p>

<p>Still, Studio Camelia and&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes&nbsp;</em>are a cautionary tale of the ways in which crowdfunding can go wrong, although that won't be very reassuring to the backers who won't see their money returned.</p>

It’s worth it just for the sake of archiving my access to games that could otherwise get revoked by Valve or whomever at any point. And June’s collection is about to grow to 31 games, which is bonkers.

Users who backed the Kickstarter campaign will not be refunded. <span id="more-974408"></span></p><div><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>Here is an update that is very difficult for us to write. It is with deep sadness that we announce the closure of Studio Camelia. In this update, we will take the time to explain the circumstances that led to this outcome, as well as provide some clarity regarding the Kickstarter and the future.</p><p><strong>How We Got Here</strong></p><p>We founded Studio Camelia based on our love for <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,682 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPGs</a>, with the desire to bring a fresh perspective to the genre while staying true to the essence of what makes a JRPG, produced by professionals from the industry. With <em>ALZARA</em>, we wanted to create a Mediterranean-inspired JRPG, influenced by games like <em>Golden Sun</em> and <em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [141 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> X</em>, with dynamic turn-based combat and centered around the theme of “Togetherness.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The studio was officially created in May 2022, but the journey began nearly four years ago. From the very start, we fought tirelessly to bring our dream to life and were constantly seeking funding. We started the studio with our personal savings and managed to convince business angels, banks, and institutions who believed in our vision and supported us. We were even honored to be accepted into Microsoft’s Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>With all this support, we had half the development of the game covered, and only needed to secure the other half through an industry partner. However, as you know, the video game industry is currently going through a crisis. Many studios have been forced to close due to lack of funding, and over 20,000 workers have lost their jobs. Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk.</p><p>To give ourselves the best possible chance of securing funding, we turned to Kickstarter to reduce the perceived risk for some partners and reassure them of the project’s profitability. The campaign was a huge success: <em>ALZARA</em>&nbsp;became one of the most-backed Gaming projects on Kickstarter in 2024, with over 5,000 backers and nearly €300,000 in pledges. Thank you again for your support! It was an incredible time for us.</p><p>We used that success to develop a new demo of the game incorporating the latest advances on <em>ALZARA</em>. We attended various events (Tokyo Game Show, <a title="Companies > DICE [232 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/dice">DICE</a>…) to meet with potential partners from around the world. We had in-depth discussions earlier this year, but unfortunately, none of them resulted in a contract, despite having a playable demo, a senior team, half of the funding secured, and the Kickstarter campaign. We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could.</p><p>This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn’t be more true.</p><p><strong>Is There a Chance <em>ALZARA</em>&nbsp;Will Continue?</strong></p><p>The studio’s liquidation was declared on April 28. At the time of writing, various legal procedures are underway and will be ongoing for some time. As you can imagine, we are unable to share the details of these procedures, but they pertain to the liquidation of a company.</p><p><em>ALZARA: Radiant Echoes</em> is now on an indefinite pause. There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!</p><p><strong>About the Kickstarter</strong></p><p>As you know, backing a Kickstarter project comes with risks: the very idea of the platform is to give creators a boost so they can bring their projects to life. It does not guarantee the final commercialization of the project, and therefore there is always a risk it won’t come to fruition.</p><p>Neither the studio nor Kickstarter is able to refund your contribution to the project, and we are truly sorry for that. For more information, you can consult the FAQ provided by Kickstarter.</p><p><strong>A Bit of <em>ALZARA</em></strong></p><p>Before concluding this update, we’d like to share some excerpts from the demo we presented to our partners, showcasing the latest progress on the game. Sadly, this demo cannot be shared publicly for copyright reasons, and the company’s liquidation prevents us from releasing any game content. Please keep in mind that these are snippets from a work-in-progress game, and all elements shown would have been finalized during production.</p><p><strong>The End</strong></p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this message in full. If you have any questions, we will take the time to answer them as best as we can, within the limits of what we are allowed to share.</p><p>We can only imagine your disappointment upon reading this. Know that we share your sorrow. We would have loved for this project to see the light of day. We were deeply invested in the world of <em>ALZARA</em>, its characters, and its story. We would have loved nothing more than to celebrate its release with you.</p><p>From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support from day one. Thank you for believing in our project. Thank you to our community for its kindness and words of encouragement.</p><p>With all our hearts,<br>The Studio Camelia Team</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios</p>
      </div>
<p>EA never confirmed a June announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>--only that the game would be revealed sometime this summer. Many assumed a reveal would happen in June alongside the video game industry's numerous other events, but it's unclear if June is when the unveiling will be.</p><p>The official last day of summer in the northern hemisphere is September 22, but no one is expecting EA to wait that long to reveal Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">Lots of gameplay footage and details about Battlefield 6</a> have emerged from Battlefield Labs testing program, but everything seen so far is a work-in-progress and non-final. The game, whatever it ends up being called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially set to launch by the end of March 2026</a>, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> slipping to 2026, some have theorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might capitalize on the delay and launch Battlefield 6 this year</a>. That remains to be seen, however, and the company has said it's keen to avoid bringing the game to market too soon to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">help avoid having another Battlefield 2042 situation on its hands.</a></p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for the Battlefield Labs testing program</a> for a chance to try the game early.

This statue is based on the scene from the game when the duo arrives at the University of Eastern Colorado, and has been brought to life by Substance Modelworks for Dark Horse (monkeys not included).&nbsp;</p><p>Naughty Dog's 2013 post-apocalyptic action-adventure game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_last_of_us/b/ps3/archive/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review-naughty-dogs-grim-masterpiece.aspx">The Last of Us, remains a favorite among fans</a>, even today, more than a decade later.

You can check out the statue in the glamour shots below:&nbsp;</p><p>"Ellie rides atop Callus the horse, wearing her signature striped hoodie and backpack complete with her iconic pins," Dark Horse says of the statue. "Callus is brought to life with stunning details from the worn saddles to the reins, to even the branded 'J' on their leg from Jackson County. Joel walks alongside them, grounded in his rugged gear, rifle gripped in hand and pistol secure in his holster.&nbsp;</p><p>"Together, they tread slowly across a weathered concrete base, including a spray-painted Fireflies symbol, fallen autumn leaves, moss, and the ever-encroaching presence of cordyceps emerging from below."&nbsp;</p><p>The statue stands 13 inches tall, 12 inches wide, and 12.75 inches deep.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Predictions" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a72fe1248e8c/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-predictions.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>What's that? You thought the arrival of Switch 2 a mere two weeks ago would be enough to halt the hype train for a while? Oh no, no, dear readers, Nintendo is full steam ahead, reminding us what's <em>next</em> for the freshest console on the block. The next station stop: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>A Direct presentation focused on DK's upcoming adventure will be heading our way tomorrow, <strong>18th June 2025</strong>, at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT, 3pm CEST</strong>. We know that it'll be 15 minutes long and that it will contain "information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game," but that's it. The precise details are still up in the air, so strap in folks, it's time for some speculation.</p>
<p>Below, a handful of us Nintendo Lifers have shared what we're hoping to see in this DK-focused...bananza. Have a gander through our predictions and then take to the comments to share your own.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-direct/related-articles:183956 @ 1750165203 -->
<h2>Kongs &amp; cameras (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e98789382cb98/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo was proud to showcase a certain familiar face in Donkey Kong Bananza's Treehouse footage (it was Cranky Kong, in case you missed it), and I would be very surprised if ol' grandpa is the <em>only</em> Kong Kameo in the game — let's not forget, we haven't seen DK in a 3D capacity like this since the character-stuffed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>. My money's on Diddy Kong making an appearance, especially with that redesign out there, but I'll lose my mind if we see Funky.</p>
<p>The only other thing that I'd like to feel a <em>little</em> more secure about is the camera. I loved what I played at the Switch 2 Hands-On Experience a few months back, but all that tunnelling and rock smashing didn't make for the easiest camera controls. If this Direct can show me the exploration sections running 10% smoother, I'll be fully back on board.</p>
<h2>A reason to go bananas (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3892927a3439f/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing Donkey Kong Bananza at the Nintendo Switch 2 event back in April, I came away feeling slightly more concerned than elated. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast tearing through the environment and finding little ore deposits, but I can't help but wonder if that was all there is to it.</p>
<p>I'm sure Nintendo has lots more up its sleeve for Bananza, so that's mainly what I'm hoping to see. If this is truly by the team that made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> (which I still find myself doubting), then I want to see gameplay mechanics that have my jaw dropping to the floor. Smashing bits of rock is fine for a while, but I don't know if this can stretch to keep me compelled for the entire game.</p>
<h2>Lots of smashing, no frame rate drops (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33c32f48c28d1/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very, very excited about this new DK entry. I love the look of it, I love all the smashing, but I am concerned that it might end up struggling a bit in terms of its frame rate and end up making my new console feel underpowered.</p>
<p>Yes, it'll most likely be fine, I do like to worry about nothing. More positively, the idea of this Odyssey style of caper with everyone's favourite ape front and centre feels like it should have happened ages ago, and if the gameplay can match its looks I think we're in for a good time. Just make sure it's a nice, stutter-free time, too, please.</p>
<h2>K. Rool intentions (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Smash Bros. Ultimate K. Rool" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/113455f5ff6aa/smash-bros-ultimate-k-rool.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Give me a K. Rool and a pair of boxing gloves, and I'll be happy. A few more worlds and a look at some of the deeper mechanics. Maybe a deep-cut Kong or two - I've got a soft spot for DK64, so a little Lanky or Chunky would be great.</p>
<p>I'm just looking for something that doesn't pour cold water on my enthusiasm, really. I went into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Mario Kart World Direct</a> expecting to be dazzled...and it was essentially a recap of everything we already knew, and I ended up coming away significantly less excited for the game.</p>
<p>Let's try and give the hardcore fans a little more to chew on this time while ticking those mainstream messaging tick boxes, please Nintendo.</p>
<h2>Peeling off the layers (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81257345da9bb/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After feeling a bit deflated from Mario Kart's collectibles, I want to know more about what DK has to offer. I know, exciting stuff, right? But I just want some creative, fun rewards that actually feel meaningful rather than a little challenge. And Bananza's destructibility gives tons of room for that.</p>
<p>Outside of that, a little look at some of the other levels in a bit more detail, some returning faces (no one here has mentioned Dixie... tut tut), and that's about it. I don't need a deep dive, just a little teaser of what to expect. Individual game Directs don't really get me that excited anyway, but I'm ready to be surprised.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>There are our hopes and dreams for the DK Direct, but what about you? You can let us know if you share any of our predictions in the following poll, but then take to the comments to spill the beans on what else you'd like to see.</em></p>

			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment has released FBC: Firebreak, its first cooperative multiplayer game set in the so-called Remedy Connected Universe. You can read our review-in-progress <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has just released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 576.80) that delivers day-one optimizations for the game. The driver also fixes several bugs in many games, as noted in the <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.80/576.80-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official changelog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening: stability issues</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25: stability issues</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2: displays shadow flicker</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: stability issues</li>
<li>Enshrouded: crashes after launching game</li>
<li>Monster Hunter World: stability issues when playing in DX12 mode</li>
<li>Gray Zone Warfare: stability issues</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals: stability issues</li>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut: Flickering/corruption around light sources</li>
<li>GTA V Enhanced: stability issues</li>
<li>Honor of Kings: World: stability issues</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5: stability issues</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: Image corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>FBC: Firebreak, like Control and Alan Wake 2 before it, supports the full extent of the NVIDIA RTX suite. It integrates DLSS 4, including DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction to enhance ray tracing fidelity and frame rates. Additionally, all GeForce RTX gamers benefit from the NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry (a feature that <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> in Remedy's Alan Wake 2, which also runs on the Northlight engine) when ray tracing is enabled, reducing CPU and GPU Bounding Volume Hierarchies build and update times and reducing VRAM consumption.</p>

<p>According to NVIDIA, FBC: Firebreak runs 9.3x faster on average when DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction at 4K max settings on GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop graphics cards. Gamers equipped with the latest series of GeForce GPUs can play FBC: Firebreak with path tracing enabled at almost 200 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, at nearly 250 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5080, and at 362 frames per second on the GeForce RTX 5090.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Another NVIDIA-partnered game, id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages, will receive its highly anticipated path tracing update tomorrow. On top of all the aforementioned DLSS features, the game also introduces NVIDIA's Spatial Hash Radiance Cache (SHaRC) technology, which enables the efficient computation of path-traced light; moreover, Shader Execution Reordering technology further enhances the performance of GeForce RTX GPUs. NVIDIA reports that DLSS 4 accelerates performance at 4K by an average of 6.8x on GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 cards. The flagship GPU averages 234 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 registers around 167 frames per second.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In other NVIDIA DLSS updates, the vehicle combat racing game Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks recently exited Steam Early Access with support for DLSS Super Resolution. Later this week, Sloclap will launch the 5v5 multiplayer arcade football game REMATCH with integration for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-2025-terminator-2-retro-game-needed-to-be-made<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For as long as there have been video games, there have also been bad movie tie-ins. And with the exception of the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye, the ‘90s was arguably the worst decade for turning movie gold into video game slop. Independence Day? Stinker. Cliffhanger? Utter bollocks. Men In Black: The Game? We all needed neuralising after that one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its smash hit success at the movie box office, 1991’s Terminator 2 wasn’t immune from this curse. It also experienced a less-than-stellar video game treatment, published by Ocean Software on the ZX Spectrum, Amiga, and other platforms, and not one of the many versions was even close to being worthy of the film’s classic status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember playing the Ocean T2 game from way back,” recalls Mike Tucker, designer and programmer at developer Bitmap Bureau. “I think they went all-out with the blend of game designs in there, including one where you had to rewire the Terminator's arm. And then there's a sliding block puzzle [to reconfigure the Terminator’s face].”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tucker’s colleague, pixel artist Henk Nieborg, also remembers the Probe Software Terminator game, based on the first film and released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. “It was just a very simple use of the license,” he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you look at the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo versions of Terminator 2, [they’re] pretty woeful really,” Tucker concludes. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-bike-1750162786338.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">T2's iconic bike chase becomes a high-speed chase level in Terminator 2D: No Fate. | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the ‘90s, though, games like Spider-Man 2, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and Alien: Isolation have proved that the tide has somewhat turned. Making a game based on a movie is no longer the instant critical failure it once was. And with no movie studio demands to launch alongside a brand new film’s opening weekend, any developer tackling The Terminator 2 now would have as much time as needed to revisit the 34 year-old classic. With that in mind, the opportunity to potentially right the wrongs of many previous failed Terminator 2 attempts wasn’t just something that the team at Bitmap Bureau thought would be fun to do… it was something they felt they needed to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got an email from Reef Entertainment asking me if I would be interested in doing a project with them, and it would be a licensed project,” Nieborg recalls.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Terminator was on the table,” says Tucker. “And when it was offered to us, being huge Terminator fans, especially myself and Henk, it was just too good an opportunity to turn it down.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having quite a big license attached to an indie game, that's quite an unusual situation,” Nieborg adds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an unexpected offer, but a welcome one. Bitmap Bureau’s specialty is retro-style games, with a back catalogue including the top-down shooter Xeno Crisis and side-scroller Final Vendetta. And so when a retro film license arrived in their laps, the team jumped at the chance to use their skills to develop what could be the ultimate Terminator 2 video game. And so Terminator 2D: No Fate was born. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first step towards Bitmap Bureau’s goal was plotting out exactly what a Terminator 2 game would look like, down to the finest details. Afterall, with 34 years of legacy and expectations, anything less than a fully realised, ultimate Terminator 2 experience wouldn’t be good enough.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-boss-1750162815037.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Skynet Centurion, originally designed for T2 but never used, was turned into a boss for a future war level. | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's been a lot of fun adapting the various scenes of the movie into pixel form,” says Tucker. “Usually, when you make your own game, you can just do what you want. But within the confines of a license, you have to be very careful. You have to make sure you get all those iconic scenes in the movie and translate them into some kind of game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of those iconic scenes was the movie’s opening sequence. Director James Cameron offered a small, unforgettable glimpse of the future war awaiting beyond Judgement Day, with a grizzled John Connor leading the resistance against Skynet. But while this sequence is visually impactful, it’s only a fleeting moment of the movie with no obvious gameplay translation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You don't actually see that much of the future war in the first two Terminator movies,” says Tucker. “So yeah, we had to get creative.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We actually got a new boss in there,” says Nieborg, referring to the level’s main adversary. “I had to make that myself [and] get it approved by [movie production company] Studio Canal.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Luckily there was a lot of concept art flying around that we were able to make use of,” explains Tucker. “And there's one boss in particular called Centurion, [a huge mech tank] which appears on the Terminator 2 pinball table, bizarrely.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding on small scenes from the movie is only one step towards creating the perfect Terminator 2 game, though. To make the ultimate experience, Bitmap Bureau set out to represent as many of the movies’ classic scenes as they could.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-naked-1750162834727.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Depicting the T-800's naked brawl scene was a challenge solved by 'creative shading.' | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the most contentious scene was the bar fight, which has the Terminator in naked form walking around, beating up bikers,” recalls Tucker. “I think we were trying to put that off for some time. We thought there's no way we could do this. But we found a way, and I think it's great. It's a nice distraction from the rest of the game as well, which is largely run and gun. We had to be very careful what we could show below the waistline, of course. We did include some ‘creative shading’, let's say.”		</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another scene that initially didn’t translate well to the studio’s side-scrolling arcade game format was Sarah Connor’s prison escape. To create an authentic adaptation, the team had to develop and incorporate stealth mechanics and have them sit alongside the beat-em-up action. For instance, Sarah can duck into shadowy cells to avoid patrolling wardens. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can play [the level] as a stealth sequence, or you can just go around hitting the enemies with a nightstick,” explains Tucker. “But if you want to get an S-rank on that level, then you have to sneak through without getting seen.” 						</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You've got the T-1000 walking around as well,” he adds. “So if you bump into him, you're as good as dead. So yeah, you really do need to find the right time and place to hide.”		</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-stealth-1750162849876.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sarah Connor's prison escape becomes a high-stakes stealth mission. | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">34 years later is a long time after the event itself for a developer to revisit a movie to make a tie-in videogame. But how about 41 years later? Terminator 2 may be the most beloved of the legendary series, but it’s also (as the number suggests) a sequel. What stopped Bitmap Bureau going back to the 1984 original instead?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't think that was ever on the table,” Tucker says. “But maybe it will be in the future.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it's probably easier to translate Terminator 2 to a game than the original Terminator, because [in T1] you just have one invincible enemy,” he explains. “Game design-wise, that's quite tricky. I know Alien: Isolation did a good job with that, but translating that into a side-scrolling arcade game, I think would be tricky. But you never know. Perhaps we'll get to translate that [one day].”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Maybe if you play as the Terminator, then it would be fun,” Nieborg suggests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March 2025, Bitmap Bureau finally revealed their surprising project to the world. Despite initial fears of rejection, the team couldn’t be happier with the overwhelming positive response Terminator 2D: No Fate has received so far.		</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's gone down really well,” says a relieved Tucker. “I'm always really anxious when we release a game because I'm just never sure how it's going to go down. So yeah, that's made us all feel really positive, and it's given us that drive to get over the finish line and just polish the game up, get the bugs fixed, and get [it] out there.”							</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was incredible to see that reception,” agrees Nieborg. “I watched every hour to see how many views there were on YouTube. It just blew up and that was absolutely amazing to experience.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the game isn’t in the hands of players (the true quality deciders) just yet, Judgement Day is fast approaching: Terminator 2D: No Fate launches on September 5. Early signs are pointing to the game finally providing the Terminator 2 experience we always wanted, though. If that’s the case, there will no doubt be demand for Bitmap Bureau to revisit other well-known action classics from the ‘90s that never got their big video game moment.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know a few licenses which I would love to take on,” teases Nieborg. “We'll just see and let 'em come.”								</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do have other things in development, which I can't talk about,” adds Tucker. “They might be in the same ballpark, let's say. We've really loved working on T2, and I'm sure we'll work on other licensed games again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But at the same time, we're creative people and we like to create our own stuff as well. So luckily Reef Entertainment gives us that balance of working on license stuff and our own [original ideas]. So yeah, we're going to continue in that vein for some time, hopefully.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Executive Producer of Video Programming at IGN.

"Now it shows within the first 20 min. Anyone else having this issue?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 owners say they've experienced issues with Joy-Con rumble while enjoying a number of games, including vibration-heavy moments in Cyberpunk 2077 (firing the minigun is reported to be particularly energetic), and during cutscenes within The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker on Nintendo GameCube.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But a reddit thread of users tracking the issue lists other titles, too. "Got it during the final boss of Sonic Generations," wrote one disappointed fan. "Been getting it a few times playing Fast Fusion," noted another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is yet to address the warning, though fans believe it is a feature designed primarily to limit the Joy-Con's battery consumption. After all, vibration requires extra power, and while disabling the feature entirely is somewhat heavy-handed, the move will ensure your Joy-Con don't too quickly run out of juice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This keeps popping up for me, too, even when I've only played for a few minutes," wrote one concerned fan in another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l4ehel/anyone_seen_the_rumble_turned_off_due_to/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread on the issue. "Worried I have a defective Joy-Con."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, fans impacted by repeated warnings say that fully disabling controller rumble in the Switch's settings menu is their only option to avoid the pop-up continually recurring. Others say that the warning was, for them, only temporary — with the ability to recover their buzz in a matter of minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

(Post-sale, Niantic has essentially rebranded under a fresh title, Niantic Spatial, and made pursuing AR technology its sole goal.) Scopely, by comparison, is entirely gaming-focused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for other fans, particularly those who have played other Scopely titles, the change sparked concerns around the potential for increased monetisation, and of any involvement by Scopely's parent company Savvy Games, which is a product of Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of his first round of interviews since the $3.5bn acquisition was finalised earlier this month, I sat down with Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka to discuss the impact of the game changing hands, and what being owned by Scopely would really mean for fans of the hit smartphone game going forwards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We physically moved basically one block over so, you know, it wasn't too much of a change," Steranka begins, as we sit on Pokémon Go-branded deck chairs at the game's big Go Fest 2025 live event in Paris last weekend. "It was actually one of our overflow offices that we had anyways, so a really familiar space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say the most remarkable thing about this transition so far is how uninterrupted it's been," he adds. "It's very much been business as usual."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Pokémon Go, business as usual means a continually busy schedule of in-game events and additional Pokémon releases, as well as physical events such as Go Fest 2025 and the upcoming debut of a mysterious mobile event series, Pokémon Go Road Trip 2025, set to begin in the UK later this month and wrap up in Cologne in August. Throughout this, and through its acquisition period, Steranka says Pokémon Go has continued as normal — though it is, as he acknowledges, still early days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Granted, [the acquisition] fully closed during Osaka Go Fest, the team has been quite busy, and so it's probably intentionally not disruptive around this moment in time," he notes. "But the sense that I've been getting through all the conversations I've had with folks at Scopely is the way they operate is to be quite unintrusive with individual game teams. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As you know, our full development team moved over with us, and in terms of the day to day, who we interact with, we all still ladder up to Ed Woo, our team's leader within Niantic, who still is within Scopely as well."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The key thing that's maybe a little bit less of a priority is the augmented reality focus.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what will change? Let's start with a positive for most Pokémon Go fans — the likely reduction in focus of AR-focused gameplay going forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The key thing that's maybe a little bit less of a priority is the augmented reality focus," Steranka acknowledges. "It's no secret a lot of players have not been super excited about some of the AR systems that have been added to the game over the years. Moving forward, if we add any AR functionality to Pokémon Go, it'll be because we as a team really believe it's going to be a fun and exciting thing to add."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Niantic, Scopely is a company entirely dedicated to video games — something Steranka perhaps tellingly describes as a "breath of fresh air" for his own team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Philosophically it's great, or I'm expecting it to be great, to be at a company that's fully dedicated to games, because that's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he says. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/736-a-new-way-to-power-up-pokmon-is-coming-to-pokmon-go-00-00-09-1750066518265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go plans out new features months in advance, such as its upcoming new Golden Bottle Cap item.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite recent changes to increase the amount of in-game features available to fans playing remotely, and the introduction of new items such as the Lucky Trinket and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100">pricey upcoming Golden Bottle Cap</a>, Steranka says players are simply seeing the Pokémon Go team's own roadmap of features, planned months in advance, go live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's kind of funny, because I think some of the recent changes we've made in the game have been things that players have been hoping for and wanting for a while, and a lot of online chatter that I've seen has been suspicion that, like, 'Oh, this is this must be because of the Scopely acquisition'," Steranka says. "These are things we've been working on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But to be fair, Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap. We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, in terms of the game's plans for the future, and the suggestion that any new owner might come in and start adding new things to Pokémon Go's existing content schedule, Steranka says the Pokémon Go team already has "pretty much planned out for the next two years, essentially, though that does change over time as well."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shortly after the sale was first announced, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steranka sat down for a lengthy heart to heart with TrainerTips</a>, perhaps the best-known and longest standing Pokémon Go player on YouTube, for an insightful interview that aimed to soothe initial fan fears over the game's future. Months later, and with the deal now done, I ask Steranka where he thought community sentiment towards the game and its new ownership stood now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical," Steranka replies. "The biggest thing that we can do is just prove over time that this actually is a great direction for the game to go. But I do think that, especially after having that interview with TrainerTips, I've definitely seen people have a little bit more optimism for the future. It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless. So that's how I feel personally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've heard great things about Scopely. I think actions will speak louder than words, but so far, the actions have been awesome, and I have every expectation that that's going to continue over the coming years."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/736-a-new-way-to-power-up-pokmon-is-coming-to-pokmon-go-00-00-09-1750070657268.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Scopely is best known for running smash hit smartphone game Monopoly Go!</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, alongside this enthusiasm, I was keen to ask about the match-up between Niantic's now-separate Pokémon Go team and the Savvy Games-owned Scopely. In the past, Pokémon Go has frequently positioned itself as an inclusive game run by progressive leadership. I asked Steranka what the internal conversations were like around being owned, ultimately, by a Saudi-backed company, and what it might mean for the game going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That was definitely something I was curious about personally early on when I met with Walter Driver, the co-CEO and founder of Scopely," Steranka acknowledges. "I did address that head on with him, and his perspective on that really resonated with me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Number one, [the Pokémon Go] team is pretty much never gonna be engaging directly with Savvy. For the most part, they just let Scopely operate the way that they want to operate. Number two, it's always better to engage with people of all different kinds of backgrounds. And if there's any change that you'd like to make in the world, you can't really make any changes by not engaging, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And I think that actually is very, sort of central to our philosophy around Pokémon Go as a game as well. We want people to go out and meet with other folks in their community and fully believe in the power of getting face to face and finding common ground and bettering the world from that type of community-first approach. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"You can't really make any changes by not engaging.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yeah, I don't think there's going to be any major or any changes at all that is dictated down on high, from Savvy, and if anything it just means we have the funding needed to invest in areas that we've always wanted to invest in. And so that's something I've really been excited about, because there is a world where maybe we became a public company, and then we're at the scrutiny of shareholder demands on a quaterly basis. That's not really a world we're operating in within at Scopely, which is great. It can be a lot more focused on what's best for the long term health of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, SNK, another Saudi-backed company, raised eyebrows by including European football star Cristian Ronaldo in its new game Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as Ronaldo cements himself within the Saudi football leagues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I did see that," Steranka says, when I bring this up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess what you're saying is, don't expect Ronaldo in Pokémon Go anytime soon, I ask.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Definitely not," is Steranka's reply. "Yeah, that's a little bit not our vibe within Pokémon Go."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p>HGiG or not HGiG, that is the question</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you've been feeling (as this writer has) that your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> graphics look a little washed out on your TV set in docked mode, guess what? It seems a bunch of other folk have too. What's more, there's an actual reason for it, and it can be fixed. Sort of. Hooray!</p>
<p>The video above from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hdtvtest">YouTuber HDTVTest</a> addresses the issue we've encountered on an LG OLED TV set. We've had a little fiddle this morning (careful now) and we can confirm that our Switch 2 is looking much better, much richer, and more vibrant on our OLED TVs thanks to the tips in this useful breakdown of what's up with the console's HDR.</p>
<p>So, what <em>is</em> up with it? In short, there are a bunch of problems outlined here, all revolving around a setting know as HGiG (HDR Gaming Interest Group), that deals with tone mapping whilst playing games.</p>
<p>When in your HDR adjustment settings in docked mode on Switch 2, you're presented with a test pattern of two suns. Adjusting these so the one on the right disappears gives you the best HDR setting. Simple.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 HRD Fix vid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79b592b711e16/switch-2-hrd-fix-vid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>However! TV sets <em>without HGiG</em> have an issue. With the setting turned on, the test performs as it should, but turned off it makes the test perform incorrectly, so you max out <em>way</em> above the recommended nits whilst attempting to calibrate HDR. Hence, the washed-out image quality.</p>
<p>The video mentions that there are also a huge number of increments to the adjustments with Nintendo's HDR configuration (you can click a whole lot of times with very little difference to the image), which makes the process feel more granular and ineffective. They compare this functionality to Xbox and PlayStation, which have fewer steps to toggle through on their HDR setting screen, and are therefore more readable and easier to adjust.</p>
<p>HDTVTest also discusses Switch 2's "suboptimal default paper white settings," which the video says are off out of the box and tied into HDR settings in a strange way. There's a <em>very detailed</em> breakdown of all of this in the vid so do make sure to check it all out, it's well worth the 10 minutes it takes.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to DaGoldenBoo for flagging this. Have you found the HDR washed out on your TV set whilst playing Switch 2 in docked mode? Has this video helped fix it? Make sure to let us know.</em><em><br></em></p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-reaches-10m-sales-still-no-pc-port.1220409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>has reached a brand new sales milestone, but unfortunately, it looks like there's still no PC port on the horizon.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrashBandicoot/status/1934657226846724255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the publisher says that the game has sold ten million units around the world, which naturally includes both physical and digital shipments. It also accounts for all three platforms on which the game is available.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks as though Activision's appreciation for the game starts and ends with its sales figures; there's no accompanying announcement of a PC version for the game, nor is there any word of whether performance improvements will be implemented for newer-gen consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-sales-10m-race.jpg?itok=6LasRSaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-sales-10m-race.jpg?itok=wOhWQFGA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>has reached a new sales milestone, but it has not reached PC.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>is, it's a remake-slash-remaster of the classic 1999 kart racer, often considered to be one of the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series' biggest rivals.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2018-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-revealed-updated" rel="nofollow">during the 2018 Game Awards</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>is somewhere between a remake and a remaster; it includes a full visual overhaul for the game, as well as tweaks to its gameplay, but otherwise, it hews pretty faithfully to the original&nbsp;<em>CTR</em>.</p>

<p>As well as all of the tracks from the original game,&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>also includes extra tracks and characters from sequels&nbsp;<em>Crash Nitro Kart&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Crash Tag Team Racing</i>. Of course, since we can't have all nice things all the time, it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racings-second-grand-prix-brings-microtransactions-despite-past-promises" rel="nofollow">came complete with microtransactions</a>.</p>

<p>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/there-wont-be-another-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-update-beenox-says" rel="nofollow">came to an end in late 2020</a>, meaning no new tracks or characters have been added since then. It seems that Activision is content to allow&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>to remain in its current state, and also for PC players to miss out on it entirely.</p>

Maybe it’s unfair, but we’ve come to expect Nintendo to consistently amaze us with either how its consoles work or the games you can play with them. In this case, it still feels like a Switch. Only better. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685505/nintendo-says-your-bad-switch-2-battery-life-might-be-a-bug">not universally better, either</a>.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, now that a number of folks on our team have spent some real time with the Switch 2, it’s time to talk about how we feel about this new console. First, <em>The Verge</em>’s Andrew Webster joins the show to talk through his review, from the controllers to the design to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">the game-changing games</a> here and yet to come. Then, <em>The Verge</em>’s Ash Parrish tells us about her experiences traveling with the Switch 2, how her experience has compared to her first demos of the device, and the games she’s been playing so far. Then we pivot a bit, and talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">the Xbox Ally X</a> and Microsoft’s own vision for handheld gaming.</p><p>Finally, <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister helps us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">the state of consoles</a>. Everything in gaming seems more expensive than ever, and more expensive all the time; is it time for the console business to change?</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But today, it's getting another overhaul with Vibrant Visuals, the new cosmetic refresh for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Vibrant Visuals will eventually roll out for Minecraft: Java Edition in the future. In the meantime, the newest update, Chase the Skies, is going live today on all platforms. </p><p>Chase the Skies allows players to find a dried ghast in the Nether and revive it by placing it in water. When the ghast is restored, it can be nurtured and cared for until it becomes a happy ghast. At that point, players can ride their happy ghasts into the Overworld skies and go exploring, as seen in the trailer below. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPWdMDZWM4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zPWdMDZWM4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of the Chase the Skies update, there's a new Locator bar that can help players find their friends in multiplayer. Amos Roddy has also composed six new music tracks--Lilypad, Below and Above, O's Piano, Broken Clocks, Fireflies, and a new version of Tears. These tracks will play in every Overworld biome, but the only way players can get Tears is if it's "looted by a ghast after a non-conventional defeat."</p><p>Players will also be given the ability to craft their own saddles, which means they never have to go searching for pre-made saddles again. </p><p>In other Minecraft news, the game recently unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-and-mlb-team-up-for-baseball-themed-fan-caves/1100-6532003/" data-ref-id="1100-6532003">its baseball-themed fan caves</a> in partnership with Major League Baseball. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecraft Movie</a>--one of this year's biggest hits with just over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-is-the-biggest-hollywood-movie-of-the-year-with-over-800-million/1100-6531157/" data-ref-id="1100-6531157">$800 million worldwide</a>--is slated to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-a-minecraft-movie-comes-to-max/1100-6532435/" data-ref-id="1100-6532435">its streaming debut on Max</a> on June 20, followed by its HBO premiere on June 21.</p>

                <p>The cast of Critical Role has been linked to Dungeons &amp; Dragons from the very beginning of the hit streaming series. Now, two Dungeons &amp; Dragons veterans are joining Critical Role's publishing house, Darrington Press, to work on new game concepts and potentially on additions to the company's recently released Daggerheart game.</p><p>Darrington Press <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared the announcement</a> that Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford--two of the key designers behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition--have signed on as Creative Director and Game Director, respectively. Perkins was at D&amp;D parent company Wizards of the Coast for 28 years, while Crawford had an 18-year run there.</p><p>"Storytelling has always been at the heart of everything I do, and joining Darrington Press feels a bit like coming home," said Perkins in a statement. "I've loved being a part of the extended Critical Role family as a regular guest over the years and I'm beyond excited to help create new worlds full of adventure."</p><p>"I've always believed that great games invite everyone to the table, and that’s exactly what excites me about joining Darrington Press," added Crawford. "This team is passionate, wildly creative, and committed to building welcoming, connected, amazing story-driven experiences--I can't wait to expand on what Critical Role has already created to develop some really fun and unique games."</p><p>Critical Role began in 2015 when a group of voice actors began livestreaming their Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. The series proved to be so popular that Critical Role has expanded into its own standalone media empire, with The Legend of Vox Machina animated series on Prime Video and a second series, Mighty Nein, coming in the future. Wizards of the Coast has also released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-reveals-new-critical-role-book-call-of-the-netherdeep/1100-6496983/" data-ref-id="1100-6496983">official Critical Role/Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign books</a>. In the spirit of that collaboration, the official D&amp;D social media accounts congratulated Crawford and Perkins for their new jobs.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:zw55qqojhklbydnc66gzg2bt/app.bsky.feed.post/3lrqh6lyth22l" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihn6yfl4g65h7fxuhuk3daovge5ajywe4glkeslftl6e3iq5nj454" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Now that the kobold is out of the bag...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/end-of-an-era-nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-unknown-party-after-24-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nexus Mods has new ownership after 24 years under the stewardship of website founder Dark0ne.</p>
<p>Nexus Mods stands as the largest hub for video game mods for PC users, with a library of 716,500 mods across 3,768 games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">In an official blog post</a> Dark0ne, who founded Nexus Mods back in 2001, explained what will change as well as why he decided to step away from the modding giant, linking "stress-related health issues" with his ownership.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our video on some of the best Oblivion mods you can't live without.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_51PIwazz0s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole," wrote Dark0ne. "So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve."</p>
<p>In a section titled "What Changes Now?" Dark0ne stated not much will differ for users, and introduced new owners Victor, Marinus, and Nikolai as the trio who'll be steering the ship going forward. The blog only links to their Nexus Mods accounts page, rather than any information on previous business experience.</p>
<p>This post led some users to dig in a little further. RandomlyRandom67 on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-site-has-been-sold.1219452/page-2#post-141553527">ResetEra</a> did some digging and found the Linkedin profiles of several Danes who share the names of those mentioned in the blog post. This group works at <a href="https://www.wearechosen.io/">a growth-focused gaming company called Chosen</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinus-elgaard/?originalSubdomain=dk]">On Marinus Elgaard's Linkedin page</a>, he wrote "Working closely with teams at NexusMods and beyond to build meaningful, sustainable experiences" under his experience history at Chosen</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chosen-gaming/people/">Chosen's Linkedin page</a>,  four staff named Victor, Marinus, Nikolai, and Nikolaj can be found, further confirmation that Chosen is the company seemingly now in charge of Nexus Mods' future.</p>
<p>This has worried Nexus Mod users, not only due to the growth-focused mission statement at the heart of Chosen, but prior statements from Chosen's Victor Folmann <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_gaming-startup-monetization-cheat-sheet-activity-7254843104778743824-072i/">on monetisation</a>. This LinkedIn post champions the merits of in-app purchases, sponsorship, and more.</p>
<p>On an attached monetisation "cheat sheet" in that same post, a play-to-earn monetisation model is listed as an approach, which spooked some users. However Victor, in response to a comment on the monetisation post stating, "If you add <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> or crypto to Nexus, you'll kill the culture and community", replied "100 percent agree - not happening".</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, that fourth name on Chosen's Linkedin page is especially interesting. Nikolaj is none other than Nikolaj Nyholm! One of the stars of the Danish Dragon's Den, and founder of Danish esports team Astralis, best known for its Counter Strike team. Astralis isn't doing especially hot right now, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/41552/media-astralis-exploring-sale-of-organization-and-cs-division">and is reportedly looking for buyers and investors</a>. Nyholm's involvement in Chosen is one of a founder and investor,  as he puts the world of esports in his back pocket. The one without any money in it.</p>
<p>So it's all a little doom and gloom right now in the world of modding. Concerns stem from the involvement of a growth-focused company, involvement which could lead to changes that impact the users of gaming's biggest mod platform, in spite of Dark0ne's sentiment in his farewell post. The ball is in Chosen's court, to keep the website on the straight and narrow, aligned with the legacy of Nexus Mods, or ultimately prove the critics right.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdd782dba12d3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're anything like us, then chances are you've been handling your Switch 2 like it's a ticking timebomb. There's nothing quite as soul-crushing as when a new piece of tech gets a nasty dent on the casing or a horrible scratch on the screen. It feels like the end of the world.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, reports are starting to emerge that the screen is proving to be particularly susceptible to scratches, with a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spintherism/">Spintherism</a> gathering plenty of comments from users stating that their own consoles are becoming all scratched up.</p>
<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTrueBrawler2001/">TheTrueBrawler2001</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yep, my Switch 2 got scratched from the dock. I've confirmed with my retailer that I can trade it in for a new one once they receive more inventory, but I'm out of luck until then. Already purchased a screen protector in anticipation. If I get a new Switch 2 before it arrives, then I'm not even opening the Switch 2 box until then so I can put it on immediately and protect the new screen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even our own lovely video producer Felix has confirmed that his Switch 2 has received a fair few light scratches since launch. The general consensus seems to be that, like the Switch OLED before it, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2s-screen-comes-with-a-pre-applied-film-layer-dont-peel-it-off">actually the protective plastic film getting all scratched up</a>, not the screen itself.</p>
<p>That would be fine – reassuring, even – but Nintendo has explicitly stated that users should not remove the protective film in order to prevent shards of glass flying about in the event of a severe breakage. So with that in mind, yes, the screen is effectively getting all scratched up, even though it <em>technically</em> isn't.</p>
<p>Touch wood, this writer hasn't experienced anything of the sort yet (<em>though I do also have an extra screen protector applied, just in case</em>), but we'd now like to hand it over to you. Has your Switch 2's screen gathered any nasty scratches yet?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> just got a fresh patch, and it's come with a free cape (not a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-review-bomb-cape-comment-region-locking-lifted">review bomb cape</a>, mind you) that folks who took part in the battle for Super Earth can wear to prove they played a part in the victory. Stick it on your back, and maybe think about showing it off in the glitzy glow of the spotlights the patch adds to Leviathans.</p>
<p>Seriously, I promise doing that last bit won't precede the flying squid things immediately zapping you to death. Ok, maybe it will.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a look through the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/580514905803724132?l=english">Patch 01.003.103</a>, Arrowhead have outlined that the Battle for Super Earth commemorative cape will be dished out to everyone who's logged into the game at some point in the past 60 days and played between May 13th and June 2nd. It's dubbed "Protector of the Heart", and looks pretty swanky provided you're into rocking a big white outline of a planet, accompanied by some gold flourishes.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the patch, the most noteworthy tweak looks to be the addition of spotlights to Leviathans alongside a reduction of their sight range, in order to give players a bit more notice they they're in the firing line. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ldiomm/new_leviathan_spotlights/">this Reddit post</a> demonstrates, those who don't heed the signal to dive out of the way get to stand bathed in light for a few seconds before being death rayed into the great Fascist afterlife.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED</p><p>A cape has been issued commemorating the defense of Super Earth from hostile, evil, and threateningly unknowable alien forces.

<p>Why not take advantage and whip out an inspirational emote so the moment of your death is immortalised in the rest of your squad's minds forever? Sure, John got instakilled by a sneaky squid snipe, they'll recall to their grandkids, but he died miming the tipping of an imaginary cowboy hat.</p>
<p>The other enemy tweak is an increase to the health of Mega Shrieker nests in order to make sure you've got to be more resourceful to crush the bugs. The patch also delivers a bunch of bug fixes and tweaks, including a bunch to the Warrant pistol from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">Force of Law warbond</a> and some that ensure the Borderline Justice warbond armours match their stats.</p>
<p>Arrowhead's even made sure planting the Super Earth flag via the One True Flag stratagem "would cause objective items to clip through the ground".</p>
<p>The game's latest major order, a fight against some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">urban Terminid invasions</a>, is set to end today. So, we'll have to see where the caped-up defenders of Super Earth are sent next.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amazon Prime subscribers can grab several more great games right now as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-9-free-games-in-june/1100-6531806/">Prime Gaming program</a>. In the build-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-amazon-prime-day-2025-sale/1100-6532476/">Prime Day 2025</a>--which starts on July 8 and runs through July 11--six more games are being added and they'll all be available to download starting at <strong>9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on June 17</strong>. As usual, these games will be yours to keep once you claim them, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> right now to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it currently.</p><h2>Available now</h2><ul><li>Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Tomb Raider I-III Starring Lara Croft (GOG)</li><li>Saints Row 2 (GOG)</li><li>Saints Row 4: Re-Elected (GOG)</li><li>Toem (GOG)</li><li>Star Wars: Rebellion (GOG)</li></ul><p>As for the games, there's a fun selection of titles that'll appeal to nostalgic gamers. Tomb Raider I-III Starring Lara Croft is a big highlight here, as you're getting a trilogy of classic games starring the intrepid explorer. Each one has also been graphically updated, but you can switch back to the classic blocky look of those games if you want to play them in their original state. On top of the three games, you're also getting all of the DLC that was released for them.</p><p>Fans of crime and open-world adventures can also claim two Saints Row games. Saints Row 2 helped define the identity of the series as an over-the-top sandbox to cause chaos in, and Saints Row 4 dialed the absurdity up to 11 with a tale of Oval Office politics and an alien invasion. Strategy fans can grab Star Wars: Rebellion and see if they have what it takes to dominate the galaxy as either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. For the fantasy fans out there, Dungeon of the Endless is a fun combo of roguelike gameplay and dungeon-defense ideas.</p><p>Lastly, Toem is a superb indie adventure full of beautiful art, quirky characters, and gameplay that revolves around photography. These bonus games join the other titles that are currently available through Prime Gaming, as you can also pick up Mordheim: City of the Damned, The Abandoned Planet, Station to Station, and Death Squared right now. Later in the month, more games like Dark Envoy and Thief: Deadly Shadows will also be added.</p>

            <p>Nintendo emailed a correction round to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> users yesterday after providing the wrong details on how to unlock <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Mirror Mode.</p>
<p>The email, a thank you to players of the Switch 2 launch game, included tips on how to play, as well as instructions for more experienced players to unlock the iconic mode.</p>
<p>In a follow-up email, Nintendo then apologised for providing incorrect instructions. Yes, the method to unlock Mirror Mode is so obtuse even Nintendo itself got it wrong.</p>

<p>"Nintendo's newsletter, sent to you on 12/06/2025, contained an error regarding the criteria required to unlock Mirror mode in Mario Kart World," the email read. "The information shared was incomplete, and additional steps are required before the mode can be accessed."</p>

<p>As per Nintendo's email, Mirror Mode can be unlocked in the following way:</p>
<p>"Discover a new way to race! In Free Roam, you'll need ten ? Panels, Peach Medallions and successful P Switch missions, plus every 150cc Cup and Rally completed to unlock this."</p>

			<p>At some point during development, Hideo Kojima made some changes to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach because the game was doing too well during playtests and wasn't polarizing enough, according to the game's co-composer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, French composer Woodkid talked about working with Hideo Kojima on the game and how challenging it was to write music that changes in real time while playing, and how difficult it was to put together the eclectic mix of musical genres the game's soundtrack features. When asked, at the end of the interview, about something essential the composer learned working on the game, Woodkid mentioned how, one day, Hideo Kojima confirmed his intention of making changes to the game because it was being too well-received in play tests. These changes, which reportedly include some script changes and the way some important events play out, were meant to make the game more polarizing, trigger more emotions and ensure people would love the game after initially disliking it, as this is how something gets loved for real, Kojima-san reportedly said.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about Hideo Kojima not being too happy with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach's positive reception during play tests. <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Last month</a>, the legendary game creator commented on the matter with Edge Magazine, saying that he wished the game would be more controversial, as he isn't interested in developing games with mass market appeal. To see if the game will indeed be less controversial than its predecessor, we won't have to wait long, as it will launch on PlayStation 5 next week, on June 26th.</p>
