            <p>No, I'm not busy. Ignore the very famous actor acting moody in the corner, he'll be quiet if you pay him no mind. Also, do like I am and just pretend my holo-phone doesn't have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/extending-cyberpunk-2077s-pre-heist-rise-through-the-ranks-would-risk-a-meandering-unfocused-experience-argues-cyberpunk-2-director">a million urgent messages</a> about some relic sitting in its inbox. Just sit here on the sofa, in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> flat, and watch as the big flying thing with Dogtown's military dictator's face on it floats between my futuristic kitchen and lounge, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As someone who digs chilling in Cyberpunk, prolific modder Deceptious' latest creation is about the best late new year present I could have asked for. Dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/26674">Apartment Toys</a>', it takes a bunch of flying craft used by Night City's various factions - from Militch choppers to Arasaka AVs - and shrinks them down to serve as interactive models which can fly around a bunch of V's flats.</p>
<p>It grew out of the model Trauma Team AV the base game sticks in V's default flat for beating the Trauma Drama arcade game's high score and the modder's desire to have a <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/2002256774007521640">Christmas-themed SleighV</a> fly around each of the game's more specious abodes. Not one of those rare creations that'll turn your playthrough of a game upside down, but I think it's a neat little addition all the same.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Almost done... going all out, &amp; making sure to justify this as a whole new mod I publish tomorrow!🆕<br>Fixed the landing pad (it had some jank)<br>Added decals + lighting variants to match the chosen AV<br>Applied it all to the apartments (after testing in Corpo)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Modding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Modding</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyberpunk2077?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cyberpunk2077</a> <a href="https://t.co/h3HQ7OqSHR">pic.twitter.com/h3HQ7OqSHR</a></p>— Deceptious - Phil (@DeceptiousPhil) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/2008023548301058422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Specifically, I think the fact one of the 13 different craft options its currently boasts is the converted ship which flies around over Dogtown reminding you who's boss via some spotlights and an intimidating  passport snap of the person running the district. Or, as I prefer to call it, the Barghest blimp. Now, with a simple button press, it can patrol the unruly streets of your posh corporate plaza digs.</p><p>No more worries about the clutter you've amassed getting any bright ideas about overthrowing tyrants. Kurt's floaty face is on the case, gently jetting around to make sure everything's in order. Make sure you salute him every time he completes one of his laps. Or, delve into the mod's settings and toggle the looping flight option on. Then he'll patrol until the synthetic cows come home.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this mod a go, you'll need a small pile of typical Cybermodding frameworks. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107">Cyber Engine Tweaks</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198?tab=description">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518?tab=description">Native Settings UI</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious Quest Core</a>. The Phantom Liberty DLC's also a must-have. Also, for more ways to waste time not thinking about your impending doom in Cyberpunk, another modder created the means for it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">serve you Night City lingo-heavy word puzzles</a> last year.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-forerunner-165-hits-record-low-as-a-running-smartwatch-alternative-to-apple-watch-perfect-for-your-new-years-fitness-goals-2000656782</link>
            <guid>1398403</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="487">Data plays a crucial role in improving your performance as an athlete. To enhance your speed, boost your endurance, and maintain a consistent training routine, investing in a top-notch running watch is key. Whether you’re preparing for a marathon, gearing up for a local 5K, or simply running a couple times a week, having a reliable running watch is essential to measuring your efforts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Right now, Amazon is offering a limited-time discount on the Garmin Forerunner 165, slashing its price by $50—down to just $200.</a></p>
<p data-start="489" data-end="801">The Garmin Forerunner 165 is tailored for individuals leading active lifestyles and those focused on fitness. It boasts a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen that offers crystal-clear visibility, whether you’re running in direct sunlight or during nighttime.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="803" data-end="830">Your Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="832" data-end="1301">The Garmin Forerunner 165’s built-in GPS lets you track your running routes and it provides accurate data on your distance, pace, and other essential metrics. The watch also includes wrist-based heart rate monitoring, making it perfect for athletes who train according to specific heart rate zones. With over 25 pre-loaded activity profiles, it supports a broad range of sports, including running, HIIT, cycling, strength training, and more.</p>
<p data-start="1303" data-end="1670">In addition to its advanced tracking capabilities, the Garmin Forerunner 165 can serve as a personal fitness coach. Using the Garmin Connect app, you can access free adaptive training plans from expert coaches, which can be synced directly to your watch. This takes the guesswork out of your training, ensuring a more efficient approach to improving your performance.</p>
<p data-start="1672" data-end="2095">Beyond workouts, the Garmin Forerunner 165 continues to monitor your overall health throughout the rest of your day. It keeps track of your heart rate, both during physical activities and while at rest. A favorite of mine is the Body Battery score, which evaluates your energy levels based on factors like heart rate and activity. This helps you identify the optimal times to train or rest, ensuring you stay at your peak performance.</p>


<p data-start="2097" data-end="2447">Battery life is impressive on the Forerunner 165. With GPS active, the watch can last up to 19 hours, which is perfect for long runs. When GPS isn’t in use, the battery can last for up to 11 days. Someone who is running multiple times a week will likely find themselves only need to charge the watch once a week. This makes it far superior to other smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch, which typically require daily charging.</p>
<p data-start="2449" data-end="2827">The Garmin Forerunner 165 also offers smart features similar to those found on more expensive smartwatches. When connected to a compatible smartphone, the watch allows you to receive notifications for emails, texts, and alerts directly on your wrist. This means you can keep your phone tucked away while staying connected and informed during your workouts or throughout the day.</p>
<p data-start="2829" data-end="3118" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Typically priced at $250, it’s currently available for just $200 with a 20% discount</a>. You can select between two stylish band colors: black or white, depending on your preference.</p>

<p>Amazon has revealed a wave of new casting announcements for its upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series, expanding the roster around Sophie Turner, who was previously confirmed to play the iconic Lara Croft.</p>



<p>First launched in 1996, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-players-will-require-no-homework-before-jumping-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a> has become one of gaming’s most recognisable franchises, spawning multiple film adaptations and animated projects over the years. Now, Amazon is preparing its own take on Lara Croft’s globe-trotting adventures, with casting details beginning to shed light on the shape of the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-sigourney-weaver-jason-isaacs-amp-more-cast-for-amazon-s-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, &amp; More Cast For Amazon’s Tomb Raider Series</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a star-studded cast. Image by Amazon.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was exclusively revealed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q5jcp0/reddit_exclusive_new_cast_and_characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider subreddit</a> that eleven new cast members had joined the roster for Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series.

Other additions include museum curators, government officials, rival raiders, and Lara’s personal pilot, helping to flesh out the wider world around the adventurer. </p>



<p>The full list of actors and their associated characters is available in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Actor Name</th><th data-align="center">Character Name</th><th data-align="center">Character Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Jack Bannon</td><td data-align="center">Gerry</td><td data-align="center">Gerry is Lara’s personal pilot and snack collector.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">John Heffernan</td><td data-align="center">David</td><td data-align="center">David is an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara’s unusual world.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Celia Imrie</td><td data-align="center">Francine</td><td data-align="center">Francine is the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paterson Joseph</td><td data-align="center">Thomas Warner</td><td data-align="center">Thomas Warner is a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sashu Luss</td><td data-align="center">Sasha</td><td data-align="center">Sasha is a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara’s.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Juliette Motamed</td><td data-align="center">Georgia</td><td data-align="center">Georgia is a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the ‘proper’ preservation of history.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sigourney Weaver</td><td data-align="center">Evelyn Wallis</td><td data-align="center">A mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara’s talents.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">August Wittgenstein</td><td data-align="center">Lukas</td><td data-align="center">Lukas is an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO revealed a brand new platform called SMART Play at CES 2026, which brings more life to each creation. </p>



<p>LEGO is known to provide sets for a variety of franchises, including gaming and other entertainment media. In recent times, we have seen the company unveil sets for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-game-boy-set-releasing-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Game Boy</a> as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a>. However, their latest reveal is not a new set, but a platform that will change the way all other sets work.</p>











<p>Revealed in a new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/december/lego-smart-play-announcement?locale=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, LEGO SMART Play is a new platform that features “more than twenty patented world-firsts within its technology.” The centre’s focus is the LEGO SMART Brick, which features a custom-made chip that enables responsive physical play. The SMART Brick comes with technologies like sensors, accelerometers, light sensing, and a sound sensor, along with a miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser. It also features easy wireless charging. </p>



<p>The LEGO SMART Tags and LEGO SMART Minifigures, on the other hand, work in tandem with the SMART Bricks, and they respond to the players’ actions with appropriate sounds and behaviours. LEGO SMART Play will launch on March 1, 2026, and the first SMART Play-enabled sets will be LEGO Star Wars sets. </p>

Players can expect interactive features such as laser shooting, engine, refueling, and repair sounds &amp; lights.  </li>



<li>The second one is LEGO Star Wars SMART Play Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter, a 473-piece set featuring SMART Minifigures of Darth Vader and a Rebel Fleet Trooper. The SMART Play features will bring “the roar of the twin ion engines comes to life.”</li>

It’s a solution to the reality of modern gaming, where managing apps, info, and devices is just as critical as performance. This level of control has never existed in a single device before, and only CORSAIR could bring the future of input to market now.”</strong></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-brings-gameplay-maturity-to-suda51s-signature-madness</link>
            <guid>1398385</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t always describe Goichi Suda and Grasshopper Manufacture’s games, but you know them when you see them. Examples like Let It Die and Lollipop Chainsaw might not resemble each other on paper, but spend any length of time with them and their specific high energy, off-the-wall style, brash tone, and script that's just wall-to-wall one-liners and you'll see that could really only ever come from one place. Just a few minutes with their latest slasher, Romeo Is a Dead Man, and yeah the boys are definitely back in town. But after playing the first two chapters, the latest mad science experiment of an action game helmed by Suda51, it clearly takes some big steps forward in art design and presentation that really raises the “Wow I didn’t see that coming” bar. Even the action, though not revolutionary, feels like a real commitment has been made to evolve the studio’s image from “crazy fun games to watch clips from” to “crazy fun games to spend countless hours with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of Grasshopper-style things that are to be expected in Romeo Is a Dead Man: relentless absurdist humor, gore galore, killing the past, etc. But the signature erratic tone set as far back as Killer7 feels turned up to 11 here. The breakneck pace at which exposition gets sort of vomited at you, scenes change from focused narration to chaotic combat, and more is pretty intense. It’s not necessarily hard to follow, but more than once in my two or so hours with the game did I have to take a minute or two to simply digest what the hell was going on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Romeo Is a Dead Man - January 2026 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the titular Romeo, who does have himself a Juliet, but the only way this game showed any resemblance to your favorite play from high school is that both of them die. Romeo is a deputy sheriff who gets his face ripped off by an interdimensional zombie ghoul and is transformed into a sort of Space Sheriff Gavan-style superhero that keeps him in a state of undeath and is drafted in to a sort of space time division of the FBI to hunt the sort of monsters that tried to kill him. Juliet, who arrived in Romeo’s little Appalachian town through mysterious circumstances, is actually some kind of extradimensional being who seems to keep popping up in people’s dimensions and mucking up the place, and is one of Romeo’s first targets. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Romeo Is a Dead Man’s story might be among the most ridiculous and far flung of Suda and Co.’s gameography, but it holds tightly to its fourth wall-breaking sense of humor and over the top characters that define the studio.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the simple version, completely glossing over things like the fact that the guy who saved Romeo is allegedly his time-traveling grandfather – who is also killed by face eaters but now just lives in a patch on Romeo’s jacket, for starters. Romeo Is a Dead Man’s story might be among the most ridiculous and far flung of Suda and Co.’s gameography, but it holds tightly to its fourth wall-breaking sense of humor and over the top characters that define the studio. It’s relatively easy to follow, and told in such a way to purposefully cast doubt on if what you’re attempting to decipher is even real. But it is engaging, if not always well-written or acted. And even then, it's told through a collage of mixed media that really kept me enthralled.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening sequence is a flyover of a tilt-shifted, handmade diorama. From there, we transition into a standard cutscene rendered in full 3D as one would expect, and the next scene might be a vividly detailed comic strip. Inside levels, small televisions appear with pixelated animations on them that serve as portals transporting you to spaces that look more like the Street Fighter training room with a stock jungle image in the background. When teleporting to your FBI HQ – a ship called The Last Night – you navigate it like a top-down 32-bit Sega Genesis-style RPG. When you die, the “game over” screen is an FMV of a human-like prosthetic face getting melted off. It’s all jarring, and frankly, pretty awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grasshopper games have a bit of a reputation for having stories and presentation given texture through tons of references to pop culture, classic literature, and raucous music, but not having the same sort of depth when it comes time to beat ass, the misunderstood Killer Is Dead excluded. Romeo Is a Dead Man isn’t Devil May Cry, but it has a lot of layered systems that create a combat experience that I really came to like quite a bit. You have basic light and heavy attacks with their own attack strings that can be stopped early but not canceled out with a dodge or something like that, so every swing is a commitment. When surrounded by enemies, even the simple cannon fodder basic zombies, it can be tough to make it out unscathed since these attacks don't stun enemies very reliably, meaning they're often free to slap as you slap them. I spent a lot of my time trying to stay outside of mobs, picking away at the edges with melee attacks or shots with guns at range and avoiding getting overwhelmed until I built enough of my blood meter through my attacks to use a special Bloody Summer attack for big damage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This pretty simple loop was a bit of a let down for me early on, as Chapter 1 lacked attack and enemy variety, or really any challenge or pushback at all. And if I would have stopped my time after slaying the pretty straightforward end-level boss, a towering giant spawned after a Juliet clone ripped off her own head and threw it into a campfire, I would have missed the metric ton of new stuff that drops right after that gives Romeo so many more toys to work with.  After flying back to HQ to report a job well done, I could buy more and different weapons – all which add their own sort of approach to regular combat – and could be swapped between in the field. I don’t think the melee weapons forced me to change my playstyle in the way a heavy greatsword, set of robot gauntlets, and spear that split into dual blades should, but the ranged weapons did. The pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, and machine gun all forced me to work around their strengths way differently, if I was going to choose to lean on them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Romeo is a Dead Man’s weirdest and best feature, though, are bastards – zombies that you can grow like plants that have special abilities that you can equip to use in battle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Romeo is a Dead Man’s weirdest and best feature, though, are bastards – zombies that you can grow like plants that have special abilities that you can equip to use in battle, like one that spits poison or one that blows itself up on enemies. This gives you so many more ways to control crowds and keep your offense effective against a cohort of bad guys that also grow more deadly. Basic foes with guns (at least on the 3 out of 4 difficulty I was playing on) provided a significant jump in danger when they repeatedly shot at me while being tucked behind hordes of zombies. Mix that with the spicier sort of mutants that ram you with their giant tomato heads or scorpion-shaped bomb lobbers that leave toxic trails, and any given scenario could become a death trap. Even the second boss, a giant mutant head you fight between two floors of a mall food court, is a huge step up in quality from the first.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Romeo Is a Dead Man - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty old-school action game. There aren’t a lot of nuanced mechanics like dodges cancels. There's not even a parry or a block – at least in the beginning. But I enjoyed the relatively simple push and pull of each stage with the systems that exist quite a lot, even if the camera became a monster on its own. With everything properly in frame things still get very busy on screen very quickly, mostly due to the truly egregious levels of blood and particle effects that come off of enemies as you slash them up. Mix that with the text bubbles that pop up from characters trying to give you some unvoiced dialogue usually fight in the middle of combat and it can be hard to focus on the task at hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes despite itself, Romeo Is a Dead Man is shaping up to be a frantic action romp worthy of the Grasshopper Manufacture pedigree. Its somewhat traditional action mechanics don’t really test your reflexes and make an underwhelming first impression, but does pay off patience when rewarding good positioning and smart use of your bastard skills to get a leg up on the more eccentric enemies past the first chapter. It’s crazy throughout, using strong humor and marvelous art direction at a breakneck speed to make its truly bonkers space-traveling love story one worth patiently waiting until February 16 for.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-brings-gameplay-maturity-to-suda51s-signature-madness]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1398382</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The screen they play on may be small, but for competitors in the 2025 PUBG MOBILE Global Championship (PMGC), the tournament is anything but. Between 12-14 December, 16 teams from all around the world gathered in Thailand to give it their all on a giant stage in front of a legion of cheering fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This major global competition is the conclusion of more than a year of training and face-offs for these professional teams, all leading towards the prestigious event in the circuit. In qualifying for this ultimate trial, teams went head-to-head once more to take the 2025 PMGC title and the lion’s share of $3m — one of the largest prize pools in esports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn’t all, the tournament expanded beyond the venue’s walls, with PUBG MOBILE activations popping up around Bangkok. IGN was on the ground to witness the grand finals, soak up the festival-like atmosphere, and learn more about how PUBG MOBILE Esports is growing in 2026.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/bambam-4-1767612303389.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Thai singer Bam Bam performed in the opening ceremony </figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>DROPPING INTO BANGKOK</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Finals of 2025 PMGC may have taken place on the 5th floor of the luxurious Siam Paragon shopping mall, but the celebrations extended far and wide. Both inside and outside the venue, PUBG MOBILE pop-ups, collaborations, and installations brought a vibrant energy to proceedings, providing fans and players who travelled from across the globe with unique experiences, in addition to the spectacle of the Grand Finals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On our first day, after entering past the plane-themed check-in desk, we found ourselves in the PUBG United Fan Zone, an area seemingly filled with as many activities as there were attendees. This marked a pivotal moment for PUBG MOBILE, as it collaborated with PUBG for the first time ever to celebrate a long-standing history of competition and sportsmanship conveyed through the 2025 PMGC and PUBG Global Championship 2025 (PGC). This certainly showed, as lining the walls of the Fan Zone were interactive experiences ranging from a human claw machine, glambot, PUBG café, Frosty Barbershop (where I got a PUBG MOBILE-themed temporary tattoo), Metro Royale battle experience, and a World of Wonder Challenge area where players could get hands on with curated UGC experiences.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG United Fanzone</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the centre of the Fan Zone, the PUBG MOBILE Air Drop Stage hosted multiple performances from bands (Thai artists Paper Planes were a particular highlight, getting the crowd jumping and singing along with their pop-punk anthems), as well as several Muay Thai fights – truly ‘kicking’ things off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the opening ceremony and 2026 PUBG MOBILE Esports announcements (more on that later), we swung by the PDP Creative Zone, home to a colossal PUBG MOBILE helmet that had been decorated by selected PDP artists and designers during the event. As if that wasn’t enough, the approach to the stage also featured pop-ups collaborations with Porsche and Thai bakery brand famous for its adorable mascot character, Butterbear.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/butterbear-1-1767612397373.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Butterbear mascot on stage with James Yang, Senior Director of Global esports at Level Infinite</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that was just a selection of what was going on in the venue! Once the first matches of the Grand Finals were finished, it was time for Bangkok to show that PUBG United had arrived in the city. After a quick trip to the Chao Phraya River in a PUBG MOBILE branded Tuk Tuk, we witnessed the PUBG MOBILE drone light show featuring hundreds of drones lighting up the sky. These formed iconic PUBG MOBILE imagery, including ‘Winner Winner Chicken Dinner’, characters dropping into the map, and appropriately, Air Drop crates. Plus, if you kept an eye out on the Chao Phraya River, you could even see the PUBG MOBILE Giant Boat making a splash.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/drone-show-1767690333375.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Drone show lit up the sky by the Chao Phraya River</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>ONE WORLD, TWO CHAMPIONS</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, for the first time ever, both the PUBG MOBILE and PUBG Global Championships came together for a unified global event – PUBG United – a celebration of both games and their communities. The sense of two giants coming together was felt, and illustrated, by the two giant back-to-back stages that hosted the Grand Finals, with gameplay and crucial team standings displayed on the wall-to-wall screens, giving attendees a great view of the action wherever they were sat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/fmvp-1767612595763.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alpha Gaming player Top was crowned MVP for the PMGC 2025</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of giants, PUBG MOBILE’s collaboration with luxury brands took a big step up this year. Building on a successful collaboration campaign between Porsche and PUBG MOBILE, it was announced that Porsche would invigorate the PMGC stage with the prize of a Porsche Cayenne to the MVP player of the 2025 PMGC Grand Finals. For 2025 PMGC MVP ‘TOP’, from team Alpha Gaming, it's likely this softened the blow of coming third place overall.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PMGC Winners - Alpha 7 </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the winners however, another collaboration offered up its own prize, as the collaboration between PUBG MOBILE and renowned luxury fashion house Balenciaga saw the two brands converge their unique identities again, this time with an exclusive designed jacket that only the Champions of the 2025 PUBG MOBILE Global Championship had the honour of wearing and owning. With this, in addition to the glory of being crowned 2025 PMGC Champions and lifting the trophy, team Alpha 7 esports were adorned with exclusive 2025 PMGC Champion jackets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>MOBILE GROWTH</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than 1 billion downloads around the world, and over 50 million daily active users, PUBG MOBILE is one of the most popular mobile games in the world – so it tracks that the game’s esports scene is also hugely popular, and continues to grow. With more than 1 billion downloads around the world, and over 50 million daily active users, PUBG MOBILE is one of the most popular mobile games in the world – so it tracks that the game’s esports scene is also hugely popular, and continues to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This growth and success was exemplified by PUBG MOBILE being awarded Mobile Esports of the Year at the Esports Awards for the second time. It’s no surprise then that at this year’s PMGC, PUBG MOBILE recorded its highest peak viewership in five years, with more than 1.3 million concurrent viewers watching the Grand Finals across the globe. This peak was reached between matches 16-18, in the last few pivotal moments of the competition which saw Alpha 7, ULF Esports, and Alpha Gaming battle it out for the title which was well within reach of all three teams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things for PUBG MOBILE are only set to get even better, and as the new year approaches, a new season of PUBG MOBILE esports events begins, and as was announced by James Yang, Senior Director of Global esports at Level Infinite, the PUBG MOBILE Esports calendar is looking even busier in 2026…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>WHAT’S NEXT FOR PUBG MOBILE ESPORTS IN 2026</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Building on 2025’s PUBG MOBILE’s esports experience, which featured over one-million players from over 180 countries and regions, Yang unveiled a series of updates regarding the future of PUBG MOBILE Esports, including a refreshed competitive structure and a doubling down on support for grassroots and amateur level esports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest shake up coming in 2026 is that instead of following the previous Super League structure, there will be two PMGO tournaments spread across two seasons, expanding qualification routes and increasing the number of opportunities for players of all levels to compete at the top.

Firstly, it will be easier than ever for organisers to create their own competitions, as the registration process for third-parties has been streamlined, and for competitors across the globe, the enhancement of the in-game participation system means they’ll be able to join an esports tournament with just a few clicks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GET INVOLVED</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Bangkok closed out the year with another successful PMGC.

Foster fur-ocious firepower, raising a weapon of mass destruction that gains combat prowess through positive affirmations, cuddles, and a steady diet of seeds. Unravel a warm story filled with good-humored banter, keeping things light in a post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>Unleash destructive havoc against incoming threats to save the nation from collapse. Grab the tiny hamster, point it towards approaching enemies, and watch MOCHI-O obliterate approaching enemy ships with its ever-evolving abilities in tower defense-style combat. </p><p>Outfit MOCHI-O with various weapons and abilities, and feast on bundles of seeds dropped by defeated foes to gain XP. Collect enough seeds to level up MOCHI-O’s base attributes, like firing rate, crit chance, attack range, and cooldown reductions to create a custom playstyle.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As the caretaker’s bond with MOCHI-O increases, so does its firepower! Outside of battle, encourage MOCHI-O with pets, feeding, and decorate its room to create an ideal environment for bonding to unlock upgrades and new weapons.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="MOCHI-O - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvP-rdNyvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/mochi-o-for-pc-launches-january-19]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the first batch of games coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service this January.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> Enhanced Edition and Brews and Bastards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-xbox-game-pass-has-added-two-more-games-as-five-others-get-ready-to-leave-the-service-soon">which are both available to play now</a>, Game Pass subscribers can also look forward to the following games making their way onto the service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomfall</strong> (Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC) – 7th January, now with Game Pass Premium</li>
<li>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 7th January, now with Game Pass Premium</li>

<li><strong>Final Fantasy</strong> – (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) –  8th January, via Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li>

<p>So, what of those games? Well, I know our Ian was very taken with Atomfall, and he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">celebrated being able to bop a chap over the head with a cricket bat as the poor blighter was having a wee against a wall</a>.</p>
<p>"If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">Eurogamer's Atomfall review</a>.</p>
<p>Another favourite, at least with me, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">our Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> was a bit hit and miss for many of us here at Eurogamer. I had a decent enough time with it, others not so much. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the requirements, the studio has announced a partnership with Nvidia for 007 First Light, saying the power of GeForce's latest RTX technologies will allow the team to "deliver a PC experience that matches the level of quality we believe the Bond franchise deserves".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">007 First Light is set to arrive on 27th May</a>. As well as PC, the game will also be available across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox ROG Ally X, Xbox ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">announced that rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in 007 First Light as black market dealer Bawma</a>.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The new year is finally upon us, and with that comes a whole horde of new games to think about — <em>yipee!</em></p>
<p>2026 is already looking pretty stacked, and while January is usually one of the quieter months in the release calendar, there are still a handful of big hitters coming our way over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Here to highlight the cream of the crop are the wonderful Alex and Alana, who you'll find chatting about eight awesome up-and-comers in the video above. There's a bit of everything, from first-party favourites to lesser-known delights. So, grab a beverage and prepare to make those wishlists a little bit longer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where Winds Meet v1.2 Arrives This Month with Large-Scale Battles and the Most Intense ‘Helping Seniors Cross the Street’ Game Mode Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-update-1-2-january-2026-roadmap/</link>
            <guid>1398334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>NetEase Games just unveiled the January 2026 roadmap for <strong>Where Winds Meet,</strong> the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/where-winds-meet-everything-we-know-about-the-wuxia-open-world-action-adventure-rpg/">new open-world, Wuxia action RPG</a> that arrived in November 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-december-2025-roadmap/">After last month's batch of updates introduced a new region for players to explore and new bosses</a>, the roadmap for January is more stacked with new events, story content, and what looks like the most intense version of helping the elderly get to where they need to go with <strong>Elder Express</strong>.</p>



<p>The headline for the January 2026 roadmap is the arrival of Where Winds Meet version 1.2, which introduces several elements to the game, including the Nine Mortal Ways Camp, a new puzzle cave called Mistveil Prison. It also includes the final Kaifeng volume and a new campaign challenge boss called Supreme Freedom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/31.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: NetEase Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The other big addition with v1.2 is the introduction of large-scale multiplayer combat in Guild Battle Preseason. Guild Battles are coordinated efforts that will require you to work with your fellow guild members to secure a victory. If you try to win it solo, you'll do so at your own peril.</p>



<p>As this is NetEase's first introduction of these battles, the Preseason is a short, six-match tournament that is more about letting players try out the new mode so NetEase can see what players like, dislike, and how it can be adapted. "<em>This preseason is crucial for us to gather player feedback and refine the core Guild Battle mechanics</em>," said NetEase Games in a press release. "<em>We encourage all guilds to rally their members, hone their tactics, and prepare for the even more expansive guild content planned in upcoming updates</em>."</p>



<p>While the incoming content for January 2026 has already started to roll in with the new Unbound Solo mode and the new Hero's Realm having arrived on January 4, everything else will arrive this Friday with the version 1.2 update beginning on <strong>January 9, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Including Elder Express, a new game mode that sees you run through the streets with an elderly person on your back, which players can jump in and out of without any prerequisites.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/41.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: NetEase Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In just its first month, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-surpassed-15-million-players-in-its-first-month/">surpassed 15 million players around the world</a>, after already hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/">9 million players before the game even made it to mobile devices</a>. It's been the latest massive launch from NetEase Games, following the studio's hit shooter, Marvel Rivals. </p>



<p>Even though it's still very early in the game's life, its rocket-ship launch makes it seem like NetEase is about to start dominating yet another genre within live service games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">In Wccftech's review,</a> Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> may not be the choppy, stuttering overextender of gratuitous explosi-pixels that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-first-proper-footage-reveals-a-posh-blockbuster-with-bubbles-of-hitman">its big action reveal</a> led us to believe. The official PC system requirements are out, and they’re very reasonable indeed, only asking for old mid-range <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> and merely halfway decent CPUs. Could IO Interactive have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-has-been-delayed-so-hitman-devs-io-can-further-buff-the-bondage">delayed their young Bond adventure to May 27th</a> so as to polish up performance, especially around the more Brosnan-era detonationfests in that footage? Maybe, maybe not. But at least you won’t need John Cleese to build you a machine that can run it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Unusually, the microfilm containing these specs was dropped in our inboxes along with a gushing quote from IOI’s Ulas Karademir about how jolly good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">Nvidia DLSS 4</a> is. Thus, First Light will come with a suite of RTX toggles, including DLSS upscaling and frame generation – with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) for GeForce RTX 50 series card owners. It should, therefore, also work with the newly announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-reveals-dlss-45-with-anti-aliasing-upgrades-and-a-dynamic-if-slightly-mad-6x-frame-gen-mode">DLSS 4.5</a> and its Dynamic MFG mode.</p>
<p>Full specs as follows:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First Light isn’t a lightweight game, claiming an 80GB storage minimum, though other than maybe wanting 32GB of RAM for recommended hardware – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">what, in this economy?</a> – it’s relatively easygoing for a modern action-adventure. The likes of the RTX 3060 Ti and Radeon RX 6700 XT for 1080p/60fps aren’t excessive at all, and that storage requirement doesn’t even specify that it needs to be on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> instead of an old hard drive.</p><p>Perhaps I’m overextrapolating with the idea that lower PC specs mean an absence of performance issues, and ultimately these lists don’t cover the kind of hardware you’d need for maxed-out 1440p, 4K, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide</a> play. But a lower entry level almost always carries into lower requirements on luxury settings too, and it’s encouraging that First Light runs on a version of same Glacier Engine that IOI use for the Hitman games. The most recent of which, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">World of Assassination</a>, runs like water on hardware as simple as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. When it doesn’t have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitman-3-ray-tracing-performance">ray tracing enabled</a>, anyway.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-goes-full-clearance-on-its-laptop-at-78-off-15-3-ideapad-slim-3-drops-to-all-time-low-2000657106</link>
            <guid>1398325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a new laptop today? You’re in luck. Amazon is offering plenty of discounts across a wide range of categories, including laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">One of our favorite discounts is this 78% drop on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which brings its price down to just $440.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving over $1,500 on a machine that is made to handle all your everyday work and entertainment needs like a pro. Even better, if you place your orders today, you will also enjoy free shipping on your purchase, which sweetens the deal even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Made for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>IdeaPad Slim 3 is a lightweight laptop with a basic, yet sleek design. You’re getting a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS display that delivers a stunning 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life. Whether you’re catching up on the last episode of Pluribus or creating a work presentation, expect vivid details and vibrant colors. The narrow bezels offer a larger screen real estate to work on, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals consistent across all lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Right above the screen is a built-in 720p webcam with a privacy shutter for easier video calls. You will be able to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external device. Those who need to type long documents and fill spreadsheets often will also appreciate the full-sized keyboard that features a dedicated numeric keypad. It’s comfortable to use, so you won’t have to deal with sore wrists at the end of a productive day.</p>
<p>Speaking of productivity, the laptop runs on a modest 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H processor with 8 cores and 12 threads. It’s made to handle regular tasks – think browsing, streaming, light office work, studying – without slowing you down. The processor is paired with an 8GB DDR5 SDRAM memory that keeps things running smoothly as you work or play. That said, it’s not designed for heavy workloads, so you won’t exactly be able to work on demanding tasks. But as long as your needs are fairly standard, it should get the job done just fine.</p>



<p>Storage capacity is better than most options in this range. You’re getting a spacious 512GB SSD that can house your entire multimedia library on your PC, and more easily. SSDs also offer much faster boot and load times than their traditional counterparts, so you’ll also be able to launch programs and move files around more efficiently.</p>
<p>Connectivity options are just as impressive. You’ve got WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless connections, plus a wide range of ports including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one power connector.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of waiting, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is receiving a slew of new content in the 3.0 update, releasing alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade of the game.</p>



<p>Six years after it was first released, and four years on from the 2.0 update, Animal Crossing: New Horizons receives the 3<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-switch-2-edition-exact-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.0 update on January 15</a>, bringing new content, new villagers, and more to the game.</p>



<p>For a complete rundown on everything being added in the update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-new-content-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update">All New Content in Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 Update</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New tasks. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-new-amp-returning-villagers">New &amp; Returning Villagers</h3>



<p>Four additional villagers will become available in Animal Crossing: New Horizons with the 3.0 update, although the process to add them to your island requires using an Amiibo, and they cannot be invited to your island without them.</p>



<p>Mineru and Tulin are the two new additions, from the Legends of Zelda Amiibos, while Cece and Viche are returning villagers, available by scanning Splatoon Amiibos.</p>



<p>Without the use of Amiibos, none of the four additional villagers coming to New Horizons in the 3.0 update can be invited to your island.</p>



<h3 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements">Quality-of-Life Improvements</h3>



<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are introduced in the 3.0 update, increasing the maximum amount of available storage to 9,000, along with the ability to place trees, bushes, andd flowers inside storage.</p>



<p>When crafting, you are able to select the number of items in total you want to craft, rather than having to do one at a time, and crafting now pulls materials from storage, meaning you will no longer have to have all the materials required in your pockets.</p>



<p>Finally, when terraforming, movement changes make it easier to build or remove fences, paths, cliffs, and rivers on a single axis, with quick steps in a single direction.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Design time. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-resort-hotel">Resort Hotel</h3>



<p>The biggest gameplay addition in the New Horizons 3.0 update is the Resort Hotel, where players are tasked to design rooms for guests matching a specified theme.  Tourists will visit the island and can be found wandering around, with the ability to invite specific villagers using Amiibo. </p>



<p>Completing requests earns Hotel Tickets, used to claim goods at the souvenir shop run by Grams, and Hotel Tickets are also earned by fulfilling requests for DIY goods, which also increases the hotel’s international brand recognition.</p>



<p>Additionally, the hotel lobby has two mannequins that can be dressed with custom outfits, which both animal and human visitors can borrow to wear.</p>



<h3 id="h-reset-service">Reset Service</h3>



<p>Mr. Resetti’s island Reset Service is added in the 3.0 update, allowing players to easily clear specific areas of the island. When doing so, you can choose for items to be disposed of, or placed into storage.</p>



<p>The Reset Service can also be used to clear planted flowers and custom designs, making it much easier to give your island a new makeover.</p>



<h3 id="h-slumber-islands">Slumber Islands</h3>



<p>Slumber Islands are available in a new dream world, with each player able to create up to three. There is a selection of random layouts, and three varying sizes.</p>



<p>Islands can be fully terraformed and decorated with items from a player’s catalog, while the time of day and weather can also be set. Lloid is available to construct bridges and inclines on demand.</p>



<p>You can also invite other players to join your Slumber Island via multiplayer and work together crafting the island.</p>



<h3 id="h-collaborations">Collaborations</h3>



<p>Several collaborations are added in the New Horizons 3.0 update, bringing a host of new items, decorations, and rare furniture items into the game.</p>



<p>Grams’ souvenir shop stocks rare furniture items as the Hotel’s brand recognition increases, themed on classic Nintendo consoles and retro toys. With an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, players can select and play games on the consoles, with Clu Clu Land, ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Panel de Pon, and F-Zero available.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, LEGO-themed furniture is added to Nook Shopping, and can be purchased when it becomes available. There are also themed items from The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon available when compatible Amiibos are scanned.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> has released its latest Savage-tier raid today, pushing the game's best and brightest to race through this new challenge group content to earn powerful loot and see which region can take it down first. However, for Americans, this is proving difficult due to ongoing DDOS attacks and server outages.</p>
<p>With the release of patch 7.4 last month, players were welcomed back to the game with a bunch of new content to pour over. The Savage difficulty for the Heavyweight raid, which was delayed until after the holiday season, has just come out resulting in the usual rush to see which team can take it down first.</p>
<p>The problem comes from DDOS attacks. American players, obviously present on different servers than like-minded raiders in other regions, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1q5f3a8/3_ddos_attacks_within_30_minutes_on_savage_launch/">are facing a spree of connection issues</a> as the servers are bombarded with digital assaults from nefarious parties. Checking the FF14 server status page, <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/worldstatus/">you can see a sizable portion of America servers under strain</a>.</p>

<p>This has resulted in chaos for the race for world first Heavyweight Savage clears, as American teams are scrambling to contend with these extra hurdles. Players looking to temporarily hop to different servers, such as Oceania's Materia server cluster, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elanortrevelyan.bsky.social/post/3mbqtnxkwgk2i">aren't safe from these attacks either</a>. The only way to dodge such attacks at this time appears to be a full-on server transfer to another region, which would add additional latency to play which top-end players tackling difficult content wouldn't want anyway. A messy situation.</p><p>Funnily enough, it appears as though Japanese servers are largely doing just fine during the initial release of Savage Heavyweights so far! This is both good and bad. It's good because these server outages are annoying and the less people experience them the better. It's bad because, from the perspective of competitive raiders looking to race each other to a world first clear, it adds a degree of unfairness to the mix. It takes what should be a joyful moment and sours it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this Savage raid release isn't the first time problems like these have hit Final Fantasy 14. In fact,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1prw7jp/ongoing_ddos_issues_megathread/"> it was only around two weeks ago when the American servers suffered several DDOS attacks</a>. For Western FF14 players, this is a problem in desperate need of addressing, especially now that it's impacted one of the more climactic moments in the Dawntrail expansion's life cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/95416d3ef7713bab8490aab037051362b63a074b">A short post on the Final Fantasy 14 website</a> has acknowledged the problem, and states that it's being looked into. However, given the time sensitive nature of these Savage raid races, it's possible for the most dedicated FF14 players, the damage has been done.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/suika-game-planet-now-available-on-us-eshop-for-switch-1-and-2</link>

<header><section>
<p>Pineapple Express</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We reviewed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/suika_game">Suika Game</a> back when it released on Switch in 2023, giving it a 7/10 and calling it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/suika-game">"ripe little puzzler"</a>, and one that you can nab for less than £3. A good thing in this economy, we can all agree.</p>
<p>Now, fans of Suika's puzzling charms can dive into the game's equally colourful-looking sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, which is available to purchase right this very moment for both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suika-game-planet-switch-2/">US eShop</a> (cheers for the heads-up <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/01/06/us-suika-game-planet-now-available-in-nintendo-eshop/">MyNintendoNews</a>). It's priced at <strong>$3.75</strong> on Switch 2, and <strong>$2.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Sadly, there doesn't seem to be an upgrade path (though the game is pretty cheap anyway) and as things currently stand, the game is currently <em>only</em> available on the US eShop. We'll be sure to keep an eye out for it landing in other regions, if and when it does so.</p>
<p>This new sequel moves the breezy puzzle action to space for some intergalactic shenanigans that see you control the dropping of fruit into the centre of your screen in order to pair off and combo from your positioning of fruit types.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A new Suika Game is here from a new setting in space! Turn, target, and aim for the watermelon!</strong></p>
<p>Drop the fruits freely from any direction as ""Poppy"" flies 360° around the planet. Make fruits of the same type collide to make them ""evolve"" and aim to create watermelons for a high score!</p>
<p>Make a lot of fruits ""evolve"" to enter the new ""Super Evolution Time"" mode! Special background music, dramatic effects, and a bonus score bring the excitement to a peak!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch 2 version of the game also supports the console's GameShare function, allowing for up to four players to hash it out in competitive play which, given the style of the puzzling at hand, could get pretty intense and enjoyable. So that's a neat and meaningful addition, especially given the game's ultra-low price tag!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS has announced an expansion thanks to the simulator's widespread success, rendering the outfit "an actual game studio", in TVGS' own words.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/523111043238464175" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, TVGS now has a central office location in Sydney, and the studio has also been able to hire a new developer (whose name is Rob, if you're interested).&nbsp;</p><p>A new 3D and technical artist will also be recruited soon; TVGS says that by the end of 2026, there will "likely be four people working on <em>Schedule I</em>". That might not sound like much, but given that the game is essentially a solo effort right now, that's pretty impressive.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS is doing pretty well for itself, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as revealing the new office, TVGS also says it's releasing a <em>Schedule I </em>patch next week, but don't get too excited; it'll mainly consist of "bug fixing and QoL improvements", in the studio's own words.</p><p>Following that update, the remainder of January will be spent "cleaning up the codebase" and bringing new developer Rob up to speed; TVGS says he's got to "catch up on 120k+ lines of code", so it's not going to be an easy job for him.</p><p>Once all of this is taken care of, TVGS says it will "get to work on the next update", but the studio says it's learned its lesson from prior update delays, so the next major patch for <em>Schedule I </em>won't be announced until TVGS is "confident we'll hit it on time".</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Schedule I </em>is, well, there's no easy way to say this: it's a drug-dealing simulator that lets you peddle illicit substances to all and sundry. Clutch your pearls as you will.</p>
<p><em>Schedule I </em>has indeed proven very successful; at last count, it had a 24-hour Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">player peak</a> of over 30,000.

It’s the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth, allowing it a sub-3ms response time, and the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program. But since it’s been developed in collaboration with LG, the Wolverine V3 BT can only achieve that ultra-low latency when used with compatible LG TVs running webOS 25. It works as a universal Bluetooth gamepad with any device supporting Bluetooth controllers, including other TVs, but it won’t get ultra-low latency when doing so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>It looks a lot like a Wolverine V3 Pro, but with LG’s gaming logo on the power button and TV controls on the D-pad.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>As a TV-first controller, the new Wolverine V3 BT has some living room-friendly features like a built-in mic and TV controls on its D-pad. The new controller is similar to the standard Wolverine V3 Pro, but it lacks hair-trigger lockouts or extra shoulder buttons. Also, it’s got two customizable rear paddle buttons instead of the usual four. While some of that is a downgrade, this controller gets one big upgrade: TMR sticks. The Hall effect sticks on the Wolverine V3 Pro are already anti-drift, but the TMR ones of the V3 BT should be more precise and less power hungry.</p><p>Pricing and availability are not yet finalized for the Wolverine V3 BT.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

It features dual RGB light strips in the top corners, a pair of THX-certified speakers with spatial audio (which can act as the rear channels in 5.1 or 7.1 audio setups), and six haptic motor actuators in the cushions to barrage your back and posterior with <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-sensa" rel="sponsored">Razer’s Sensa</a> rumble.</p><p>Razer took some of these building blocks from previously released chair accessories.

Go ahead, Razer, trademark that.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I got to sit in the Project Madison chair for a brief demo at CES, and I can vouch for two of its three features being at least a little engaging: the speakers and haptics. Playing a quick round of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, I got a nice sense of immersion as I could hear around me without needing to wear headphones. And the different kinds of weapons and character abilities made for varying styles of rumble and haptic sensations in my back and tush.</p><p>But you can’t actually see the lighting while playing, unless you take your eyes off the screen and crane your neck. I had to take my colleague at their word that the chair was lighting up and matching the keyboard and mouse Chroma RGB. Perhaps it’s streamer bait, but at least your head doesn’t block the lights like with Razer’s asinine <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-head-cushion-chroma" rel="sponsored">RGB cushion</a>.</p><p>Razer isn’t disclosing a potential price range for Project Madison, but it would likely sit toward the top of its priciest offerings if it ever actually comes out. Company reps mentioned that last year’s heated and cooled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336722/razer-project-arielle-gaming-chair-heating-cooling-prototype-ces">Project Arielle</a> chair is not going to see a full release, and that’s due to the lofty price Razer would have to charge for it. That doesn’t bode well for Project Madison unless Razer diehards are really clamoring for a chair with all these features built in — but at least they’re features people actually have a history of adopting in modular form.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <title><![CDATA[Viture’s latest AR glasses are as competitive and pricey as ever]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1398283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Smart glasses company Viture had a busy 2025, releasing its solid Luma series of glasses and ensuring that its pro mobile dock is compatible with Nintendo’s Switch 2. Now it’s kicking off 2026 by debuting a new model at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/836627/ces-2026-news-gadgets-announcements">CES</a>, called The Beast, and it’s available to preorder now for $549 with shipping starting in February.</p><p>The price is high for a company known for undercutting Xreal’s glasses with most (but not all) of the same features. In some ways, the price hike is warranted; Viture has caught up with Xreal as it has three degrees of freedom support built-in, letting you anchor your screen in virtual space, or allowing the screen to smoothly follow your head movements. Previous models have required additional hardware or software.</p><p>The Beast’s 58-degree field of view is also impressive since it’s a six-degree improvement over Viture’s previous flagship model (Xreal 1S supports 52 degrees). If you want more than just three dimming options, which is what most smart glasses have offered, the electrochromic tint that The Beast uses offers <em>nine</em> levels of adjustment. This lets you see as much or as little of your surrounding environment as you desire. It also has an embedded camera that will unlock six degrees of freedom in some use cases in the future.</p><p>Depending on the person, those benefits might make The Beast’s $100 premium price worth it compared to the cheaper 1S. They are certainly nice additions, even if they’re not must-have features for the average user.</p><p>One unfortunate omission in The Beast is myopia adjustments. Previous Viture models have dials above each eye’s display to let you make minor tweaks to get a clearer image. Instead, The Beast comes in two sizes (regular and large), but you may need prescription lenses if you’re nearsighted. I, for one, am nearsighted, but I was still able to achieve clear results with some adjustments to the included nose pads.</p><p>If you’re deciding between The Beast and the 1S (or any other AR glasses), here are some specs and thoughts worth knowing: Both support up to 1200p resolution (though Viture says it’s coming after launch) and 120Hz refresh rate. They both have 2D-to-3D conversion features that aim to make content more immersive, though my first impression wasn’t positive with either set. The Beast weigh about 96 grams according to my kitchen scale, while the 1S weighs in at 86 grams (Viture told <em>The Verge</em> that this preproduction unit weighs about two grams more than the final production version). The weight difference is easy to notice, and tweaking the fit of The Beast was all but necessary with its included nose pads. The Xreal 1S’ weight distribution feels more comfortable.</p><p>Anecdotally, I’ve preferred how my games and movies look through Viture’s glasses, even though both brands claim to utilize Sony’s latest micro OLED screens. Text and details appear sharp on The Beast and 1S, though the contrast is richer with Viture’s model. If those who own Viture’s Luma Pro glasses were content with the field of view and not being able to easily anchor the video feed in virtual space, I’m not convinced that these are worth upgrading to. And while Xreal doesn’t have the upper hand on this model in a meaningful way spec-wise, the lower price and weight of the 1S will probably make it the more popular pick.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-fantastic-four-wakanda-namor-teaser-2000657142</link>
            <guid>1398271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I feel like I can’t even keep track of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>all the </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>teasers</span></a><span> anymore. Wasn’t one of these supposed to focus on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689"><span>Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom</span></a><span>? We’re now at the fourth out of the supposed four theater-exclusive trailers declaring that “so-and-so will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” and there’s no sign of the evil doctor yet. This fourth teaser, which is leaking online and also being taken down by Marvel almost immediately after, stars Shuri, the Black Panther, as she prepares the people of Wakanda for what’s to come, and they also meet a hero from another Earth: The Thing.</span></p> <p><span>Though the trailer is getting wiped off social media shortly after it’s been posted, we were able to see it before it got nuked. It opens with Shuri lamenting how she lost her family after the events of </span><i><span>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</span></i><span>, and we also see Namor and members of the underwater Talokan kingdom looking broodily in the distance at…something. But the real highlight is when Shuri and M’Baku greet none other than the Thing himself, Ben Grimm.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Thing and the rest of the Fantastic Four were shown arriving on the MCU’s version of Earth after the events of </span><i><span>Thunderbolts*</span></i><span>, and in </span><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i><span>’ post-credits scene, we saw Doctor Doom taking an interest in Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s god baby, Franklin. We’re not sure yet how that results in the group hopping multiverses, but it is cool to see even the first glimpse of the First Family teaming up with the rest of the MCU.</span></p>

 <p><span>The first three teasers featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491"><span>Steve Rogers</span></a><span>, the ex-Captain America who “retired” at the end of </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> and is now being dragged back into the scrap for probably deeply cynical, nostalgia-baiting reasons; Thor, who prays to his father that he will be able to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1clWprLC5Ak"><span>return to his daughter Love</span></a><span>; and the X-Men, who are also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-trailer-xmen-cyclops-charles-magneto-2000655923"><span>getting pulled into all this</span></a><span>. Again, no sign of Doctor Doom yet. Maybe there will be more teasers than initially believed? Or maybe we still have a while to wait for our first glimpse of RDJ as the ruler of Latveria.</span></p> <p><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>is coming to theaters on December 18.</span></p>

<p data-start="884" data-end="1112">Before purchasing, make sure your devices are compatible with wireless charging. iPhones from the iPhone 12 onwards are all set, as are newer AirPods models. Older devices won’t work with this stand’s wireless charging features.</p>
<p data-start="1114" data-end="1587">What’s really impressive about this wireless charger is its speed. The stand can charge an iPhone 17 Pro to 50% in just 22 minutes, which is pretty fast for wireless charging. It provides 25W charging—better than most other wireless chargers in its class. You can leave your devices on the stand overnight, and they’ll be fully charged by morning. Alternatively, you can keep the stand at your desk while you work.</p>


<p data-start="1589" data-end="1817">The stand also features a display that shows the charging status of your devices and even a clock, making it a great addition to your nightstand. This allows you to easily check the time without lifting your head off the pillow.</p>
<p data-start="1819" data-end="2069">As with all Anker products, safety is a top priority. The MagSafe charging stand uses ActiveShield technology, which monitors temperatures over three million times per day to ensure your devices don’t overheat while charging, keeping everything safe.</p>
<p data-start="2071" data-end="2223">With the Anker MagSafe charging stand, you can clean up your nightstand and keep your devices charged without the mess of cables, all for a great price. There are two color options available. Choose either white or phantom gray. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. It is exactly $0.01 cheaper. But then again, pennies are no longer a thing anymore so I guess they are exactly the same. Get it now for $160.99 or $160.98 for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">That’s down from a starting price of $230, meaning you end up saving $69—equivalent to 30% off.</a></p>
