			<p>As you can guess by the title, Caves of Qud isn't a new game in the slightest. In fact, the game has been available for people to play for about 15 years now, as it's been sat in Early Access since it was announced. This game is well-loved by those who enjoy a roguelike, and Freehold Games announced today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that Caves of Qud has finally experienced a 1.0 launch and is now available for sale on Steam, Itch.io, and GOG.</p>
<p>Caves of Qud is a bit of an outlier in the roguelike category, making it a little bit difficult to put it into one box fully. The game is massive and generates a world full of challenging biomes, including ruins, settlements, and jungles set out to kill you. The game is advertised as a "Science fantasy roguelike epic" as well as a "Deep simulation," which is pretty accurate, as players have free reign in the game. This includes arguing with NPCs and getting into brawls with the most unlikely enemies.</p>
<p>With the release of the 1.0 update, Caves of Qud finally receives a tutorial, which explains the basics of the game to newcomers and to those who want to dip their toes back into the game but may have forgotten how it all works. That's not all, as there is a new final quest in the main questline that initiates the end of the game, along with new music, items, and 40 new achievements for those who enjoy achievement hunting and collecting absolutely everything in the game.</p>
<p>Alongside the 1.0 launch of the game comes the Dromade Deluxe Edition of the game, which includes an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that can unlock some in-game pets right at the start of the game.</p>
<p>One unfortunate note that the development team at Freehold Games has made is that save files prior to 1.0 won't be compatible with the full version of the game. However, if players find that they want to continue with their old saves, they will be able to switch over to the legacy branch in the Betas menu <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For those wanting to purchase the game, it will cost you $30, but there is currently a 15% discount until December 12. Although it's now fully launched, Freehold Games has said that they have planned more content to add to the game and will share details of that at a later date.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-thing-remastered-review-macready-to-rumble.1053228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/thing-remastered-review-macready-to-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love checking out <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios/news" rel="nofollow">Nightdive </a>titles, so I needed to do research on their next game, the then upcoming remaster of 2002's <em>The Thing</em>. The bare minimum I could do is watch the movie, so I finally girded my loins and dove headfirst into this film on a slow Saturday evening.</p>

<p>This was over a month ago now, and I'm still thinking about this damn movie. To hear that the film was received poorly on release seemed inconceivable. The narrative absolutely gripped me, and don't get me started on the cliffhanger ending. Needless to say, I was very excited to see how a sequel could be made out of<em> The Thing</em>.</p>

<p>The result is a pretty fun third-person shooter with ambitious gameplay design that it couldn't quite nail, likely due to the technological restrictions of the time. The story, on the other hand, well... With the movie fresh on my mind, the video game version of <em>The Thing</em> somewhat ruins the intrigue and mystery of the movie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-couch.jpg?itok=qhdZuEMI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-couch.jpg?itok=ElDLQBCa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many iconic scenes happened here. Now it's a ghost town.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong><em>The Thing: Remastered </em></strong>is a<strong><em> </em></strong>Quality Port from Nightdive</h2>

<p>First thing first, though: What makes this worthy of being called <em>The Thing: Remastered?</em> It's safe to say Nightdive never fails to disappoint. This studio makes sure its remasters are accessible and configured to play on different control formats and consoles from the modern day, all the while keeping the game authentic, faithful, and altered only where it needs to be, well, altered.</p>

<p>We're met with a visually exceptional remaster, with greater visual clarity, support for higher frame rates, and much more. Shadows play a big part in <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>, and the lighting looks exceptional. Seeing a dark room brighten from the flamethrower scorching some enemy, it's pretty neat.</p>

<p>I can't say for certain if this is the case for all of Nightdive's remasters and ports, but I know they like to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/killing-time-resurrected-review-mansion-madness" rel="nofollow">remake assets by hand</a>. Since I didn't play <em>The Thing</em> back in the day, I can at least say textures, models, and everything else comprising its graphics looks authentic to the area but have a wonderfully polished look.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-snow.jpg?itok=q5O1WxA1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-snow.jpg?itok=p5xmBoZb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Follow the handrails, and you'll be fine. You still might freeze to death, because that <em>is</em> a thing in this game.</figcaption></figure><p>The end result is a <em>mostly</em> bulletproof port, with a few exceptions. It's very likely that these will be addressed by the time <em>The Thing: Remastered </em>is in players' hands, but I did encounter a few visual bugs that didn't impact the gameplay. My head, for example, disappeared when I got gooped by a Thing parasite.</p>

<p>Other than that, there were some issues with the d-pad that led to cycling to certain weapons when it shouldn't have. Speaking of control schemes, I used both mouse and keyboard, as well as an Xbox controller. Both work well, whatever you decide to use.</p>

<p>Aiming with a controller or mouse makes the reticle lock onto enemies, sort of like <em>GoldenEye 007, </em>so it's basically impossible to miss. I would, however, suggest the controller since it seemed like a more seamless experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-squad.jpg?itok=RfNoFt3- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-squad.jpg?itok=4jC65ZtF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It could be any one of ya!</figcaption></figure><h2>It's Among Us in <em>The Thing: Remastered</em></h2>

<p>From a gameplay perspective, <em>The Thing</em> is a squad-based third-person shooter. AI companions play a huge part in <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>. What is <em>The Thing</em> without mistrust and the constant fear of the parasite being "among us?"</p>

<p>Managing the stress and trust of your squad is an important component here. Equip them with weapons and their trust goes up, but that doesn't stop them from freaking out at the sign of gore and just going batshit insane. That can amplify the stakes of the whole situation.</p>

<p>Squaddies are as useful as they are annoying. They're great at blasting away aliens and can do it better than the player, really, but they're an awkward bunch. Other than having to deal with their stress, getting them to follow you is sometimes finicky.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-commands.jpg?itok=Ze3T219z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-commands.jpg?itok=tGq5VKpG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can give guns and ammo to squaddies, and give them rudimentary commands.</figcaption></figure><p>There are ways to deal with their stress, like giving them an adrenaline injection or having them move away from scenes of carnage, but it didn't feel all that necessary most of the time since it happens off and on so frequently. I have to commend the original developers for creating such a system, as it was surely ambitious back in the day. Nowadays, it's fun to engage with for a bit but perhaps outstays its welcome.</p>

<p>Squad members are also very disposable. <em>The Thing: Remastered</em> will transition to a new level and just have them inexplicably gone, like they didn't even matter. And that's true for the most part -- squad members have different roles, but the only ones that are important are engineers. They can repair control panels to open doors, which serve as a way to block progress.</p>

<p>Either way, most squad members can and will die. Heck, some might turn into a Thing and attack. As far as I could tell, when they inevitably turn, those are scripted events. Sometimes during combat, if squad members are attacked, they can turn earlier than their scripted time, which adds just a bit of tension. Ultimately, since allies are ditched so fast, it's hard to see the full potential of the fear/trust system</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-flamethrower.jpg?itok=JggOaoJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-flamethrower.jpg?itok=u73Leowi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When it doubt, bring out the flames.</figcaption></figure><p>A squad member turning isn't all that big of a deal, since <em>The Thing: Remastered</em> pumps you with ammo and weapons. Firing a bunch of bullets into one of the monsters will soften it up, then you set it on fire with a flame-based weapon and they're done for. It's a fun little encounter when bigger monsters show up, since who doesn't love using a flamethrower?</p>

<p>Add a few boss battles in there for variation, and there you have it. Exploring all the environments, managing your squad, and using that flamethrower make <em>The Thing: Remastered</em> entertaining. It's short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome, and that's just about all you could ask for in a licensed game such as this. Now if only the story was up to snuff.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-combat.jpg?itok=jTkVORHv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-combat.jpg?itok=HRJdpne2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A once fearsome enemy becomes something more like a horde of thoughtless horrors.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>The Thing: Remastered </em> Bungles the Story</h2>

<p>Oh boy, here we go: <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>'s narrative. Apparently, this game is a canonical sequel to the 1982 movie. It was around the halfway point of the story I made a mental note telling myself this is <em>not </em>canonical. This game absolutely ruins the mystery of <em>The Thing</em>. It resolves the movie's ending cliffhanger in the first hour, so that's already a bummer when it concluded in such a strong way.</p>

<p>The narrative morphs this unknowable cosmic horror into something much more tangible, resembling any other typical alien parasite from media. We're also led to see there are sprawling research stations in Antarctica experimenting on the Thing.</p>

<p>Were these institutions here all along, or did they crop up after the mishap at U.S. Outpost 31? I could be wrong, but I was led to believe the Norwegians uncovered the alien parasite, and from there it eliminated their research station and made its way to R.J. MacReady and the crew.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-combat-2.jpg?itok=R7J2ZctR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-combat-2.jpg?itok=M0tpwAL- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Only one way to deal with this.</figcaption></figure><p>The story doesn't give much clarity on this, nor does it give itself time to flesh out the plot. Cutscenes are really brief, and barely give any exposition to help players along. I really don't think it's a matter of <em>The Thing</em> being an old game. It just comes across as <em>The Thing</em> fan fiction.</p>

<p>You're eventually fighting against other soldiers and it turns into some sort of generic action shooter, at least from a narrative perspective. It's just downright silly, yet I can't get too mad at it because the game's dialogue is so cheesy. You can tell from this dialogue that it really is a product of its time, and so I do feel some nostalgia and entertainment from that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-archive.jpg?itok=0IlTNE0i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-archive.jpg?itok=byg_Mz8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In<em> </em>Nightdive fashion, we can check out old concept art and more from the game's original development.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>The Thing: Remastered</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's worth reiterating that Nightdive made another outstanding port. The improvements to visuals, controls, and overall feel are sure to satisfy those who played <em>The Thing</em> over two decades ago. If it's your first time, and you're a fan of <em>The Thing</em>, it's also going to be a fun experience, even if the story doesn't serve as a good follow-up to the 1982 movie. Shooting a Thing in the face, though? Now that's some good stuff.</p>

            <p>The demimimise of Mimimi means I'm now on the lookout for my next opportunity to crouch behind a hedge, distract a man with a stone or coin, and then choke him unconscious. (And in the game.) Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream looks like a worthy candidate. Announced last year, there's now a new trailer showing the isometric (isometrish?) narrative stealth in action.

<p>The story sounds a bit Plague Tale-like: Hanna has awoken after a long illness when her brother Herman promptly goes missing. Hanna sets off to find him, with two other playable protagonists, Alva and Sebastian, helping on the journey. That seems to be where the similarities end, mind. The camera is positioned on high, giving you a birds-eye view of your sneaking, for a start. 
</p>
<p>Eriksholm is also a fictional city, albeit inspired by Nordic-inspired cities of the 1900s. It looks like there's considerable unrest in the city, with the invention fo steam-driven machines, an authoritarian force hunting you for some reason, and something called the 'Heartpox' glimpsed in trailers. Maybe a bit of Dunwall-style worldbuilding, with yer Plague Tale family dynamics and Mimimi body-hiding? A canny mixture.
</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to us getting a chance to play this. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is aiming for release in 2025 via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9">Epic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">house made of house</a>. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Each room harbours secrets, and it’s your job to join those secrets up and discover the mysterious 46th room - which, strictly speaking, won’t fit into the floorplan. The only constraint placed upon the house’s werehousian tendencies is your character’s fatigue, which confines you to a certain number of steps each in-game day. You can bend that constraint, however, by means of various room properties and collectible objects. Sound fun? I bring good news, then - Blue Prince is now pegged to release in spring 2025. Here’s a trailer to celebrate.</p>

<p>And here are some piping hot press release bullet points, for people who couldn’t be bothered to click on my preview link, above.</p>
<blockquote><p>- Draft your journey - Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets, as well as offering or taking resources. But choose carefully, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms one sees today may not be the same rooms one sees tomorrow.</p>
<p>- Every step counts - Progress each day is shaped by the rooms selected to draft and the tools found within them. Yet, tread wisely – when the floor plan resets at the end of the day, all but the permanent upgrades to the estate blueprint will be lost.</p>
<p>- History in the making - Investigate a past woven with the threads of blackmail, political intrigue, and the mysterious disappearance of a local children’s book author. The deeper one ventures, the more one realizes that the past is closer than it appears.</p></blockquote>

While essential for keeping the base functional, crafting tools, and mining resources, their distinct personalities can spark tension. Despite their differences, they share a common goal: survive, escape, and rely only on themselves.</p><p>The game explores the timeless question: “What if I had chosen differently?” This core theme fuels a deeply personal and thought-provoking narrative as players navigate Jan’s struggle for survival.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>A newly announced TMNT game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown/" data-ref-id="5000-653831">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, will see Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello eschew their usual genre of sidescrolling beat-em-up for a new turn-based adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">TMNT: Tactical Takedown comes from developer Strange Scaffold, the minds behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator/" data-ref-id="5000-525368">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a> and this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/i-am-your-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-631987">I Am Your Beast</a>. The developer promises a "bold new approach" to the TMNT universe, and not just because of the game's turn-based tactics gameplay, a first for the franchise. It's also due to the game's story, which will see the Turtles growing apart as they teeter on the edge of adulthood in a world where Master Splinter and their arch nemesis Shredder are both dead.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwKmulVHmXI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WwKmulVHmXI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, there will be 20 levels for players to battle through, divided into four campaigns focusing on different characters. Battle arenas will "grow, shrink, and add new threats each turn," with the game's visuals adopting a comic-book-style look combined with mini-figurines and dioramas. TMNT: Tactical Takedown will also sport a "multi-genre" soundtrack from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-paso-elsewhere/" data-ref-id="5000-532811">El Paso, Elsewhere</a> composer RJ Lake.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Turtle will have a customizable move set that looks to capitalize on their unique fighting styles while also allowing for clever use of the environment. Despite being turn-based, the game's debut trailer shows plenty of moving around, as the Turtles leap and bounce off enemies and reposition to set up their attacks for success.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for TMNT: Tactical Takedown just yet.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/climbing-game-cairn-is-exactly-my-jam.1053162/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cairn-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I would like to spend every day playing rock climbing games, which are currently the closest I can get to actual climbing until I somehow solve all of my scheduling problems and go to the gym again. But in the absence of having a life that makes sense, at least I can play the demo for <em>Cairn</em>, a game that caught my eye the moment it was announced back at Summer Game Fest, and which I am so excited to finally get my hands on.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a>, out now, features the game’s introductory area and an early game rock face to scale. It introduces the game’s story of protagonist Aava planning to scale a mountain called Kami, which no human has climbed before, and which less than half have returned from. To accomplish this, she has a robot buddy who can supply her with pitons, letting her build and retrieve anchors as she climbs higher and higher.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cairn | Authentic Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4In8-k2A-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I struggled a bit to get the hang of the actual climbing, which sits somewhere between games like <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jusant</em></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-would-live-in-this-climbing-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Valley Peaks</em></a> that focus more on anchor points and full body movement, and games like <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Heights</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mobile-game-crux-lets-you-rock-climb-without-going-to-t-1845024500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crux</em></a> that focus on moving each limb individually. You control each of Aava’s limbs, but the game chooses which arm or leg you move; you position them with your left thumbstick and then place them by pressing X. I struggled to get a hang of this, feeling like I couldn’t always get Aava to make the moves I would have made in the order I wanted to make them in. I sometimes found myself trying to outthink the game’s choices by rapidly pressing X, but this wasn’t a great strategy either. The climbing felt the best when I tried to move more quickly, but not so quickly that I got myself tangled up and fell. I appreciate the way <em>Cairn</em>’s design does away with some of the tedious micro-management of more methodical games, but I’m not quite sure it works for me yet. The opening gym area has lots of optional routes you can climb outside the tutorial; I’ve already spent way too much time with them and am looking forward to spending more until I feel like I have the climbing down.</p><p>Even in these man-made areas, there are no pre-set routes in <em>Cairn</em>; you can try to climb anything, whether or not it’s a viable way to go. Developer The Game Bakers told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-manual-climbing-system-is-like-a-vertical-death-stranding-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> that “there is no human-made animation” given this freedom, which means I sometimes twisted Aava into disturbing shapes. But it does mean you need to pay attention to your environment and think about route planning (my least strong climbing skill). You also need to pay a lot of attention to Aava to tell how a climb is going; she’ll gasp and shake if you’re in a bad position, making the climbing feel visceral and intense. You can recover your stamina with a button press if you’re in a good spot, and you can also place pitons, which you can hang from to recover or to go into your inventory. These also make sure that if you fall, you don’t die or end up all the way back on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if I’m still feeling out the climbing, what I unreservedly love about <em>Cairn</em> is its survival elements. You can enter Aava’s bivouac, where she can use destroyed pitons to create new ones, sleep to recover health, and cook on a hanging camping stove. I <em>love</em> the cooking, which lets you combine ingredients into meals that, when you eat in your tent, feature the delightful touch of their UI description getting bites taken out of it until it’s gone. I was so enamored of this system that I cooked and ate all my food almost immediately, needlessly chowing down on instant noodles and a sad hot chocolate made from water, and then needed food later and didn’t have it. You can forage for food in the world, as well as refill your water bottles from streams. All this stuff goes in your backpack, another awesome touch: everything is just piled up in there, and you can shake it around and see it move.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of a game with climbing mechanics combined with <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival</a> elements is basically a game designed specifically for me to spend all my time in. When combined with the freedom to choose your own way up the mountain, I am so psyched for what <em>Cairn</em> is doing, even if I'm still feeling it out. I am going to publish this blog and then keep playing it, which you can do now too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-drops-free-tech-demo-unveils-roadmap-of-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Brendan Greene, more commonly known as PLAYERUNKNOWN, has dropped a lot of announcements at the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025. To start with, his company has released a free tech demo called Preface: Undiscovered World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. This demo is meant to showcase the in-house Melba engine that PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has been developing. Greene said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU. This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback contributes to its future development.</em></p>
<p>The studio also launched the Steam page for their first actual game, the single player survival open world title Prologue: Go Wayback!, which will allow the development team to test the machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, enabling the instant creation of millions of maps.</p>
<p>In Prologue: A Way Back, players will explore a detailed world where emergent systems influence gameplay. They'll face unpredictable weather events and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to escape the untamed wilderness.</p>
<p>A series of playtests should start soon, with the objective of launching the game on Steam Early Access in Q2 of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! First Look - PC Gamer Live: Most Wanted" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsFg6xNCin0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, PLAYERUNKNOWN outlined his vision for the final game in this slate, codenamed Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time, and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we’re developing.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Our Studio Journey with PLAYERUNKNOWN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last we heard about Artemis, PLAYERUNKNOWN <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-says-prologue-will-likely-be-boring-artemis-will-be-planet-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be 'planet-sized'. That was over three years ago, so things might have changed, but it definitely sounds like the goal is still to make an absolutely massive world.</p>

			<p>Since its release, Citizen Sleeper has been remarked as one of the best indie games of recent times. It even has a Lost in Cult Design Works book dedicated to the game. It's been revealed today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that the sequel to the sci-fi RPG will be released on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on 31 January 2025 and will be available on Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>The first Citizen Sleeper was released in 2022 and won multiple awards, as well as being nominated for four BAFTAS, which included British Game and Game for Impact. This title explores political themes and is accompanied by a fantastically immersive soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpiEhTVuISc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developer Jump Over The Age has decided to bring back the Hexport demo so that those interested in the upcoming game can get a taste of what's to come in the full release of Citizen Sleeper's sequel. This demo was previously released for a limited time during Steam Next Fest and will now be available from today until 8 December.</p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector was first announced in June 2023, and it's been stated by the developers that the sequel will be sticking to a similar template to the first game, as you follow a new Sleeper android protagonist out into space, using the same dice mechanics that were used in the first game. It's been said by Creator Gareth Damian Martin that the central theme for the sequel was "crisis," which is something that the world has seen a lot of. The influences for the theme came from major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a talk with RockPaperShotgun, Gareth Damian Martin spoke about what narrative means to him, and how he uses it to affect the players: "When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything. Because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist," says Martin.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favorite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p>
<p>January is just around the corner, and those excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector won't have long to wait at all. Until then, check out the trailer above and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3198860/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector__Hexport_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexport demo</a> on Steam.</p>

But now, Greene’s studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, is detailing what it’s working on — and there are multiple games in the works, all pointing toward a big final project.</p><p>First up is a game called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2943740%2FPrologue_Go_Wayback%2F"><em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em></a>, described as a “single-player open-world emergent game within the&nbsp;survival genre,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22656508/player-unknown-brendan-green-pubg-prologue-open-world">which was previously teased in 2021</a>. The big hook, it seems, is technical, as the game is being built with “machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, allowing the instant creation of millions of maps.” <em>Prologue </em>is expected to launch in early access on Steam in 2025, following a series of playtests. To showcase what players can expect, the studio is launching a free tech demo on Steam today called <em>Preface: Undiscovered World</em>. You can check it out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2820060%2FPreface_Undiscovered_World%2F">right here</a>.</p><p>According to the studio, these games are building blocks on the way to a more ambitious game currently codenamed “Artemis,” which will be a “massive multiplayer sandbox experience.” Greene previously talked about Artemis back in 2022; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377207/playerunknown-artemis-melba-open-world-prologue-player-content-nft">it was originally billed as a game with NFT support</a>, though today’s announcement has no mention of NFTs. Here’s Greene on what players can eventually expect as the studio builds toward its big game:</p><div><blockquote><p>My vision for Artemis is challenging,&nbsp;but we plan to take it one step at a time and the&nbsp;three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation&nbsp;on which to scale up.

            <p>Covering announcement shows mean saving oneself for huge reveals, and since I might be the only person in the world right now this excited for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mekkablood-quarry-assault">Mekkablood: Quarry Assault</a>, I wondered if it might be better to hold off until a less pressing time. And then I thought, no: the people need to know. Not about the game itself, since it's been announced for a while. Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!</p>

<p>“They didn’t take my mech, and now they’re gonna take this two-tonne foot, straight up their corporate bums!” boasts the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duke-nukem">Duke Nukem</a> soundalike in the trailer. At least, I assume it’s ‘bums’. It’s bleeped out. It might be something more wholesome. Or something much, much worse. Either way, I’m down. That’s all the motivation I need these days.</p>
<p>Here’s what the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3056270/Mekkablood_Quarry_Assault/"> Steam page</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Year is 2082. You play the role of Bill, a grizzled, and extremely hairy robojockey. It's up to you to take the reigns of Bill's Mekk, with your friend Rusty, to get your revenge against TorxCorp, who's trying to steal your mining claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some features. Just the absolute best features. Love them.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mekk Combat</strong></p>
<p>Relive the glory days of the good old days with this first-person mech take on the classic Boomer Shooter gameplay. The in-cockpit view gives the retro 16-bit FPS feel a whole new twist.</p>
<p><strong>A Dance of Metal</strong></p>
<p>Moving around in your sluggish Mekk feels surprisingly smooth, Bill has truly mastered the giant robot’s controls like no other. And his weapons pack a punch! Make Swiss cheese of the enemies with bullets from afar or get up-close and personal with your dual saws.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>Bill is a grizzled, and extremely hairy middle-aged man who doesn’t take shit from anyone. Torxcorp is going to get a 2-ton foot, straight up their ass for trying to take what is his.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets</strong></p>
<p>Discover secret areas in each level to find back your limited edition dash figurines. Spruce up your cockpit and watch them shake &amp; sway along with the action.</p></blockquote><p>


Mekkablood: Quarry Assault is "coming soon". Sucks for you, literally every other videogame.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/brendan-greene-pubg-creator-three-game-survival/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Brendan ‘PlayerUnknown’ Greene’s PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has revealed a three-game plan that’s being kickstarted with an open-world survival game – <em>‘Prologue: Go Wayback!’</em> </p>



<p>This news was revealed today by Greene’s team, and it was accompanied by a six-minute trailer showcasing the future of these projects. In 2021, PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions was founded in Amsterdam to ultimately deliver an ambitious, massively multiplayer world dubbed Project Artemis.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-father-of-battle-royale">‘The Father of Battle Royale’</h2>



<p>Many consider Brendan Greene to be the father of the modern battle royale genre. He is responsible for the creation of PUBG, which was released in 2017 and went on to inspire the likes of Fortnite, Free Fire, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Brendan Greene <strong>is </strong>PlayerUnknown – it’s <strong>his </strong>Battleground that you’re occupying when you play PUBG.</p>



<p>PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions is working on building an ‘Earth-sized’ MMO called Project Artemis, but before it gets there, it’s working on a single-player, open-world survival game, the name of which has just been revealed as ‘Prologue: Go Wayback!’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Since 2021, Greene’s projects have been kept more or less under wraps, and only a fireside chat here and there has served as a stage for players to get updates on PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. In an article from PC Gamer published in September, it was revealed that the team had created an entire planet that uses advanced rendering technology to load vast swathes of land almost instantly.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was said that this technology ‘(allows for) the instant creation of millions of maps’. </p>



<p>In the same release, Greene explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. </p>



<p>After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we’re developing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed in that article that Greene wants to create a world that can support thousands of concurrent players – with a long-term goal to accommodate <strong>millions </strong>of players. It’s hugely ambitious, but the groundwork is being laid as we speak.</p>



<p>Alongside the reveal of the three-game plan, it was announced that players will be able to explore a free tech demo called Preface: Undiscovered World, which has been built using PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions’ engine, Melba. </p>



<p>This tech demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now on Steam</a>, and Prologue: Go Wayback! is expected <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to launch on PC</a> in early access in Q2 of 2025.</p>

                <p>While many consider Fortnite to be the pinnacle of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, developed by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, was the first to bring mainstream attention to the format. Since then, Greene has formed his own studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, and today the team has announced a three-game plan for the future, which begins with Prologue: Go Wayback.</p><p dir="ltr">Prologue is described as a "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre," which will incorporate a new "machine-learning-driven terrain-generation technology" developed by the team. This new tech will allow the game to create "millions" of maps at once, though the specifics of how the tech works were not disclosed. Prologue: Go Wayback is set to launch in Steam Early Access in Q2 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvK-bQwd03g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The end goal of the three-game plan is Project Artemis, though little is known about what Greene and his team have planned. "My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time," Greene says, "and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up."</p><p dir="ltr">Along with Prologue and Project Artemis's announcement comes Preface: Undiscovered World, which is a tech demo intended to showcase Melba, PlayerUnknown Productions' new in-game development engine. Preface is in addition to the main three-game plan, and Greene says that the demo will generate an "Earth-sized planet" in real time, with players able to give feedback while exploring. Preface: Undiscovered World is available now for free on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Greene's previous project, PlayerUnknown's Battleground is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices.</p>
