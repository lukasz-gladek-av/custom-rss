            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo released the very first trailer for upcoming cinematic sequel&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, as well as introducing a couple of new characters who will be voiced by some pretty big names.</p>

<p>As part of a (rather short) Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, along with Illumination's Chris Meledandri, provided a first look at the movie, which will be released on April 3rd around the world.</p>

<p>Naturally, the movie's chief inspiration is 2007's classic&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and so one of that game's biggest characters will be joining the cast; it's none other than cosmic Princess Rosalina, who will be voiced by "Nintendo superfan" Brie Larson.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-luigi.jpg?itok=k16Tc0aC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-luigi.jpg?itok=ww1jr9su 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>will seemingly pick up right where its predecessor left off.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosalina's introduction comes as she reads a story to her adorable Lumas, who begins telling them about "a brave and noble Princess named Peach" before the Lumas request "the one about the plumbers".</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like she'll be a helpless damsel, though; we also get to see her do battle with a giant mech, and she's got some serious combat prowess, although this being Rosalina, her fighting style is very graceful.</p>

<p>Also joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>is Bowser Jr., who appears to be out for revenge against the Mario brothers for what they did to his father in the first movie. He's voiced by cinema auteur Benny Safdie.</p>

<p>During the course of the trailer, we get to see Bowser Jr. suit up in his&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine&nbsp;</em>mask, and he's wielding his paintbrush from that game as well, so it looks like the movie will roll in more influences than just the&nbsp;<em>Galaxy&nbsp;</em>games.</p>




<p>If the first movie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow">box office performance</a> is anything to go by,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>will almost certainly be a cinematic hit. Nintendo has promised more info about the movie in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for that.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc-brings-24-hour-races-and-more-in-december.1351210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Power Pack DLC, which brings 24-hour endurance races, a huge credit injection, and more next month.</p>

<p>It turns out that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc" rel="nofollow">isn't the only game</a> getting a big DLC pack on December 4th, as that's also when&nbsp;Power Pack <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_1147434.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches</a>. If you're playing&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>on PS4, though, you won't get access to this DLC, unfortunately.</p>

<p>PS5 players can look forward to "50 new races across 20 categories", according to Polyphony Digital, including "24-hour endurance racing" and more. The ability to play through a full race session, including practice, qualifying, and the race itself, will also be added.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-dlc-power-pack-nurburgring.jpg?itok=Chm56toR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-dlc-power-pack-nurburgring.jpg?itok=2KR1UFbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is getting a round of paid DLC in December, bringing new races and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The Power Pack will also bring the latest version of&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s proprietary Sophy AI system, which can now offer "nail-biting close quarters tail-to-nose racing" (but only if you pick up the DLC; otherwise, you'll be stuck with the previous version of the AI).</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you can look forward to a huge bonus of five million in-game credits if you pick up the Power Pack. That should help you pick up a fair few of the cars that have been introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-162" rel="nofollow">previous</a> free <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the game.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the seventh mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers (which essentially means it's somewhere between a real gearhead's racing sim and a more arcade-y offering).</p>

<p>The game, which was released back in 2022, allows players to race across a variety of real-world tracks using cars from huge name brands like Aston Martin, Ferrari, and Maserati, among many others.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Power Pack DLC when it launches exclusively for PlayStation 5 on December 4th. The game, unlike its DLC, is available for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both PS5 and PS4</a> right now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-coming-in-december.1351207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, the first major DLC expansion for multiplayer Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and it's heading your way in December.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-reveals-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launching-december-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, which launches on December 4th, will add two brand new Nightfarers for you to play as, plus new bosses, a new shifting earth condition, and more.</p>

<p>Specifically, you can look forward to two new third-day Nightlord bosses, as well as more iconic bosses from across both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>making their appearance in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>when&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>launches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-lion.jpg?itok=IxQmIQyd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-lion.jpg?itok=vzYzLqAd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Divine Beast Dancing Lion is just one of the new bosses you'll face in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Returning bosses include&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s Divine Beast Dancing Lion,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Knight Artorias, and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, and it looks like there may be some new mid-bosses for you to tackle as well.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the two new Nightfarers will be, but it looks like one will use a spellbook to attack enemies, while the other will buff itself with what looks like some kind of dark magic during combat. We'll likely find out more about these new classes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>spinoff that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">definitely isn't</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2</em>; rather, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired roguelite in which your goal is to explore a shrinking map, looting supplies and battling bosses.</p>

<p>Each run takes place over three nights, and at the conclusion of each night, you'll fight a miniboss, with the third night culminating in an encounter with that run's chosen Nightlord boss.</p>




<p>The game was released back in May to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">strong sales reception</a>, and since launch, it's received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">a two-player mode</a>&nbsp;and a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty" rel="nofollow">difficulty level</a> for truly dedicated players.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>DLC will arrive on December 4th. The base game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can read my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Doings are afoot in the retrofuture scrapmetal world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. Developers Embark have announced that a major new update called North Line will roll out tomorrow, 13th November at 1.30am PT, 4.30am ET, 9.30am GMT and 10.30am CET. It'll add Stella Montis, a region beyond the Rust Belt that is described as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions." I am picturing a landscape awash with Betamax cassettes, Bored Apes and Soviet space shuttles, where Raiders pick through old branches of Toys R Us.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You won't just be able to waltz across the lintel into Stella Montis tomorrow, mind. You'll need to earn access by means of a new community event, Breaking New Ground, which is about restoring tunnels to the new region by earning a special events currency, Merits. "The release timing of Stella Montis will be set by community progress, revealing the next frontier and triggering the "Staking Our Claim" Phase II, a new progression track with rewards to earn and challenges to complete," explains the press release. "This new track will be available for a limited time, running until December." 
</p>
<p>
The devs are also adding a couple of new ARC foes - the Matriarch, which is apparently even more formidable than the Queen - and the Shredder, which only appears in Stella Montis, and is built for close quarters combat. It sounds rather knifey. Players will go up against them armed with an "Energy Burst" battle rifle, some new mines - that's "Impulse", "Timed" and "Gas Jump", the latter of which sounds like a platforming tool - and some fresh playstyles, "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lone-wolf">Lone Wolf</a> and "Trailblazer". I'm not clear what these playstyles are but I don't think you'll get to be an actual wolf. The ARCs have melted down all the wolves for biofuel, I suspect. Still, there's always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-dorks-it-is-not-too-late-to-be-a-janky-ass-wolf">WolfQuest</a>.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to maximise the good vibes around North Line's launch, Embark are also taking an axe to the game's microtransaction pricing. "We've reviewed our prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable," explains <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/">a new FAQ on the official site</a>. The prices will be update alongside the update's launch.</p>
<p>"For any Raider who has already made a purchase on the old pricing, we'll compensate you for the difference," the developers add. "These Raider Tokens will be refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week." 
</p>
<p>
These concessions accompany a note that Embark will shortly introduce paid premium Raider decks that focus on "cosmetics and convenience", with no "pay-to-win" elements. So this is mollifying the people unhappy about microtransaction pricing while introducing a few more microtransactables with their other hand.
</p><p>
Last and leastly, Embark say they have "silently tested and enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking, beginning earlier this week." To be clear, duo here means two-player. "Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately," the devs explain. "After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios."
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders continues to be the subject of scorn regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">its usage of AI-generated voices</a>. There was another social media blowout yesterday and I have been working on a short op ed, because (hint hint) only op eds are allowed to be political. There is a non-zero chance I will eventually decide that it's rubbish and bin it off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Samuel Horti addressed the game's generative AI usage in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders review</a>, commenting that Embark's research projects around generating gun models "could well change how I feel about a game where the presence of AI voices already makes me feel slightly icky about recommending it."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since the game launched on October 30, one map on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ rotation has remained locked. That’s about to change. The mysterious “Stella Montis” map will soon be available following a community event to unlock it. And when players arrive, there’ll be new Arc to contend with. They don’t sound friendly. The new community event kicks off tomorrow, November 13, 2025. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>

 <p>Developer Embark Studios has revealed what’s in store for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first major post-launch content update and community event (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-first-major-update-north-line-goes-live-tomorrow-heres-what-to-expect">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). But before anyone can step foot on the new frontier of Stella Montis, players will have to work for it via “Breaking New Ground,” described as a “multi-phase community event leading to a Stella Montis unlock.”</p>

 <p>There aren’t too many details about what, exactly, players will be doing during the event. But the developer has promised “rare resources, new gameplay items, and potential weapon blueprints.” The event will feature its own currency, “Merits,” and will only be available until December.</p> <p>Once accessible, Stella Montis will be home to an exclusive Arc, the Shredder. Embark describes the threat as something that will force “Raiders to stay sharp in close-quarters encounters.” Good news for those tired of shooting drones and rolly things that go pop. Other than that, the “Matriarch” Arc is being described as a “hulking Arc that makes the Queen look friendly.”</p> <p>Oh. How joyous.</p> <p>The new community event goes live on November 13 at 10:30 A.M. EST.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skins-cosmetics-decks-battle-pass-duos-2000643456</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-lowering-skin-prices-and-issuing-refunds-after-backlash.1351192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>While <i>Arc Raiders</i> certainly isn’t alone in featuring paid cosmetics and, soon, battle passes, the game has come under fire from fans since launch for its pricey skins and concerns that some items in the upcoming premium battle passes will be “pay-to-win.” In a blog post outlining some pricing changes, however, developer Embark Studios is responding to player feedback and concern, lowering prices on existing cosmetics and clarifying what fans can expect when premium battle passes arrive.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gifts-premium-currency-after-server-struggles-2000640888">Backlash against expensive skin pricing</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i> swiftly followed the game’s release on October 30. With the game selling for $40 rather than being free-to-play, fans weren’t too happy about skins in the premium store costing half that. Meanwhile, the limited customization options associated with cheaper items like face paints have seemed to discourage folks from getting too excited over them.</p>

 <p>But <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/">according to an official blog post</a> today, Embark Studios is lowering prices on skins and refunding folks (in premium currency) who purchased them at the older, more expensive price. Furthermore, the studio has clarified that any usable gameplay items found in upcoming battle passes will be in the free versions available to all players. “The focus for premium [battle passes] are based on cosmetics and convenience,” the developer wrote.</p>

 <p>As some fans have pointed out, since you can lose gear in an extraction shooter just as easily as you can find it, gameplay items in a premium battle pass wouldn’t be locked to a player and thus wouldn’t be as unfair in theory, but it’s still nice to see the game avoid any accusations of being pay-to-win.</p>

 <h2>Duo matchmaking was secretly enabled</h2> <p>Since launch, players have asked for duo-only matchmaking, allowing pairs of folks to venture out into games populated by other pairs. Embark Studios confirmed that it has “silently tested and enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking” earlier this week. While it cautioned that “you may [still] run into differing constellations of players other than your own,” the developer described the matchmaking system like this:</p> <blockquote><p>First, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios.</p></blockquote> <p>As a solo player, I haven’t been too bothered by mismatched player counts in squads out there, but hopefully this will help balance out PvP skirmishes in the near future.</p>

The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales is celebrating its 5-year anniversary today, November 12, 2025. Below, we examine how the half-sequel capitalized on its smaller scope by telling a more intimate story.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Miles Morales swings past a small bodega as snow flurries catch the streetlights. Below him, vendors huddle in heavy coats, music spills from a corner bodega, and the streets of Harlem glow warm against the winter cold. The rhythm of the city seems to match his own momentum--fast, hopeful, alive. It’s familiar territory, but not quite the same New York Peter Parker protected previously. The city feels different now, more personal. It’s Miles’ home.</p><p dir="ltr">When Spider-Man: Miles Morales launched alongside the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, it didn’t look like a revolution. It wasn’t a full sequel, didn’t stretch across new boroughs, and didn’t introduce an entirely new rogues’ gallery. On paper, it was a stopgap--a smaller-scale spin-off meant to show off Sony’s new console and tide fans over until the next big thing.</p><p dir="ltr">But that undersells what Insomniac actually made. Instead of expanding outward, the studio looked inward. It took the same foundation that made Marvel’s Spider-Man such a triumph and reimagined it through a different lens. The result was a tighter, more emotional, and more focused adventure that did what few open-world games ever attempt: it made a familiar world feel new again.</p><p dir="ltr">The New York City Insomniac created in 2018 was already alive. The challenge wasn’t to make something bigger--it was to make something more meaningful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4599931-3756719-marvel_sspider-man_milesmorales_20201023193836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599931" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4599931-3756719-marvel_sspider-man_milesmorales_20201023193836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599931"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4599931-3756719-marvel_sspider-man_milesmorales_20201023193836.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Miles Morales is set during the winter holidays, with snow blanketing the rooftops and light reflecting off every icy windowpane. It’s the same city, but seen through different eyes. The change in season mirrors Miles himself: young, still growing, but confident enough to leave his own mark on a place that was once someone else’s domain.</p><p dir="ltr">In Harlem, where much of the story unfolds, the cultural heartbeat is unmistakable. Street murals honor local heroes, Puerto Rican flags flutter from apartment balconies, and conversations shift easily between English and Spanish. Miles himself, who has a Puerto Rican and African-American background, switches between the two throughout the story.</p><p dir="ltr">This New York is a living, breathing reflection of its new Spider-Man. It’s not Peter’s city anymore. It’s Miles’ world, infused with his rhythm and his energy.</p><p dir="ltr">“This is a full arc for Miles Morales that started in Spider-Man,” Insomniac creative director Brian Horton told <a href="https://ew.com/gaming/game-on-inside-marvel-games/" rel="nofollow ">Entertainment Weekly</a> before the game's release. “We really are completing this hero’s coming of age in our game. It is a complete story.”</p><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man: Miles Morales narrows its focus in ways that make it stronger. Where Peter’s story in the first game revolved around juggling adulthood, heroism, and a sprawling cast of villains, Miles’ journey is quieter, more concentrated, and more personal.</p><p dir="ltr">“When we started crafting it,” Horton said. “We realized that, with a little bit more of a compact storytelling style, we could tell a very emotionally impactful story that would fit really well as an experience that would take Spider-Man 1 and [Miles Morales] and do justice to this character.”</p><p dir="ltr">That focus pays off. The story’s stakes aren’t world-ending- they’re local. When Harlem becomes the center of conflict between Roxxon Energy and the Underground, led by the Tinkerer, it feels personal. It was about about protecting home.</p><p dir="ltr">Too often, open-world games treat their worlds as disposable. Once the story ends, the setting is abandoned, its life frozen in time as NPCs wander the streets. Miles Morales takes a different approach.</p><p dir="ltr">By revisiting the same city and recontextualizing it through Miles’ perspective, Insomniac proved that open worlds don’t need to be replaced to stay relevant--they can evolve. Snowfall and holiday decorations give Manhattan a new visual identity, but it’s the emotional context that truly changes how players experience it. Familiar streets now hold new meaning because the character inhabiting them sees them differently.</p><p dir="ltr">That approach shows the value of continuity. Reusing assets wasn’t a shortcut; it was an opportunity to refine and enrich what already worked. Harlem’s sense of community, the mixtapes from Miles’ uncle, and the voices of neighbors echoing from windows all make the city feel lived in.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s a design philosophy other developers could learn from. Instead of chasing sheer size, studios could let their worlds age and transform alongside their characters. Imagine a series where time actually passes, where familiar places bear the marks of past adventures. Miles Morales hints at that kind of storytelling--one where the world grows with the hero. It's easier said than done, of course.

this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">On the surface, Spider-Man: Miles Morales served as a technical showcase for the PS5. Its reflections glimmered with ray tracing, fast travel was instantaneous, and every frame highlighted the hardware’s power. But its real strength came from something far subtler: restraint.</p><p dir="ltr">At roughly ten hours, the main story moves with purpose. There’s less filler compared to almost every other open world adventure. The pacing mirrors Miles’ growth--bursts of electricity balanced by quiet confidence. By the time the story ends, players have watched him grow from an uncertain apprentice to a hero worthy of New York’s trust.</p><p dir="ltr">That focus gives the game a rhythm rarely found in open-world design. It doesn’t ask players to clear endless icons or grind through side missions that feel detached from the narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">Insomniac would later expand the formula again with Spider-Man 2, a bigger, flashier sequel that merged Peter and Miles’ stories into one city-spanning epic. But the lessons of Miles Morales linger.</p><p dir="ltr">The spin-off proved that smaller doesn’t mean lesser. It showed that revisiting a familiar world through new eyes can be as exciting as exploring somewhere brand new. And it reminded players that open worlds don’t need to expand endlessly--sometimes, they just need to evolve.</p>

"Later [I learned] it was the blast, the RPG. When I was in the hospital, I decided to look down. That's when I realized that my left arm, my dominant arm, was shorter."</p><p>Green worked with Activision to create the DLC for Black Ops 7. She said, "This Veterans Day is special to me because I get to give back to my community and give veterans an opportunity to find meaningful jobs by being a part of the Call of Duty Endowment."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4601017-screenshot2025-11-12at9.55.33%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4601017" data-ratio="0.55277777777778" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4601017-screenshot2025-11-12at9.55.33%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4601017"></a><figcaption>Get the Black Ops 7 C.O.D.E.

<p>To kick things off, Super Mario Bros. creator and movie executive producer Shigeru Miyamoto introduced himself and Chris Meledandri, the CEO of Illumination, the studio behind <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. The duo wasted no time, though, immediately kicking to the first full trailer for the film. In it, we get a look at returning characters like Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, and Toad, alongside our first looks at new additions in the form of Rosalina and Bowser Jr.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the new trailer for </strong><em><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </strong></em><strong>below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, the trailer begins on a stormy night. Inside a castle, we see Bowser painting something, and just after placing the finishing touches, he's jump-scared by Luigi. In case you forgot, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2023/04/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-1-upping-the-rest"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, which hit theaters in 2023, ended with Bowser consuming a Mini Mushroom, shrinking him significantly. Since the events of that movie, it seems Mario and Luigi have been keeping a close eye on Bowser by letting him live in his shrunken-down castle within the confines of Peach's castle.&nbsp;</p><p>In this scene, Bowser showcases his latest masterpiece, and of course, it's a totally-accurate-and-not-at-all-exaggerated buff version of himself holding Peach on canvas. We also see that Bowser is working on his anger issues here, but is still struggling with them from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>From here, the scene with Bowser, Mario, and Luigi ends and we cut forward to Peach and Mario on a balcony of Peach's castle in the Mushroom Kingdom, watching a strange phenomenon happen in the sky. Dozens of stars burst through the night sky above them as the duo watches in awe (and maybe a bit of fear ) at what's happening. At this point, the Mario Bros. theme from <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>begins blasting, and we see Peach and Toad jumping through star-shaped portals, blasting through space, diving through watery planets, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In this montage, we see Mario and Luigi on a sandy planet, riding motorbikes, towards a familiar desert pyramid, while Peach is busy kicking some butt on a different planet. After this, we get a look at a seemingly powered-up version of Bowser Jr. before cutting away to Rosalina using her special powers to take down a massive mechanized enemy.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends here, reminding viewers that <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>hits theaters on April 3, 2026.&nbsp;</p><h3>New Cast</h3><p>As you probably predicted, given the movie's title, it's no surprise that Rosalina appears in the trailer. She's <em>the </em>galactic protector after all, and one of the main stars in the Super Mario Galaxy series of games. Meledandri and Miyamoto used this segment of the Direct to debut a new scene of Rosalina reading a special book to her star-shaped friends, the Lumas. After this, Meledandri reveals that none other than Brie Larson (<em>Captain Marvel</em>, <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em>), noted Nintendo superfan, is voicing Rosalina.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside that new casting announcement, Meledandri attempted to reveal the voice of Bowser Jr., but Bowser's voice actor, Jack Black, crashed the Direct to do it himself. And the voice of Bowser Jr. is none other than Benny Safdie (<em>Oppenheimer</em>, <em>The Curse</em>, and director of <em>Uncut Gems</em>). We got a quick scene of Bowser Jr. here showing the beloved/infamous Koopa throne heir-to-be donning a more traditional look (versus the purple-glowing, powered-up version in the trailer).&nbsp;</p><p>After that, the Direct ended with Miyamoto and Meledandri expressing their excitement for the film, with the latter noting Illumination is weeks away from putting the final touches on the movie. Miyamoto closed out the Direct by urging viewers to check out the Nintendo Today app for more information, but at the time of this writing, only the Direct has been posted there.&nbsp;</p><h3>New Poster</h3><p>Outside of the Direct, Nintendo and Illumination revealed a new poster for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>that you can see below:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Embark Studios has announced it has been quietly testing out duo queue in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> this week, and has now announced the option officially on its official website for pairs of pals to enjoy at their leisure.</p>
<p>In the official post, Embark explains how it'll work as such: "Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritise Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritise Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100 percent guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own."</p>
<p>In addition to the duo queue rollout, Embark Studios has lowered the price of in-game cosmetics after community feedback. These price changes will go into effect starting tomorrow on the 13th November. For anyone who had already purchased in-game cosmetics, the difference between the old price and the new one will be refunded to their accounts.</p>

</figure>
<p>The team at Embark also emphasised a lack of pay-to-win in its upcoming premium raider decks. For those who don't know, raider decks are essentially progress paths in which players can unlock cosmetics and in-game items through completing challenges. At the moment, there's just a free one. However, paid options will be coming in the future, leading some to worry about potential pay-to-win concerns.</p><p>To this, Embark noted the following: "Gameplay Items are only in free Raider Decks. To help you along the way as a new Raider, we have included some Gameplay Items in the free Raider Deck, which can be unlocked via progression. There are no Pay to Win items in the premium Raider Decks. The focus for premium Decks are based on cosmetics and convenience."</p>

            <p>Nintendo has finally shown the first official trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, its follow-up to the phenomenally successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>
<p>The trailer was included as part of a short Direct stream, introducing both Rosalina and Bowser Jr, as well as their respective voice actors Brie Larson and Benny Safdie.</p>
<p>So what little nuggets of Nintendo magic were we able to spot so far?</p>

<figcaption>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct 11.12.2025<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>The trailer begins with Bowser painting in his castle, though he's in miniature form after consuming a mini mushroom at the end of the previous film. Seeing Bowser with a paintbrush seems to be foreshadowing the inclusion of his offspring later in the trailer.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A closer look at his paintings shows various scenes and characters from across the Mario series, including a Boo, the smiling flowers from Yoshi's Island, and his iconic Koopa Clown Car.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for his "masterpiece for Princess Peach", it's quite something.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We then cut to Mario and Peach witnessing shooting stars over the castle, seemingly instigating the events of the film and hinting at its cosmic, outer space themes.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Peach and Toad are then seen using an iconic star portal from the Mario Galaxy games to shoot into space. Here they fly through a small spherical world, just like the games, this one a water-filled environment with Bloopers.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>
 


</figure>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After this we see two characters cloaked in red and green (presumably Mario and Luigi) on motorbikes in a desert. While this may be a nod to Mario Kart, they're then seen leaping over dunes towards an inverted pyramid taken straight from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s Sand Kingdom. So it's not just Galaxy that's inspired the events of the film.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next is Peach battling a load of Ninji's with her umbrella in some sort of neon-lit casino arena, which could be a reference to both Ninji Jump Party in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and the Sirena Beach Casino in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>. Ninjis were first seen in Super Mario Bros. 2, before appearing in multiple games in the series since.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And here he is! Bowser Jr, complete with his Super Mario Sunshine paintbrush, will seemingly be the main villain in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie on a quest to rescue his father. Except he has a more futuristic appearance from his Super Mario Bros. Wonder appearance, including metallic armour, a robotic voice, and a paintbrush that morphs into a morning star on a chain.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the title card, an extra scene reveals Rosalina, the cosmic heroine from the Mario Galaxy games. She sneaks out of Princess Peach's castle and is immediately confronted by Megaleg, a robotic boss familiar to Mario Galaxy players. Rosalina then battles the robot using star magic similar to those portals seen earlier. She's pretty badass. What's more, the music includes a melodic nod to the Gusty Garden Galaxy at the very end.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That marks the end of the trailer, though the Direct showed a little more. Introducing Brie Larson as Rosalina's voice actor, we see a scene with Rosalina sat reading a storybook to a bunch of colourful Lumas. She begins to read a story about Peach, though the Lumas chant for the "one about the plumbers" instead. Both Mario Galaxy games (at least now thanks to the new Switch versions) include scenes of Rosalina reading from her storybook to chronicle events prior to the games' plot, so this scene references that.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A final scene introducing Bowser Jr shows his more familiar getup, so it'll be interesting to see where his futuristic outfit comes from.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that's it for now. There's no Yoshi just yet, though his inclusion is widely anticipated.</p>
<p>What's more, Illumination's Chris Meledandri hinted the film will have an "incredible range of characters…many for the first time, from iconic favourites to deep cuts that longtime fans will recognise". So who else are you hoping to see pop up in the film?</p>
<p>And most importantly: where is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-is-birdo">Birdo</a>?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Thanks/No Thanks For Telling Me About Buckshot Roulette, Everyone]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thanks-no-thanks-for-telling-me-about-buckshot-roulette-everyone.1351153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Back when I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/cloverpit-demo/"><em><u>CloverPit</u></em></a>, a bunch of readers said “Oh, this is just <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>,” a game I hadn’t heard of. Over the weekend, while piling my Steam library with games I was excited to play once I stopped building a <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>new website</u></a>, I tossed <em>Buckshot Roulette</em> in there. I finally got the chance to play a bit, and yeah, it definitely presses some of those same dark, complicated brain buttons as <em>CloverPit</em>.</p><p><em>Buckshot Roulette</em> is a 2023 Itch.io game that came to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steam</u></a> in 2024. In single-player mode, you’re sat across from a dealer in a grimy room. The dealer loads a variety of live or blank shotgun shells into a gun, and you take turns passing it back and forth deciding whether to shoot yourself or your opponent. Shooting yourself with a blank gives you another turn; shooting the other person (or shooting yourself) takes a point off health. The game progresses over rounds, with your health refilling in the first two before the third goes into “sudden death;” if you die here, you lose and start over.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEGxnpGqEaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Buckshot Roulette - Steam Release Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>You get items before some rounds, which can help you craft whatever passes for a strategy in this game. The magnifying glass will tell you whether a live or blank is in the chamber, the handcuffs force your opponent to skip a turn, and the knife increases the gun’s damage. Your opponent, of course, also gets items, and in my single-player games I’ve found there to be a wonderful sense of dread as I watch the dealer busy themselves with theirs, knowing something bad is about to happen to me but being unable to stop it.</p><p>Beating single-player for the first time unlocks an endless mode, and there’s also a multiplayer mode that I haven’t been able to check out yet but have enjoyed watching YouTube videos of. Playing the game with friends seems like a fun/terrible social experience, where playing solo has, like <em>CloverPit</em>, exposed all the grossest wiring of my brain when it comes to the appeal of gambling and chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Both games lay bare the fantasy of making your own luck and precisely where strategy lies when it comes to gambling. They both <em>have</em> strategy; I’d posit <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>’s is a bit easier to employ than <em>CloverPit</em>, given your more limited options and the math that undergirds it. But at the end of the day, you’re still at the mercy of chance in both games–and in both games, I am absolutely certain that I can be totally in control, that I’m on a streak or that the odds hate me, that everything is laden with meaning and portents and that way more is going on than just me sitting alone in whatever dismal virtual room clicking buttons.&nbsp;</p><p>Both games’ aesthetics seem to want to highlight how <em>gross</em> this all is, with their jagged art styles and abrasive music. But at the same time, they fully indulge in the thing they’re criticizing. Playing them both, I ask myself if I’m <em>really</em> playing them ironically or from a distance, if I’m engaging in some kind of intellectual exercise or just mashing the same buttons that led to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>loot box regulation</u></a> or dunks on <a href="https://defector.com/everybody-stand-down-new-yorker-columnists-child-doesnt-care-about-sports-gambling?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sports betting</u></a>. And given that neither game is <em>actually</em> gambling, does that make it better–can you have the pleasure without the pain?--or does that make it worse–with none of the consequences of real gambling to stop me, am I just training neural pathways that <em>could</em> lead me down those roads?&nbsp;</p><p>Neither <em>CloverPit</em> or <em>Buckshot Roulette</em> necessarily want to answer those questions, putting themselves out there for you to wrestle with. They’re interesting experiments, finding me at a time where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/814111/unfair-flips-speedrunning?ref=aftermath.site"><u>other</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good/"><u>developers</u></a> are <a href="https://aftermath.site/qup-esports-universal-paperclips/"><u>playing</u></a> with similar ideas of how we engage with randomness and what it does to our heads. They’re also both <em>really </em>fun, even if what that fun is unsettles me if I look at it too closely. I'm impressed that such a little game has so much going on, that it lets me bring so much of myself to it. Thanks for the moral crisis, readers.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

			<p>The date today is November 12, 2025, and besides the fact that it is the day after November 11 and before November 13, it's also the 5th anniversary of the release of the PlayStation 5. This past September, on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">30th anniversary of the launch of the original PlayStation console</a>, Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella shared a few interesting sales charts about the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles ever. As a follow-up, he's done the same for the 5th anniversary of the PS5, and the results are fairly similar.</p>



<p>Similar in the sense that when it comes to the best-selling games on the PS5 in the US, Call of Duty appears on the charts three times within the top-five best-selling games on the PS5 since it launched. Piscatella also shared that compared to other PlayStation consoles in the same time span, the PS5 is the 2nd fastest-selling console in the US in PlayStation history, trailing behind the PlayStation 2.</p>







<p>Of the top ten best-selling games on the PS5, three of them are Call of Duty titles, three of them are annualized sports games, and three of them are first-party, PlayStation Studios titles. Two of those games are Insomniac titles, which is arguably more just a result of the fact that Insomniac is one of the few PlayStation Studios teams that has released new games in the last five years, and not just remasters or remakes.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how this list changes, if it does at all, by the end of the PS5 generation. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo showcased its special Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct event today, which, ultimately, only confirmed a few things we didn't already know, like how it would've been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">a better surprise that Bowser Jr. is in the film if that hadn't leaked ahead of time</a>. That's not to say there wasn't anything worth checking out, since we did get new insight into the plot of this film, and two major new cast members were revealed.</p>



<p>Of course, we also got a new trailer for the film, which showed off more of Illumination's impressive animation work. While the first Super Mario Bros. Movie focused on introducing Mario and Luigi to the Mushroom Kingdom, the Super Mario Galaxy Movie picks up right where the first one left off, with Bowser still shrunk after eating a shrinking mushroom, and life in the Mushroom Kingdom relatively peaceful.</p>



<p>Enter Bowser Jr., played by Benny Safdie, who you'd recognize from his work in Oppenheimer and Uncut Gems, who is on a quest to save his father from what essentially looks like a small prison he's being kept in, so Mario and Luigi can keep an eye on him.</p>



<p>In a currently unexplained way, Bowser Jr.'s attempted rescue of his dad leads to a galaxy-spanning journey, which is also where Princess Rosalina comes in, played by Marvel star Brie Larson.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Brie Larson's involvement isn't exactly a surprise, considering her outspoken love for Nintendo and involvement in multiple Nintendo Switch commercials. If anything, it's a shock that she wasn't already involved in the first film, and had to wait for the second one to come around to get a role.</p>



<p>Benny Safdie is a more intriguing choice, and from the sounds of it, will be a fun one as he steps into the junior Koopa feet of Bowser Jr., heir to his father's throne.</p>



<p>The trailer also includes a few hints at what's to come, like confirmation that the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey will be one of the locations the film visits on its journey. Hopefully, since this is a galaxy-spanning film, we'll get to see multiple locations from across Super Mario games' history.</p>



<p>In the meantime, there are still a few big questions left unanswered, namely, who is playing Yoshi?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A tablet can come in handy when your phone feels too small, but you don’t want to carry your laptop around. These screens are great for being productive on the go, and even keeping your kids entertained (for a while at least). That said, you don’t always have to spend $300+ to get something that’s powerful enough to get through your busy days, yet easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Thankfully, early Black Friday deals are already rolling in, making it easy to grab a high-end option without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">Amazon has now dropped the price of the 11-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ to just $149, after a massive 32% off its regular price of $220.</a> This deal applies to the Graphite model, but if you prefer the Silver version, that one’s just a dollar more at $150. The only catch? It’s already selling fast, and stock might run out before the deal ends. It’s best to grab it while it’s still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Portable, Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This sleek tablet comes with an 11-inch screen that’s big enough to open multiple windows side-by-side without feeling cramped. The WUXGA display (1920 x 1200) pushes vibrant, detailed visuals that bring content to life, whether you’re playing a game or watching a TV show. The 90Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure you experience exceptional clarity in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>Of course, good visuals are only half the experience. You will also enjoy quality sound with the tablet’s quad-speaker setup with Dolby Atmos support. Every movie dialog (even the whispers) will come through clearly, kids’ songs are going to sound better, and even video calls will feel more natural. Speaking of video calls, there’s a solid front camera as well, which makes you look your best while catching up with family and friends.</p>



<p>For power, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ packs a Snapdragon 695 processor, paired with <strong>4GB of RAM </strong>and<strong> 64GB of internal storage</strong>. That’s enough for some light multitasking, plus storing all your important files or media content in one place. If you ever need more space, you can always expand it up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>It supports Smart View, which means you can cast your screen to a Samsung TV whenever you want to enjoy a bigger viewing experience, easily. And finally, the battery also lasts all day, plus charges back up quickly when you need it.</p>

In the trailer, we get new looks at returning characters like Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, and Toad, alongside our first look at Rosalina and Bowser Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Direct, Nintendo and Illumination, which is creating the movie, revealed that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-casts-brie-larson-as-rosalina-benny-safdie">Brie Larson will voice Rosalina and Benny Safdie will voice Bowser Jr</a>. In the trailer, we get to see and hear both of these new (to the movie franchise) characters in action. As <em>the </em>galactic protector, Rosalina is quite adept at tackling any challenge before her with her special wand and star friends known as the Lumas – we get to see her use that wand against a strange mechanical enemy and read a special book to her Lumas. As for Safdie's Bowser Jr., we see the character's more traditional look alongside a seemingly powered-up (perhaps mechanical) version of Bowser's child.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the new trailer for </strong><em><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </strong></em><strong>below:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, alongside looks at returning and new characters, this trailer also shows us glimpses of the planet-hopping adventure the Mario Bros. crew will go on in the movie, highlighting that even Peach and Toad will do some galactic travel.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/reach-review-a-leap-ahead-for-vr-action-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reach-review-%E2%80%93-a-leap-ahead-for-vr-action-games.1351111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When you set up a whole new studio and team specifically to create new and better ways to play VR games, you’d better deliver. The aim for nDreams Elevation’s first game was to transfer the classic action-adventure gameplay feel found in games such as Tomb Raider and&nbsp; Uncharted and make it work in VR. The issue for high action in VR has always been keeping you comfortable and without motion sickness, but Reach has put those worries aside, delivering on that classic action-adventure feel with ease.</p>
<p><iframe title="REACH OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER | PS VR2, Meta Quest, and Steam | nDreams Elevation" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3E9uUjL63oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a reluctant hero Rosa, a stuntwoman who has returned to her hometown to film a new movie.&nbsp; After two fairly short introduction levels she finds herself in a magical underground world populated by living statues who are intent on making it to the surface and destroying the human race.&nbsp; Teaming up with Atlas, a friendly statue, and a Destiny-like Ghost companion, you have to jump, swing, and shoot your way through the world while solving fairly simple physical puzzles. You can play stealthily, sneaking around the corridors and ripping the spines out of unsuspecting statues, or go in all guns blazing. The plot is fairly generic without any major surprises, but it does the job.</p>


<p>You are armed with a crossbow that can fire four different types of shot including ice and fire, a grappling hook mechanism and a Captain America’ style shield. The latter is particularly fun, summoned by a hand gesture and then flung at enemies’ heads, ricocheting around the room and returning to your hand when activated. If you are sneaky, you can also steal the guns off the statues, but all your main weapons have an extra function; You can climb up arrows stuck in walls or jump on a shield wedged in a gap.&nbsp; It’s a shame that your bow requires both hands as it would have been great to take some shots whilst hanging from a ledge by one hand – proper action hero stuff!</p>


<p>I played a couple of hours of Reach at a preview event, including the first two missions. At that time I was taking things quite slowly, but when I fired up the game to review it was only at the end of the first mission that I realised I had speed-run the entire thing, chaining jumps together and flinging myself around like an acrobat. All the behind-the-scenes trickery that nDreams Elevation created really works.</p>
<p>One of their improvements is so obvious that it’s a wonder no one else had thought of it: you have to swing your arm to jump. It’s exactly what you would do in real life, using your arms to gain momentum, and a great extension of the motion controls in other titles where you pump your arms to walk around. It gives a greater connection&nbsp;between your body and the movement, tricking your brain into thinking you are jumping, thus allowing you to leap from platform to platform to ladder to zipwire in one smooth sequence without motion sickness.</p>

<p>The game also simulates your whole body movement rather than just your arms and head and this gives you a feeling of presence and weight, allowing for smoother transitions. For example, when reaching the top of a ladder, you can lean forward and instinctively know when to mantle up to the platform.&nbsp; The sense of freedom and physicality, the climbing, jumping, grappling and zip-lining feel all intuitive and immersive.</p>
<p>Reach has some fairly decent graphics, although some areas do seem a little empty, it’s not going to give Horizon VR anything to worry about, but that is on purpose. You are meant to be belting it through this game and too many extra details would distract you from the parkour.</p>

<p>I have two major issues with the game, one specific to myself and one in general. Firstly, there is no way to set your in-game height, and I would guess Rosa is about 5’6″, a foot shorter than me, so I did feel like I had a compressed spine all the time I was playing. My second issue is probably down to the game being developed for multiple VR platforms. After all the work that has gone in to making you feel like you really are in Rosa’s world, all of which works, you regularly get hit with black loading screens that drag you right out of the game. There is absolutely no need for those on a PS5, the levels are not big, but I would assume the limitations of other headsets forced the developers hand.</p>

<p>Out of this world</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Illumination have revealed the first proper trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, and it's a galactic banger.</p>
<p>We get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosaline, plus a whole bunch of new locations based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>? Yep, there's representation from both games here.</p>
<p>New cast members have also been confirmed, with Brie Larson (<strong>Captain Marvel</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>) taking on the role of Rosalina, and Benny Safdie stepping into the shoes of Bowser Jr. If that name doesn't quite ring a bell, Safdie has acted in a number of projects, but is perhaps more notable for is directorial work on <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> and <strong>The Smashing Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the trailer also reiterates the planned release window of <strong>April 2026</strong>, which isn't too far off at this point. Like the first movie, it seems more than likely that we'll get another Direct / trailer at some point in the next few months or so, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>And if you're interested in seeing the whole Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct, you can watch the Shigeru Miyamoto-hosted video below:</p>

<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160454/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are seemingly on a mission to bring as many <strong>Yakuza</strong> games to the Switch 2 in as short a time span as possible. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> joining <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>, we’re already at three within five months of the console’s release. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> next February will make it four. Damn, Sega – keep going!</p>
<p>Kiwami 2 was originally released in 2017, and while that seems like a lifetime ago at this point (just ask <strong>Metroid</strong> fans), the underlying Dragon Engine makes it comfortably the most technically demanding entry on Switch 2 yet. I’m thrilled to confirm, then, that it’s a joyous experience from start to finish. It’s easily one of the best entries in the series, one that comes dangerously close to the highs of Yakuza 0.</p>
<p>So once again, you step into the shoes of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu who, after a short period of peace and quiet, is brought back into the criminal fold following a growing conflict between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance. Kiwami 2 features the familiar sights and sounds of the Tokyo-inspired Kamurocho, but a good chunk of the game also takes place within the Osaka-inspired Sotenbori.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160455/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wielding the might of the Dragon Engine, which made its debut in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life">Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</a>, both main locations look absolutely incredible. Neon lights shine brighter than ever, buildings reflect accurately off Sotenbori’s main river, and streets are filled to the brim with well-rendered residents going about their day.</p>
<p>By keeping the literal size of these cities in check, RGG Studio is able to pack them with things to see and do, and in combining this with realistic diegetic sounds like distant arcade music and the casual chatter of NCPs, it makes for one of the most vividly alive settings I’ve ever seen in a game. Take note, Game Freak.</p>
<p>The notable improvement to visuals does come with one potential drawback: 30fps performance. Both Yakuza 0 and the original Kiwami reach a stable 60fps with the previous engine on Switch 2, and while moving directly from Kiwami to Kiwami 2 did make the drop much more apparent at first, it didn’t bother me at all once I actually started playing properly.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160453/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It remains stable throughout, even during effects-heavy action sequences, and the improvements elsewhere more than make up for any initial disappointment. Not only does Kiwami 2 look <em>much</em> better, but transitions into fights and (most) interior locations are seamless, making for a significantly more modernised experience.</p>
<p>General gameplay is a familiar mix of exploration, minigames, and melee combat, with a sprinkling of RPG mechanics thrown in for good measure. Yakuza games have a remarkable ability to distract you from completing your primary objectives at every turn. So one moment you might be laying the smackdown on a formidable boss before watching the dramatic aftermath in a couple of sumptuous cutscenes, and two minutes later you’ll somehow find yourself in the men’s toilets having a literal peeing contest. It’s absurd, and I love it.</p>
<p>That’s just one of the <em>many</em> minigames. You can play darts, win prizes on claw machines, master mahjong, sing karaoke, clean up in a game of poker, and more. A true highlight was stumbling upon a Club Sega arcade joint, which houses fully playable versions of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_2">Virtua Fighter 2</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/virtual_on_cyber_troopers">Virtual On: Cyber Troopers</a>.</p>

<p>The authenticity really helps the overall setting sing, and you can also buy real-life beverages like The Yamazaki and Hibiki, or dine in at a real-world eatery like Zuboraya. Stocking up on food and drink is encouraged to maintain your health, but I hardly need the excuse to browse Kiwami 2’s extensive, hunger-inducing range.</p>
<p>Watching your health is vital, mind you, since you’ll be getting into fights left, right, and centre. Naturally, a lot of scraps will take place as you progress through the main story, but the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are also riddled with gangs of thugs who won’t hesitate to start wailing on you at any given moment.</p>
<p>Unlike previous entries, Kiwami 2 doesn’t feature multiple fighting styles to switch between. You’ve only got the one here, but as someone who never really bothered with the Beast style much in the first Kiwami, I appreciate the more streamlined approach. You still have melee weapons like knives and baseball bats, while upgrades add whole new abilities to your arsenal.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160458/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each fight grants a bunch of experience points, which you can spend on general stats, battle skills, heat actions, and life skills. Overall, it feels far less fiddly than previous entries' overwhelming upgrade paths, and you’ll find yourself purchasing upgrades at frequent intervals. Once you’ve added a few new moves to your belt, powered up your heat meter, and unleashed a blistering flurry of combos, you’ll feel just like a dragon.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would matter one lick if it weren’t for the story at Kiwami 2’s core. It’s full of wild twists and turns, but the exceptional performances from Takaya Kuroda, Aya Hisakawa, Satoshi Tokushige, and more wonderful voice actors help keep everything grounded. RGG Studio's team are masters at storytelling, and they're only getting better with each new entry.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re particularly fond of the fan-favourite Goro Majima, you can play as the character once again with a short but sweet side campaign accessed via the main menu after a certain point in the main game. This covers what Majima was up to after the first game, and it proves to be a strong, albeit inessential detour.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a wonderful experience on Switch 2. The improved visuals and streamlined mechanics make for a delightful gameplay experience bolstered by a compelling narrative at its core.</p>
<p>There are so many ridiculous minigames to keep you entertained, and exploring Kamurocho and Sotenbori remains enjoyable five or even fifty hours into the game. It stands alongside Yakuza 0: Director's Cut as one of the finest entries in the series.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-40%E2%80%B3-fire-tv-already-matches-last-year%E2%80%99s-black-friday-price-practically-free-right-now.1351087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re in mid November which can only mean one thing. It’s time to lock in and get done all your holiday shopping for your friends, family, and loved ones. While we’re still a couple short weeks out from the big savings events of the season happening over Black Friday weekend and the following Cyber Monday, that doesn’t mean you can find some excellent deals right now in the meantime. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5477/">Amazon happens to have its 2-Series 40-inch Fire TV on sale for a solid 40% off.</a> That actually takes the price down from it’s starting level of $250 down to just $150. You end up saving an even $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Now let’s set the expectations when it comes to this display. This isn’t some expensive OLED TV which can go for multiple thousands of dollars. You can still get a picture that’s fairly big, displays in high definition, and has a wide color gamut without having to take out a second mortgage on your home. This 1080p 43-inch TV has support for HDR 10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Audio which can further enhance your image and sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5477/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>Fire TV let’s you keep all of your entertainment in one place. You’ll have access to apps for all your favorite streaming services ranging from Netflix to Prime Video to Disney Plus, so long as you have the proper subscription. At a default, with no extra charge, you have access to a ton of free streaming content as well. Watch TV show episodes and movies for free over on various apps like YouTube, Tubi, Pluto TV, and more.</p>
<h2>Alexa-enabled</h2>
<p>Being an Amazon product, the remote for this TV is built with Alexa voice support. All you need to do is just hold down the button of the little microphone and speak into it the title of the movie or TV show you’re looking to watch. That’s significantly easier than trying to type out the entire phrase, “<em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em>,” one letter at a time on those on-screen keypads. Just speak it into the remote and you’re there.</p>



<p>The TV is equipped with two standard HDMI inputs, allowing you to connect to a gaming console, cable box, or satellite service provider. One of the inputs is HDMI ARC which allow for pairing with audio equipment like a soundbar for advanced sound.</p>
<p>Speaking of sound, this Fire TV even supports wireless Bluetooth listening. You can pair a set of headphones for private listening when you don’t want to disturb others you share the space with.</p>
