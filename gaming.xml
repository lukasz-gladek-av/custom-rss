            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-charming-new-gba-classics-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online.1301535/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced it will add two more GBA classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of cutesy platformers and puzzlers, you're in for a treat.</p>

<p>Following on from the addition of other Game Boy Advance titles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a>&nbsp;</em>to the service this year, the two games being added in this latest update are puzzler&nbsp;<em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>and platformer&nbsp;<em>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</em>.</p>

<p>The former was originally released for the GBA in 2005 (in the US, at least), subsequently receiving a re-release for the Wii U in 2014. Like other&nbsp;<em>Mr. Driller&nbsp;</em>games, you'll need to dig through a series of differently-colored blocks to emerge victorious, and there are many blocks with different properties with which you'll need to contend.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mr.-driller-2-game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=iMAQqZRT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mr.-driller-2-game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=OoiY1JyO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>is one of two GBA games being added to Nintendo Switch Online soon.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>began its life as an arcade game; it was a launch title for the GBA in Japan, but it didn't come to Western shores until a few years later, launching in Europe in 2004 and the USA in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second GBA game in this update is the underrated platformer <i>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</i>, which, rather than being a spinoff of the main&nbsp;<em>Klonoa&nbsp;</em>series, serves more as a side story to the core games.</p>

<p>It plays very similarly to previous&nbsp;<em>Klonoa&nbsp;</em>titles, although since it's a Game Boy Advance game, you might not find it quite as impressive on the technical side as its bigger console brethren. Still, it's just as cute and endearing as the regular&nbsp;<em>Klonoa&nbsp;</em>games are.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer that shows off both&nbsp;<em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Both of these GBA games are being added to the Nintendo Switch Online service on September 25th, but as usual when it comes to Game Boy Advance additions, you'll need the Expansion Pack addon to play them. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hades 2</em> has its long-awaited 1.0 release later this month, but if you haven’t played the first game yet, you should really start warming up with that first. Supergiant Games’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">2020 GOTY contender</a> is currently on sale to celebrate its five-year anniversary. You can grab <em>Hades 1</em> for less than most meals on the McDonald’s menu. Your heart will be better off, too.</p> <p>The action-RPG roguelike is about the son of Hades trying to escape the underworld and reach Mount Olympus. Players have to choose between competing upgrades and survive isometric bullet-hell battles to do so. A range of weapons and buildcrafting options, combined with incredible art and rich worldbuilding, make it an all-around exceptional game. Part classic arcade beat ’em up, part engrossing visual novel, <em>Hades</em> has something for everyone. Maybe that’s why it inspired Supergiant to make its first sequel.</p> <p><em>Hades</em> is normally $25, but right now it’s 75 percent off until September 30 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hades-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOorNEZO4qZlxH5rvIgBR45p8YVScR59SD9KL2Tl8FfcUrFXtCTbS">the Switch eShop</a>. At just $6.24, it’s a steal. If you don’t already own it on Switch 2, now’s the time.</p>

 <p>Now I know what you’re thinking. Why buy<em> Hades 1</em> when <em>Hades 2</em> is just around the corner? <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272">The sequel launches September 25</a> after years in Early Access and is, on the surface at least, simply more <em>Hades</em>. But it tells a completely different story, stars a hero that’s more ranged-centric than the first game’s Zagreus, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575">definitely harder overall</a>.</p> <p>Is this a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> situation? Based on my time with the Early Access version I’m not ready to say, but new players will definitely benefit from warming up in the first game and getting a feel for the flow and decision-making that comes with selecting between all of the different upgrade paths. And hell, by the time you actually finish <em>Hades 1</em>, maybe the second game will be on sale for $6.29 too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ship was on fire. My crewmates were off-ship capturing the nearby defense cannons to aid our fleet, and I was fighting half a dozen Legion vessels. I wasn’t sure how long I could last solo, but if they didn’t get me, the fire would. I pointed the bow of our C-3 Catamaran away from the fighting, locked in the ship’s cruise control, and got up from the pilot’s seat, and turned to find most of the top level covered in flames. The lower decks weren’t much better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed the closest extinguisher and sprinted across the ship, putting out the inferno as fast as I could. Fortunately, the Legion ships gave me a few moments to breathe. When the fire was smothered, I turned us around. The cruise control had taken the Catamaran much farther away from the action than I anticipated, and the rest of my crew needed help. Our core integrity still wasn’t great; a few good hits, and we’d be just one more of the floating hulks we’d passed to get to this sector. But I didn’t have the materials for repairs. Not a great hand, but you play the cards you’re dealt. I angled the Catamaran’s nose toward the cannons – and the Legion ships surrounding them – kicked on the boosters, and prayed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Jump Space Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jump Space excels in the moments when you and your crew are surviving by the skin of your teeth, putting out fires, repairing damaged thrusters, making ammo as fast as your weapons can fire it, and fighting attackers that have just jumped in to ruin your day. The successes are exhilarating; the failures, usually at least memorable. But like a run that ends early and leaves you wondering what might have been, the limits of the early access version become apparent on just about every mission. There’s no doubt that the potential for an epic game is here; it’s just a matter of whether or not it will be reached, and how long it’ll be until then. For now, though, Jump Space is definitely worth at least a short trip through the stars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are technically characters in Jump Space, but aside from your ship’s AI Iris and Buddy (an adorable robot that accompanies you on missions if your crew is shorthanded), I couldn’t tell you their names without looking them up. They’re there to give you quests and rewards and provide some flavor about the backstory of a robot uprising that drove humanity into exile between missions, but once you select a mission from the galaxy map and head out, they quickly disappear from memory.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jump Space excels in the moments when you and your crew are surviving by the skin of your teeth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each mission consists of a roguelike-style run of several jumps, each chosen from a few paths on your route from your base to where you need to go. Each choice closes some options and opens others, and each individual jump offers different rewards including components for your ship, fragments of maps that open up new parts of the galaxy, or artifacts that provide upgrades for that run, such as restoring health when your crew is close together or dealing damage absorbed by your ships’ shields back to attackers. Choosing the right route is crucial to maximize the stuff you’ll need for that run, but also what you’re looking to bring back to the hanger as a permanent get, so it’s usually a decision you’ll want to take a moment to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every jump also brings its own trials, whether you’re navigating the wrecks of other ships and avoiding a solar flare from a nearby star, fighting off a fleet of Legion ships patrolling the sector, or simply exploring an uninhabited sector and scavenging the floating hulks around you for supplies before moving on. The joy here is in the act of playing, of launching out of your ship into the unknown, flying through space under your suit’s power, using your grapple to pull yourself to a nearby buoy or boarding a ship after you disable it. Mastery allows you to flow from on-foot combat to zero-G flight to piloting your ship or manning its guns smoothly, but there’s also something relaxing about scouring a floating wreck blessedly free of evil robots, too, or simply sharing a pizza you made in the ship’s food processor with your crew. In many ways, Jump Space is an interactive chat room, an excuse to hang out with friends while enjoying a fun little space-themed co-op game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is, until the Legion shows up. Most Legion ships, aside from the missile-barragging Corvettes or “What just hit me?” Snipers, are easy to deal with individually, but the challenge comes from (as their name suggests) their numbers. On foot, things are harder, whether you’re dodging the small spider-bots that scurry up to you before unleashing their flamethrowers or the floating bots that pepper you from range, and everything from bipedal walkers to spider-tanks. Despite how much more difficult the on-foot missions can be, though, they’re not necessarily more engaging. Movement options aside (which aren’t always available because you need either a point to grapple to or a place where you can engage your suit’s jet drive boosters) Jump Space is a pretty standard shooter with pretty standard weapons like shotguns, rifles, and machine guns. If it were just these on-foot fights, it wouldn’t be a notable game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, that’s just one aspect of many, and the best moments combine everything: battling other ships, repelling boarders or leaving half your crew to activate an objective while the others defend your ship from assault, coordinating repairs and who is manning what, spending your limited resources to craft the right thing at the right time, and deciding whether to save scrap for permanent resources when you get back to your hanger or to disassemble it to build what you need right now. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest issue that will hopefully be resolved in future content updates is repetition.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It leads to some fun improvization. In the mission I described in the opening, things got so hectic that I wasn’t even landing the ship to pick up my crewmates when they needed to move between the cannons we were trying to capture and hold; I was just getting close enough that they could grapple to the ship, and then I’d get them close enough to launch themselves to the objective. We didn’t have time for anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest issue that will hopefully be resolved in future content updates, whether it’s on-foot or aboard ship, is repetition. Moving a bunch of batteries, or finding and installing nuclear fuses to power a door is fun the first time, but it gets less fun when you’ve played just a few hours and you can already enter an area and know exactly what the objective will be because it’s what always takes place in that space. The big, run-ending finales which can involve defending a capital ship, activating those cannons, grabbing and ferrying cargo from a downed ship before Legion forces jump into the system, or doing something as simple as playing King of the Hill to establish communications hold their novelty longer because you know what you’re going to get from the mission select screen, and you can avoid one if you’re tired of it. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case for the stuff you’ll have to do on the en-route jumps because your choices can lock you into certain objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the early access of it all. Some of it is cute, like placeholder text that says “Not Made :(“ when an asset isn’t there. Others are less charming, like when Legion ships and bots defy the bounds of Euclidian space and travel unencumbered through walls or asteroids. Now, maybe I missed something in the lore that allows them to do that, but my first thought was, “Man, I wish I could do that!” right up until one of my buddies actually did but got stuck in the ceiling during an on-foot segment, which isn’t as funny as it sounds. Combine that with frequent disconnects and crashes, which often cost my friends progress, and it’s hard to say that Jump Space’s airlocks are fully sealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a little short on features you might expect from a game like this, like being able to buy artifacts for your runs before that run starts (those are teased but not available yet) and the limited number of pilotable ships and customization options. I love being able to slap another railgun on the Catamaran, too, but in about 15 hours it was the only other thing we found that seemed useful. And yeah, more reactors are neat (and playing Tetris with your components to find the right way to power everything is fun), but I still haven’t found one that matches the Split Reactor you start with. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The way Buddy trash-talks the Legion bots after he takes them down with his tiny pistol? Perfection.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the second ship you get, the smaller, faster DT-4 Dart, feels lesser than the Catamaran. I understand the appeal for teams of two or solo players, but as far as we could tell it was lacking basic things like an ammo-refill station, and walking around the outside of the ship was so difficult it was essentially impossible, which is a problem when you need to go outside and fix something. My crewmates hated it so much that we got halfway through a run before abandoning ship and swapping back to our beloved C-3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are plenty of smart decisions, too. The missions scale to player count nicely, and you seem significantly less likely to have major ship malfunctions with a crew of two than a crew of three, when it’s easier to deal with. I also love Buddy, who will not only help out on the ship when there’s just two humans playing, but will actually leave the ship when you’re flying solo to help you out in an on-foot fight. And when he revives you and then gives you a little fistbump, or you hear him trash-talking the Legion bots after he takes them down with his tiny pistol? Perfection. That’s <em>my boy</em> right there. Ride or die. I thought playing solo would be a slog but it was anything but, and that’s all due to Buddy. You can even play soccer in the hangar between missions, complete with dialogue for when you score – or accidentally punt the ball into the nearby canyon.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Co-op Shooters</h3><p>There are a lot of co-op shooters out there. Here are the best ones.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also just a funny game, even when you’re downed because you held an irradiated fuse too long and are begging your friends to save you, or are unable to get off of an exploding ship in time and floating in space, waiting to be revived. And being able to survive a jump, which requires you to be seated, while sitting on the toilet? Talk about boldly going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I have one major complaint beyond the technical stuff and the early access growing pains, it’s how long some missions are. While there are 20-minute missions, many of them start at 40 minutes and you’ll regularly see ones that are an hour plus. That’s a long commitment, especially if you fail and lose most of what you would have gained. I mean, I’m not saying the starting pistol is <em>bad</em>, per se, but when you lose all the other, fancier weapons you had and have to either craft or find them again, you notice. The same is true of a quest you might have to do again. I’m not saying there shouldn’t be friction and failure; I’d just like to see more bite-sized missions when I’m not ready to devote my whole evening to a single run.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">After completing Jump Space’s first early access chapter, trying out both of its ships, and spending around 15 hours traveling the stars I quite like what’s here, even, like your starting ship, it’s still under construction. It’s best enjoyed with a group, in part because co-op games almost always are and also because there are plenty of relatively quiet moments where it’s basically a chill chat room in space. There are some parts of this ship that need a little TLC, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nearly always having fun playing it, even when things got hectic or buggy. Even when things seem all but lost and everything’s on fire, you can still pull it out if you and your crew work together, play smart, and get a little lucky. It’s the kind of moment a game like this has to be able to create if it’s going to work, but even though there’s still work to do to get Jump Space shipshape and add variety to its mission objectives, it’s already proven its concept is a winner.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-space-review-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review.1301517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Live and Learn is more than just one of the best songs in Sonic history; it also feels like a philosophy SEGA has taken to heart with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. I've spent over 35 hours drifting, boosting, and gathering rings across an excellent set of tracks that span Sonic's 34-year history. Minutes effortlessly turned into hours, perfecting my drifting technique, customizing my vehicles, finding the optimal race lines in time trials, and frantically competing with friends to be the Grand Prix champion. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds could have been just another pit stop among a Grand Prix of 2025 kart racers, but instead it put the pedal to the metal and refused to let me take my hands off the wheel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've played my fair share of kart racers over the past few decades starring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review"><u>Sonic</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review"><u>Mario</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review"><u>Crash</u></a>, and plenty of other popular characters. While most are amusing enough, only a few reach that upper pantheon of party games that dominate every get together. With 39 tracks, 24 characters, a nice suite of multiplayer options, tons of challenges to complete, and such a long list of unlockable cosmetics that I still can’t see its finish line, CrossWorlds doesn’t just want to be part of the rotation: it has set its sights on taking the top spot for me and my friends. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CrossWorlds’ racing is quick to pick up thanks to its intuitive and straightforward controls, essentially boiling down to four main actions: accelerate, drift, brake, and use an item. Racing feels great whether you're zipping into shortcuts, landing massive trick combos for a big boost, or nailing a complicated drift that asks you to rapidly change direction on a curvy path. I love how the vehicles feel, as every action fluidly transitions from one into the next, allowing me to chain drifts into jumps into tricks into boosts before launching into another drift to repeat the process again… provided my opponents didn’t send any items my way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting hit with items, messing up a turn, or colliding with a wall definitely cost me a few races, but more often than not they felt more like small speed bumps thanks to the generous placement of boost panels and item capsules on most courses. Those  hits do reduce your ring count, which in turn lowers your top speed, but it rarely took me more than a few seconds to get back on track – and you can reduce that lag time even further depending on how you tune your vehicle. The type of ride you pick will help you eke out extra advantages: Power vehicles are great at shoving other racers around, Handling vehicles make it easier to nail even the trickiest of sharp turns, and the long-awaited return of Sonic Riders' hover boards enabled me to boost like no other when hitting dash panels or using the boosting Wisp items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The headlining feature is the fantastic CrossWorlds mechanic that not only keeps every race interesting but also adds a good amount of depth. Outside of Grand Prix Mode, the second lap of each race almost seamlessly transports everyone to a different course, similar to the dimension jumping done in 2021's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-review"><u>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</u></a>. Warping from the naval scenery of Metal Harbor to the prehistoric Dinosaur Jungle or the incredibly curvy Dragon's Road kept me on my toes every race. This was already my favorite part of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds’ public test demos before my review, but I began to see the true brilliance of it as I put more time into the full game. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The fantastic CrossWorlds mechanic keeps races interesting and adds depth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Different vehicle types excel on different tracks, so making the second lap random adds depth when customizing your ride since you need to consider variables beyond just the course you’ve chosen. My speed-focused vehicle would sing on tracks with many straightaways or boost panels, but would often give up a few positions to racers who tuned for acceleration or handling on tracks filled with constant curves and sharp turns. Since some tracks have portions where you transform into a boat or plane, I found myself making one loadout that could adapt to whatever course ended up as the second lap while still maximizing my potential for the first and final lap on the main track. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Transforming into Flight and Water Forms is as simple as passing through a gate with the matching plane or boat icons. Some transformations are required, such as the Water Form swap at the start of Kraken Bay, while others are optional, like the short Flight Form path on Coral Town if you take a specific branching path, but I was never unhappy to seize the opportunity to change things up – in fact, I would have loved a few more CrossWorlds that gave me extended periods of time in the sky. Flight Form in always handled like a dream, letting you drift vertically to reach items, rings, and boost gates at different elevations. However, a few of the Water Form sections can feel clunky until you figure out the correct rhythm and timing to accelerate, drift, and trick on each course. Vehicles with better handling seem to perform the best during these transformations, so whenever I was having a hard time with a specific section , I would practice in one of those vehicles before returning to my preferred Speed type options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No lap during CrossWorlds feels like another, and though the last lap returns to your original track, there are significant changes during it. Paths that were inaccessible open up, improved item boxes appear with better drop rates for stronger options, and more hazards show up on the course. There are even significant structural changes, like a rocket in Metal Harbor finally launching, which removes two paths and forces everyone into a newly formed spine (or two quarter pipes placed back to back, for those who don't skate). </p><div data-cy="poll-view-trigger"><form action="#" data-cy="poll-content"><fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="poll-question"><legend><p><h2 data-cy="poll-question" id="poll-question">Pick Your Sonic Team</h2></p></legend><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60019" id="answerId60019-label"><span>Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60020" id="answerId60020-label"><span>Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge, E123-Omega)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60021" id="answerId60021-label"><span>Team Rose (Amy Rose, Big, Cream and Cheese)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60022" id="answerId60022-label"><span>Team Eggman (Eggman, Metal Sonic, Egg Pawn)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60023" id="answerId60023-label"><span>Team Chaotix (Espio, Charmy, Vector)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60024" id="answerId60024-label"><span>Team Mystic (Silver, Blaze)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60025" id="answerId60025-label"><span>Babylon Rogues ( Jet, Wave, Storm)</span></label></p></div></fieldset></form></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without the CrossWorlds mechanic, the courses available at launch are all excellent. There are 15 tracks that can only arrive during that second lap, and then 24 main courses for them to show up in, with Coral Town possibly being my favorite. Its looping paths create so many routes that I'm still wrapping my head around which one is the most ideal in time trials – I always found myself changing the route I took depending on my position, character, vehicle, and lap number. Other standouts are classic stages like Market Street, which originated as Rooftop Run in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/12/sonic-unleashed-review"><u>Sonic Unleashed</u></a>, and Radical Highway from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/22/sonic-adventure-2"><u>Sonic Adventure 2</u></a>, the latter of which had me riding the main cables to the top using boost pads to leave my competitors behind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every course feels perfectly tuned with risks and rewards; different routes have different advantages, with some having more rings to help you reach your maximum top speed, while others have more boost panels to provide some speed in the short run in the hopes you will either get far enough ahead not to need the extra rings or at least have enough breathing room to pick them up later. One course that proved to be my Achilles heel: Pumpkin Mansion. The final third of the track is full of giant pumpkins that vanish as you approach, but until the first person reaches them, they hide a section full of sharper turns. They always affected the timing of my drifts until I took the time to memorize their positions through time trials and figured out which paths I should take. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, a kart racer would just be a basic racing game without items to inject a little chaos into them. CrossWorlds has 24 different items that can be pulled from boxes placed all over each course, most of which had me shouting with equal amounts of either excitement or bitterness depending on if I was on the giving or receiving end of each. The iconic Wisps from Sonic Colors are here and offer items in the form of a boost, laser, and drill, which are all helpful to either catch up or extend your lead. These were always welcome as they enabled me to cut across off-road sections and dodge certain attacks, like the punishing Slime and Weight items, if used with proper timing. There are plenty of other cool options as well, like a bomb that grows in size the longer you hold it, eventually becoming a giant wrecking ball that flattens enemies it collides with until its detonation. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Customizing Gadget Panels scratched the min-maxing itch I love in games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tornado quickly became my favorite item because of its ability to negate most incoming attacks while also dealing damage to as many opponents that I could bump into. There is also the Monster Truck, which is sure to be a standout for many, as it transforms your vehicle into a massive machine that flattens opponents, renders you immune to all other items, and allows you to drive off-road without any penalties. By default, you can hold two items at a time, but you can also add the option for a third item or swap between your two items by installing specific upgrades in your customizable Gadget Panel if you really want to lean into the chaos, though I typically leaned toward Gadgets that made me faster, not fiercer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gadgets offer a wide range of extremely impactful bonuses, with more than 30 different options to place on your Gadget Panel before a race. Now, they won’t suddenly craft you a win out of thin air, as your racing skills still remain the most important factor – but when utilized to their maximum potential, Gadgets can be the difference between getting first and fourth place. There are Gadgets to alter your vehicle's stats, improve drift performance, increase the rings you can carry, and grant unique starting items that can't normally be found in races, like a Warp Ring that teleports you on top of the racer just ahead of you, causing you to squish them. The tricky part is figuring out what combination to use; each Gadget Panel has six slots in a two-by-three pattern, and each Gadget requires between one and three slots. Building my Panel became a tiny puzzle with no wrong answers, and it scratched the min-maxing itch I love in games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can prebuild five Gadget Panels and then swap between them before each race, which helps you adjust to specific situations, modifying the base stats of your character and vehicle selection as needed. The roster has nearly all the major characters you’d hope to see from each generation of Sonic: in addition to the usual Team Light and Dark, you’ve got characters from the Sonic Heroes, Riders, Advance, Rush, Colors, and even recent newcomers like Sage from Frontiers. It didn't take long for me to find my favorite in Shadow using a modified Speed-type vehicle, so much so that I used him to clear all eight cups on the Sonic Speed and Super Sonic Speed difficulty (the equivalents of 150cc and 200cc in Mario Kart), only needing minor tweaks outside of regularly adjusting my Gadget Panel. While it was rare for most CPU opponents to give me trouble, a few of the Grands Prix still had the ideal amount of challenge thanks to CrossWorlds’ modular rival system. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before starting each Grand Prix, a random character appears as your rival, and they then act as a supercharged CPU to race against with a challenge level from one to 10, similar to raising the heat level in the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate campaign. Your rival isn't just a CPU racer with better stats, they interject with snarky comments of frustration and glee throughout the races, adding a bit of character to what could have just been a slightly more competent CPU racer. While I haven’t tested every combination of racer and rival, the 20 or so I’ve seen so far all had unique voice lines, which really helped breathe even more life into them. Rivals also behave more intelligently, holding onto defensive items until they need them, taking better racing lines as they drift around corners, and even moving to ensure they take items they expect those behind them to go for. I had to use a not-insignificant amount of retries when racing rivals that were level eight or higher, which is just the right amount of pushback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, CrossWorlds does something I wish every other racing game would do with its in-game currency, Donpa tickets. I would usually net anywhere between 10 and 40 tickets per race, depending on my performance and if I achieved certain feats. That includes things like using the most items, choosing which course is selected for lap two by being in first when reaching the travel ring at the end of lap one, or picking up the series’ iconic red rings. Tickets have a variety of uses, including unlocking various car parts or customization options, increasing your friendship with a character for rewards unique to them, and – my favorite use – retrying a race for better placement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I know what you're thinking: retrying a race is hardly new, but CrossWorlds differs in that you can spend a measly 20 tickets to retry in the middle of a Grand Prix <em>without </em>entirely starting over. So if you get hit with three items on the final turn of the final lap of the final race only to watch your rival and six other racers pass you in the homestretch, you can rewind and try again as many times as you can afford, which cuts down on pointless repetition a lot. Grands Prix also get an exciting and welcome shakeup: instead of racing on a fourth course to end things, the final race is a combination of one lap from the previous three, which tests how well you can adapt to each. That said, I do miss the mission-based Story Mode from Team Sonic Racing, which gave you interesting bonus challenges to accomplish during each stage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Earning tickets feels a bit stingy compared to the cost of unlocking some cosmetics.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also have to dig into the friendship system more, as it will take thousands of races to complete if your goal is to maximize your ranking with each character. Instead of funneling tickets into car parts, you can give them to your favorite characters to receive cosmetics like titles, decals, and alternate costumes in return. These specific unlockables get really expensive really fast: it took me 3000 tickets to earn the first four rewards for Shadow, including one alternate costume, and there is still more for me to unlock. It's clear that SEGA is hoping this will be a system that keeps you drawn in, as with 24 characters, that's a ludicrous number of tickets to unlock everything. I have mixed feelings on this because it gives the most dedicated fans something to chase, but the rate for earning tickets currently feels a bit too stingy when compared to the cost of unlocking some cosmetics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That sticker shock gets even worse when you consider the fact that new characters are already on the horizon, including Hatsune Miku, Joker from Persona 5, and Ichiban from the Like a Dragon franchise, all of which have been announced as upcoming free additions. There will also be characters and tracks for SpongeBob, TMNT, and Avatar: The Last Airbender coming as part of the paid season pass. While I don't necessarily need them since I already have more favorites on the Sonic roster than I do fingers, it is exciting to think of what other characters and tracks could be joining even later down the road. In fact, during <a href="https://youtu.be/9RT6XyOFlTg?si=yA1AU3XwsB_7Y8f0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>my interview with Takashi Iizuka of SEGA at Gamescom</u></a>, they said they plan to support CrossWorlds with new content like this each month for at least the first year after launch, which is an impressive pace given there’s already plenty of unlockables and alternate modes to keep those who blaze through the cups busy at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of those distractions is the Race Park, which consists of six different rule sets, but also allows you to create custom matches to fit whatever you and up to three others want to play locally. These are all available online as well by joining the Friend Match option, though they are limited to one player per console, but it at least allows you to race with groups of up to 12 friends. Currently, every mode boils down to a race for points, but the modified rules change how they play out. In addition to the regular 12-player free-for-all race style, there are also special team modes with rules that grant bonuses for grabbing the most rings, colliding with teammates, using the most dash panels, or landing the most item hits on opponents. These modes were a blast with friends, as they didn't fully rely on who knew the courses the best. It's also something worth playing for a bit, as there are eight different rival CPU teams to take down that unlock special vehicles you can then customize with other parts. The custom rule set is a standout feature here for local multiplayer, too, giving you control over how many races you do back to back, which courses can appear as the Crossworld second lap, what items appear in item boxes, and the speed and difficulty level while racing. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Gotta Go Fast Playlist</h3><p>Jada's Favorite Sonic Games Ranked</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Race Park's one drawback is that, while not necessary, the Gadget Panels can be overly influential to the outcome of races, so it was a let-down that there were no pre-built ones for newcomers. They did have access to everything I had unlocked, but that meant spending time for them to decipher what each one did and figuring out which ones they wanted to set into their Panels. I hope Sega alleviates this with a patch that adds some default Gadget Panels optimized for different vehicle types and playstyles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Race Park, there is also a Time Trial mode that challenges you to race for the best time on both the Sonic and Super Sonic Speed settings. I initially went into Time Trial mode expecting to run through a few tracks just to see what it offered, but it ended up being where I spent more time than anywhere else. After clearing some courses with an A rank (the minimum rank necessary to earn progress towards rewards), I was suddenly hungry for more. Each race, I found myself tinkering with the various car parts and Gadgets, and rewatching my own ghost to see what I could change or where I could improve. What if I save my boost for this turn vs that turn, or what if I sacrifice a bit of my speed to improve my handling stat to nail that hairpin? Before CrossWorlds, I was never a huge Time Trial person, but these hooked me by putting the most enticing thing they could behind them as a reward: my favorite Sonic music to listen to while racing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Sonic game would be incomplete without a banger of a soundtrack, and CrossWorlds rarely fails to impress with its nearly 100 unique tracks. The primary songs are excellent, with popular tracks like Radical Highway, Market Street, Ocean View, and plenty of others all getting the CrossWorlds treatment. And for you Sonic Adventure 2 fans, don't worry, because Escape From the City is here, but you will need to clear all 79 time trials with at least an A ranking to unlock it. All the great artists that have created music for Sonic games here are: Tee Lopes, Tomoya Ohtani, Takahiro Kai, and plenty more. Similar to Sonic x Shadow Generations from last year, unlocking this music does more than just let you listen to them in a jukebox; you can also gather your favorites and slot that playlist (or any of the other six premade albums) as the music for each of the three laps of every race. Possibly the most impressive part of that is how seamlessly they all transition into each other, with each song starting at a different point depending on what lap it plays on. I only wish I could create multiple favorites playlists to have even more control. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Online functionality is simple but effective, and worked well pre-launch.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The last and potentially one of the most critical elements that could decide whether CrossWorlds takes the podium is how online play functions. Ahead of launch, we had a few days to test it and see what it offered. To my enjoyment, it worked as well as I'd hoped, with the caveat that my not-quite-full lobbies were regularly supplemented with CPUs to fill out all 12 spots. Online does have a drawback compared to this year's Mario Kart World since it's limited to just one player per console, but the inclusion of crossplay is a decent trade off, and I saw virtually no lag with my wired connection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Online functionality is simple but effective – you can see other players on your specific console’s friend list, your CrossWorlds in-game friend list, a history of others you’ve raced against, and your fair play points, which is a 100-point gauge that decreases anytime you abandon an online race. This appears to be CrossWorlds’ method for ensuring players who are behind don’t just up and leave the race entirely, which is an appreciated inclusion even if I can’t yet say how effective it will be. Another incentive is that I unlocked even more Gadget options to alter my driving style as I rose through the ranks from E- to an eventual C- during the short prelaunch review window. And while it's too soon to tell how the difference in ranks will affect queue times, I usually found a match in less than a minute during the review period, which has a much smaller pool of players than will be there on launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, it’s great that my custom soundtracks and everything I had earned in offline mode carried over, making me all the more prepared for facing real opponents. The good news is that even fans that want to join online races on day one will still be able to earn all the Gadgets I got offline simply by racing, meaning that each online race will not only move you closer to the Gadgets from higher ranks but also the ones that unlock based on total number of races. However, those players will be at a disadvantage compared to others like myself who spent time earning them before going online, which could also be mitigated with preset Gadget Plates. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle. There are plenty of modes that entertained my friends and me for hours, and CrossWorlds will probably be a regular staple of hangouts as more courses and characters are added over the coming months – though I do wish it had the option for splitscreen when playing online. The titular Crossworld mechanic is an awesome idea that keeps each race fresh, and a great way to potentially turn the tables on opponents thanks to a lengthy list of customization options. While I'm still speeding my way to complete all the challenges, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is one that I know I'll enjoy playing plenty more of in the months to come, crossing the finish line as my new favorite kart racing game of all time.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> set a new gold standard for the genre back in 2020, the mechanics and structure of the isometric action RPG roguelites have become somewhat staid. The maze of rooms, the choice of exits, the array of collectables, the slowly progressing unlockables, the narrative that teasingly develops after every run; let’s face it, most of us could play a new genre entry in our sleep. Sure, we’d die a lot, but it’d be doable. So, it’s refreshing that Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree attempts to do something new with the standard formula, even if it isn’t always successful in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it42ZeHoj2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In what can charitably be described as an unbelievably tedious opening cut-scene, we learn that Towa, a priestess of Shinju, has been tasked with defeating a vile demonic entity dubbed Magatsu. She’s not alone in this endeavour, and is joined by eight guardians on her journey, the Prayer Children, and it is the addition of these guys and gals that mark the game’s first deviation from standard genre form. See, rather than a player character fighting their ways through hordes of demons solo-style, they are joined by a tag-team partner to form a dynamic duo. The first character takes the lead on movement and combat, whilst their colleague, tethered to them by a magical leash, provides defensive and offensive spells.</p>


<p>It’s a neat dynamic, and one that offers a vast variety of tactical options. You are given complete freedom to ally each distinctive member of your team with another, and in whatever combination you prefer. Highlights amongst the wonderfully bonkers Prayer Children include Nishiki, a buff Koi fish, and Bampuku, an enormous fluffy warrior chef cat.</p>


<p>Due to the variety of characters, and the tremendous quantity of build customisations each possible team provides, the loadout options prior to a run can be overwhelming. On the plus side, there’s always a new approach to try when you run up against the inevitable brick wall of a particularly nasty boss. Get the combination of characters and abilities just right – perhaps more by luck and experimentation rather than skilful intention – and it’s undeniably satisfying to wipe the floor with a previously untouchable boss. However, this delight is tempered by the confusion of never quite getting to grips with the unending variables and the complexity of character builds. The poorly designed menu screens don’t help, making even basic skill upgrades a chore to decipher, let alone navigate through.</p>
<p>Indeed, for an action roguelite, there’s almost too much here, of everything. Fully voiced text conversations between characters go on for an absolute age, with everyone talking a lot but saying very little. A lot of waffle then, the video game equivalent of two lovers refusing to be the first to hang up the phone. Meanwhile, the capability to forge your own swords is comprehensive, offering a level of complexity that would make Kingdom Come: Deliverance II envious. However, some of the forging system also seems… oddly pointless. Why bother tinkering with the appearance of your sword, when it ends up in the hands of an isometric character so small that you can barely even see the thing once in combat? Thankfully, you can just get the local blacksmith to do all the forging for you, benefitting from the stat boosts, whilst also saving on a lot of button bashing QTE’s in the process.</p>

<p>If all the mission preparation is an exhausting drag, it’s in the combat itself that Towa truly shines. Fast and responsive, your fighters look gorgeous as they dash around the environment, unleashing some spectacular screen-covering special attacks. Enemies are fairly dumb, though have enough IQ to seek to overwhelm you with their numbers. As such, controlling the space is key, ensuring you can hit as many foes as possible with every attack, whilst leaving yourself room enough to dart away from any reprisal. In a neat addition, each of your lead character’s two weapons begin to dull as you hack away, requiring you to swap over to the alternative weapon on a regular basis to boost your damage, giving the combat a satisfying rhythmic pace.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, despite not being able to directly control your partner, they still have a health bar and take damage, which feels particularly tight when you can’t get them out of the way of an area attack and thus lose your support spells in the process. This tag-team approach also serves to undermine the local co-op, forcing your partner to take on the role of the support character and restricting their role to casting a couple of spells. As such, they can’t take part in combat directly. This is disappointing, as a more focused co-op mode, one that stands apart from the single player campaign’s tag-team mechanics, would definitely have been welcome.</p>
<p>Even for a roguelite, difficulty spikes can be brutal, certain bosses are sword and spell sponges, whilst annoyingly having the ability to near insta-kill your player character. It forces you to get back to base and tinker with your abilities, settings and unlockables to even stand a chance. Thankfully, if it’s all too much, an easy mode takes the edge off the pain of the difficulty somewhat.</p>

<p>Visually, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree is completely gorgeous. Charismatic character design, phenomenal use of colour, and sumptuous environments make this a real looker of a game. Whilst the dialogue remains over-written and dull throughout, the visual storytelling leads you to connect with each and every member of your team. Which makes the most memorable aspect of Towa also likely its most divisive. As you progress in each run, the characters you choose are gradually sacrificed for the greater good and removed from play. This is both emotionally gutting – Bampuku is too cute and cuddly to die – as well as adding an additional challenge to the game; forcing you to vary up your builds, even in the late game, and demanding you continue to experiment to complete future runs. This is a fascinating addition, one that elevates Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree above being merely ‘inspired-by-Hades’ fodder, into something far more demanding and – most thrillingly – unique.</p>

              <p>It’s been a fittingly chaotic launch week for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The cacophony of player feedback ranges from praise for the best new entry in the loot shooter series since <em>Borderlands 2</em> to very loud and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">angry complaints about bugs, crashes, and performance stutters on PC</a>. Even the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions have some weird issues. Gearbox Entertainment now says a second patch to address PC performance is on the way as it also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">investigates problems on console</a>.</p> <p>Not one to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">calmly monitor feedback</a> from atop his 2K Games-funded Ivory Tower, studio CEO Randy Pitchford has been arguing almost nonstop with fans since the game released about whether their gripes about how it runs are legitimate or not. Wit<em>h Borderlands 4</em> sitting at at a mixed rating on Steam with just 65 percent positive reviews, the veteran poster has been handling criticism in classic <em>Borderlands</em> fashion.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Randy is now doing personal tech support for Twitter users and recommending 4x frame gen for a 5080 and telling them to turn off fog which is literally not an option in the game <a href="https://t.co/WzRMiDO8Pt">pic.twitter.com/WzRMiDO8Pt</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s an abridged recap of the post-launch Pitchford timeline:</p> <ul> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650">Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985">Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013">If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">Fun facts: Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">I have personally helped users go from 30FPS to 90FPS+</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">The game is pretty damn optimal</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">Please get a refund from Steam if you aren’t happy with it.</a>”&nbsp;– September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Would you like help tuning with your personal specification?</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Turn down or off the volumetric fog</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968388123534180815">Oops.

Another claiming to be a game industry veteran who was definitely not Pitchford writing under an alias <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1n4ljjl/in_which_i_a_game_industry_veteran_give_sincere/">applauded</a>:” “Randy Pitchford cares. He manically, catastrophically, awkwardly, SINCERELY cares.” I would simply add that <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">this drama is as much a part of <em>Borderlands</em></a> at this point as the bandit psycho masks, terrible Claptrap puns, and glowing ammo hidden in toilets.</p>

 <h2>A second patch to fix <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC is on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shroud's game crashed on Borderlands 4 and cost them all those legendaries RIP😅 <a href="https://t.co/we3m1onoZp">pic.twitter.com/we3m1onoZp</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1968064528052314348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>To help set the record straight or at least cut through the noise a bit, Gearbox released <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">an official statement</a> last night clarifying the team’s ongoing priorities as we approach <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s one-week anniversary. Here are the priorities following an emergency update over the weekend to try to improve optimization on PC:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. <strong>This is our top priority. </strong></li> <li>A Field of View [FOV] slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we’re investigating those with planned updates coming.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The studio also released additional Shift codes for gold keys, including a Break Free Pack, to sweeten the deal with more bonus loot. At least one research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false">has suggested</a> <em>Borderlands 4</em> has already sold over 2 million copies in its first couple of&nbsp; days. Official player stats from Gearbox indicate 764,733,586 total items looted and 4,563,416 deaths by grenade as well as a quarter of all attempted boss fights being failed. I’m sure at least some of them will blame it on not being able to play <em>Borderlands 4</em> at 120fps in 4K.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 007 First Light Preview: License to Thrill</p>
      </div>
<p>Krogh added that gunplay in 007: First Light is designed to feel fluid and responsive, giving Bond a lethal--and mechanically satisfying--option for when his license to kill is activated. In comparison, using guns in IO's Hitman games carried significant risks, as being caught using a weapon would typically result in Agent 47 having to face off against a small army of persistent foes. Guns also had handling characteristics in the game that were authentic to their real-life counterparts, as recoil, bullet drop-off, and physically aiming a weapon made it somewhat impractical to use them when you could simply frame an assassination as a freak accident instead.</p><p>007: First Light launches on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and in case you missed the recent gameplay livestream, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/">14 new things we learned about the James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-has-some-of-the-biggest-levels-that-hitman-dev-has-ever-built/1100-6534477/">how IO built some of its biggest levels yet</a> for its secret agent simulator.

                <p>Borderlands 4 launched on September 12 and it had a massive debut on Steam, eclipsing more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">300,000 concurrent users</a>. The PC edition hasn't been without its issues, though, as players have complained about a range of technical and performance-related problems. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has chimed in as well with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">string of controversial posts on the subject.</a></p><p>Some of the issues are significant enough that Gearbox has already released updates that aimed to improve stability and improvements, while another update is coming today, September 18. "This is our top priority," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/534361794856091855" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer said</a> about addressing the PC issues. The exact contents of the second major PC update have not been announced, however.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>In a separate post, Gearbox said, "We're reading every piece of feedback you share." In addition to the second PC patch, Gearbox said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gearbox-has-heard-your-borderlands-4-complaints-is-exploring-fov-slider-options-on-console/1100-6534735/" data-ref-id="1100-6534735">field of view (FOV) slider option for consoles</a> is now in testing and more information is coming "very soon" about this. Console players have also reported issues with performance, and Gearbox said it's "investigating those with planned updates coming."</p><p>Gearbox said "millions" of people have played Borderlands 4 so far, but publisher 2K Games has not released any official sales numbers as of yet.</p><p>For comparison, 2019's Borderlands 3 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-3-marks-fastest-selling-2k-game-ever-r/1100-6470015/" data-ref-id="1100-6470015">5 million sell-in sales after its first five days</a> to become 2K's fastest-selling game of all time. Sell-in represents copies sold to retailers, sell-through is copies sold to consumers. </p><p>Borderlands 3 went on to sell-in more than 23 million units, but <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands 2 is the best-selling entry in the franchise overall</a> with more than 30 million units sold. Borderlands 4 still has one more major platform to expand onto, and that'll be the Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

<p>If we build them, they will run</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Asobism's tower defence/roguelite/factory sim title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shapehero-factory">ShapeHero Factory</a>, releases on Switch 2 (and 1) today. Hooray!</p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar, this one sees you create an army of robots from a bunch of magical shapes within a factory setting, making for a sweat-inducing puzzle of sorts as you work to get your automation processes up and running before battle.</p>
<p>The twist? You don't actually get to control the robots you make in the ensuing fight here. Nope, it's all about the factory, levelling up through artefacts and creating more and more powerful units to keep on, er, powering through.</p>
<p>Here's some further — and much more official — details and screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mass-Produce Heroes<br></strong>Transport basic shapes from the scroll to assemble your heroes with different combinations. Circles with triangles will make soldiers, while circles and squares make sprites. Add squares to soldiers to give them shields. Perhaps you could create stronger heroes by combining soldiers together…</p>
<p><strong>Hold the Gates<br></strong>The Great Calamity lies deep within the Book of Magic. To bar your heroes from invading, his forces will come to demolish your gates. Maintain the defense while you forge ever deeper into the book. The servants of The Great Calamity each has its own method of attack, so you must choose the right hero for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Factory-Building and Roguelite Elements Make For Endless Possibilities<br></strong>Obtain rewards from a randomly generated list of options after winning battles.<br>
Will you unlock new artifacts (facilities), or upgrade your existing ones?<br>
As you continue making these tricky decisions, you will create a wholly unique factory!<br>
The choices that each author (playable character) will face as well as the types of heroes that they can create are different, so you need to challenge a different “factory-building” each time you play.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to Grow Stronger<br></strong>The enemies are powerful. With the experience points gained at the end of the game, players can use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to grow permanently stronger. This means that the more you play the game, the stronger you will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game left Early Access and went live with version 1.0 just yesterday over on Steam, where it's got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2389040/ShapeHero_Factory/">688 "Very Positive" reviews</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>ShapeHero Factory is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shapehero-factory-switch/">available from the Nintendo eShop for $23.99</a>, or whatever that equates to where you are. It's out on Switch 1, too, for the same price. According to Nintendo's game page, there's no specific upgrade pass for the Switch 1 version (and saves aren't transferable between them). HOWEVER:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the release date, players who own the Nintendo Switch version of this title will be able to obtain the Nintendo Switch 2 version free of charge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to argue with that! We're having trouble finding specific details on what the Switch 2 version does above and beyond Switch 1 - better frame rate and resolution, you'd imagine, especially as the game page suggests a ~400MB file size increase on Switch 2. We'll update you with any details we find out.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dying-light-the-beast-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-tracing-nvidia-reflex/">confirmed</a> the games getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, DLSS Super Resolution, NVIDIA Reflex and Ray Tracing tech, with Dying Light: The Beast and Gears of War: Reloaded headlining today's additions.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches today, after Techland moved the release date up from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">September 19 launch to today, September 18,</a> and its arriving with full support for a suite of NVIDIA technologies. On top of the aforementioned DLSS 4 Multi-Frame gen, it's also arriving with support for NVIDIA Reflex, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA. NVIDIA claims that players on RTX 50 Series graphics cards can enjoy frame rates multiplied by 7.6X on average with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution enabled while playing the game at 4K.</p>



<p>While 1440p players can enjoy a 5X performance boost if they've got an RTX 5090 in their desktop, making it possible to run the game at "<em>over 400 frames per second</em>." If you don't have a 5090 but you do have an RTX 50 Series card, you can still get the game running at 200+ frames per second, according to NVIDIA, with max settings and ray-tracing enabled.</p>



<p>Dying Light isn't the only game getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, as Mistfall Hunter enters into its closed beta with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support. It's also joined by Farming Simulator 25, which players can update today to see DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support go live.</p>



<p>Lastly, Jump Space, a new PvE co-op action game launching into early access tomorrow on September 19 will arrive with support for NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution, and Gears of War: Reloaded is getting an update today to support DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. </p>



<p>The last big batch of games that got support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 and DLSS Super Resolution included the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">Order of Giants DLC from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">10 years ago, Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe sat down with me at E3 2015 and said he'd like to make a new game in the franchise with a time travel mechanic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was, obviously, a long time ago — so long ago that the Nintendo Switch was still only known by its codename NX — but the chat remains one of Tanabe's most forthcoming interviews on the Metroid Prime series' future, discussing the stories of Dark Samus and Phazon, bounty hunter Sylux, and an idea for a new Metroid Prime game that focused on a single planet across multiple points in its timeline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead of broadening it to more planets I would have one and would focus on the timeline, and being able to change that," Tanabe said to me, at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-proper-metroid-prime-would-likely-now-be-on-nx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> at the time. "That's one interesting idea I have in mind... but I understand many people thought that [Echoes] was too difficult."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By evoking Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Tanabe is referring to its dual-world gameplay that saw players shift between light and dark versions of the same space — a concept that prompted a mix of reactions from players. Still, the idea of time travel appears to have stuck with Tanabe, who has once again returned as the producer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> — a game which contains other similarities to the concept he discussed back then. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take the bounty hunter Sylux, for example, a character that even fans of the Metroid Prime trilogy might struggle to remember. A rival of Samus, Sylux was introduced in the Nintendo DS spin-off game Metroid Prime Hunters (for which Tanabe was also a producer). As part of the same interview a decade ago, Tanabe confirmed the spaceship seen during the cliffhanger tease at the end of Metroid Prime 3 belonged to Sylux, potentially setting up a rivalry in a future game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was Sylux, another hunter from Metroid Prime Hunters at the end of Metroid Prime 3," Tanabe said to me at the time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sonic’s kart racing series should have usurped that red dungaree-wearing handyman years ago. This is a character whose very reason for existing is to go fast, while Nintendo’s portly plumber would only really be rushing to deal with a nasty water leak. However, that’s not the case. While Mario Kart is a literal system seller, the Sonic Racing series tends to drift into second place, a valiant effort, but one which can’t make its speedy hero quite fast enough. Can Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds be different?</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Come Race on Our Level Commercial" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYOfP1a7xjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds feels as though someone saw Ratchet &amp; Clank’s dimension-hopping mechanic and decided to borrow it for a racing game. After the first lap of each race the leader can choose the CrossWorlds track, shifting the action to a completely different zone and introducing a random element into the mix. You might be zipping along through one of Sonic’s casino tracks when suddenly you’re transported to a watery pirate world, or flying through the air above a glorious technicolour meadow.</p>


<p>In theory, it’s an interesting idea, but in practice, it doesn’t give you the same sense of wonder that you might expect, serving instead to take away from the sense of racing on a single track, perfecting the racing line or finding shortcuts, and besting your opponent. It’s just… a bit random, and this is a racing game that already has a lot going on. That’s compounded by many of the tracks just not being all that engaging, and for all that they’re drawing on Sonic’s back catalogue, they might just show that Sonic’s levels aren’t all that interesting…</p>


<p>There’s multiple mechanics at work in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and the Gadget Plate gives you a level of customisation to tailor your kart to your particular preferences. Each Gadget alters your kart’s performance in some way, giving you additional boosts or upgrading specific weaponry to give you an edge against the cavalcade of characters that fill out the game’s roster. They introduce an element of customisation that’s clearly a bit unbalanced, with Gadgets turned off for online modes just days before the game released, but they certainly add something interesting to your offline loadout.</p>
<p>That customisation extends to your vehicle as well. Having definitely looked over the fence into Mario’s garage, you can now select different front and rear parts and alternate tyres for your kart. These also alter your kart’s performance, as well as giving you a dose of visual flair to play around with, letting you customise the colour scheme and add decals too.</p>
<p>It’s an odd mix of decals, filled with gaming partners like ROG and MSI, but then with Air Asia and Beyblade ones too. It’s nice to have the option, but it feels a bit half-baked, with decals unable to be stacked or placed on the side of your car, and if you change any of the parts, it completely resets the decals for that section. The result? You’ll probably give up on decals.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, the shift from Sonic and Sega All-Stars to Sonic Racing means that this is a character roster largely made up of the hedgehog’s pals, rather than from the wider Sega lineup, and it’s a real shame. Sure, we’ve got Hatsune Miku at launch, with Joker and Ichiban coming in a month or two, but the other external characters from Minecraft and SpongeBob – and their associated tracks – are only available as paid DLC, and it’s not out yet.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, beyond Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik this is a bunch of characters that will probably raise little more than a shrug, even for Sonic fans. OK, I’ll give you Big the Cat, but who wants to play as Charmy the Bee?</p>
<p>That contributes to an overall lack of charm. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is certainly bright and colourful, and there’s the odd cheesy Sonic song, backtalking between rivals, and the occasional track that really stands out, but it feels relatively lifeless next to Mario’s last two karting outings. Sonic Racing Transformed was a real celebration of Sonic and the Sega brand, but this just lacks the same soul.</p>

<p>It does at least provide a fairly decent dose of karting. Drifting for speed boosts, performing rapid tricks and flips in the air, and battling it out with rivals can easily have you on the edge of your seat, and as you’d hope, playing with others in multiplayer only makes that stronger. It is chaotic though, and there’s a sense of unfairness that lurks in each corner. The overall lack of identity extends to the weaponry too, and there’s nothing here that’s as iconic as you’ll find in Mario’s series, or even earlier Sonic racing games.</p>
<p>Besides the regular Grand Prix modes, and the selection of speed classes, there’s also the option of Time Trials and the Race Park, a collection of different racing challenges that’s ideally set up for multiplayer, but can be played solo with an AI team if you want. They mostly mess with the formula a bit, so you can race in a team where hitting your teammates gives you both a burst of speed, or a multiplayer battle race where your team have to get the most item hits in. They’re an OK diversion, but they only really serve to emphasise the chaos of the races. I soon headed back to the regular Grand Prix.</p>

<p>There’s elements here that do work really well, from the customisation of the Gadget Plate and your kart to the Jukebox that lets you mix and match your racing soundtrack. Fundamentally though, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds biggest problem is that it doesn’t feel like it rewards you for racing well. Rivals shoot off into the distance, never to be seen again, while rubber banding keeps everyone bunched up behind you. That’s not fun, it’s frustrating, and no amount of dimension hopping and DLC characters can cover that up.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a number of grand mysteries laid out before you in the opening hours of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">which I previewed last month</a>. Who, exactly, are you? Why have you been trapped in torpor for the last century? Who is this voice that’s in your head? And is there any saving Seattle’s vampire community as the Prince is murdered and everyone suddenly struggles for power?</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of these mysteries are quickly unpeeled –&nbsp;Phyre, your player character, is a legendary Elder Vampire known to many as the Nomad, while Fabien, the voice in your head, was until very recently a PI, who’s been indelibly bonded into Phyre’s mind at the time of his death –&nbsp;while others are deepened as the politics, backstabbing and coterie of characters starts to come to the fore.</p>


<p>Our second hands on with Vampire: The Masquerade –&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 picks up right after where we left off with our first, but it’s still a sudden change of pace. You see, instead of playing as Phyre, I suddenly find myself as Fabian, who’s been called in by the club’s owner to meet with Pandora. Pandora, though, has been murdered in a particularly grizzly fashion in the club’s backroom, staked on lengths of rebar and with her head ripped off.</p>
<p>Exploring the scene highlights plenty that’s odd or wrong about this, but there’s something nagging at the back of Fabian’s mind. As he engages his Malkavian abilities to gain more insight, he’s bounced back even further to when he was a baby of a vampire in the 1920s, and an eerily similar murder of a cigarette girl, scouring this site now for clues to take back to his sire and the sheriff of the time.</p>


<p>I love this layered narrative approach, and while the opening hours of Bloodlines 2 are clearly rather guided to get you into the story, I’m really keen to see how the ties between different time periods and the mystery wrapped around Phyre and Fabian continues to unfold.</p>
<p>Brought back to the present as Phyre wakes up –&nbsp;this was just a dream of Fabian’s memories, it turns out –&nbsp;and there’s more pressing matters at hand. The new Prince has one especially troublesome thorn in their side that you might be able to help with, as Sheriff Benny has gone completely rogue and gone on a bloody rampage across Seattle to kill anyone he deems to be too inferior –&nbsp;Thinbloods and Ghouls, in other words. Would you mind helping out, and maybe the Prince will let you stick around in the city?</p>
<p>There’s a clear lead we can take here, trying to trace Benny to his usual hangout, a garage in a corner of town, which is being staked out by the Anarch Ghouls that he’s been waging his single vampire war against. It’s here that we find Benny’s own Sire, a surprisingly young-looking vampire who brought the tempestuous Benny into the fold, way back when. We’re able to use dialogue and persuasion to get him to open up, convince him that Benny needs to be caught and brought back to the Prince to face justice, while learning a bit about Benny’s personality along the way. Can we catch up to Benny and bring him in without a fight?</p>
<div id="attachment_462937"><p id="caption-attachment-462937">Not Anarchs, but these are enemies.</p></div>
<p>The trail takes us to a building site, once again surrounded by Anarchs, and with a clear bloody trail that Benny’s left behind him as he’s been both hunter and hunted, and plenty inconveniences in my way to catch up to him. On this occasion I specced up Phyre as a Tremere, able to use blood sorcery for long-range attacks, and rapid hit and run strikes and it was immediately a lot of fun trying to figure out and plan how I was using my abilities, saving up and spending blood charges earned from draining enemies while taking them out – easier when being sneaky, but vital when in the thick of combat to also restore health.</p>
<p>I leant on three key abilities during this, with Recall letting me place a warp point somewhere safe that I could teleport back to after striking at an enemy, perhaps gliding across or dropping from above before fading away. At the same time, I could cast a Blood Curse on an enemy so that they explode the next time that they take damage, which is hugely useful for taking out tougher enemies, but comes with a time cost to cast at longer distances and when they have higher health. Still, cursing someone from a distance and then hitting them with a brick was eminently satisfying. Finally, Cauldron of Blood could paralyse and fix an enemy in place, screaming from the torment, which is great for temporarily thinning out a group of enemies or letting you close a gap.</p>
<div id="attachment_462938"><p id="caption-attachment-462938">The Blood Curse ability in action.</p></div>
<p>Working through a string of combat encounters, I really enjoyed stringing these together, scrapping through moments that didn’t go quite to plan, and happening across some fun surprises. You know, things like being able to pick up guns – using telekinesis, of course, because who’d want to touch a gun? – and blast away at enemies. It makes a nice change from yeeting bricks.</p>
<p>It built up to a big battle with Benny, having failed to talk him down, and here using a mix of Cauldron of Blood to freeze him in place to I could Blood Curse him was massively effective. Alas, I never quite had the chance to grab guns of any Anarchs that dropped in to interfere with our fight.</p>

<p>With Benny brought low once more, the narrative side of the game could kick in once more. Katsumi, the leader of the Anarchs stepped out of the shadows demanding that Benny be left to face their own justice, and after wriggling my way through that, the Prince saw fit to offer me a job.</p>
<p>It’s at this point that the game will really open up and, while I could have explored Seattle before this point, the narrative will look to take advantage of the open world setting. While it might not play into the specific fantasies that the original Bloodlines did, of creating your own character and navigating this world as a Thinblood, I can’t deny that I’ve enjoyed exploring this character of Phyre, their inherent power and some contrasting abilities and combat styles, and the narrative possibilities that Fabian offers. There’s just around a month to go before the full game’s release on 21st October, but I’m looking forward to venturing into the snow-blanketed nights of Seattle.</p>

			<p>Sonic may not need a car to get around, but a hedgehog has to rest his feet from time to time, and Sega's mascot has amassed a fairly hearty collection of racing games over the years. While most of these racers have struggled to escape the shadow of a certain mustachioed rival's racing efforts, a few have managed to stand on their own and carve out respectable fanbases. Now, only a few months after the big release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the blue guy is also hitting the asphalt again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>



<p>Is this one of Sonic's more successful turns behind the wheel? Or is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds an easy one to cross off your list? Read on to get up to speed...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds mostly sticks to the modern mascot-racer formula, with vehicles that seamlessly transform whether they're on land, water, or in the air, a large collection of different items to frustrate your opponents with, and a focus on earning boosts by drifting around corners and doing tricks.</p>



<p>Past Sonic kart racers differentiated themselves a bit by offering somewhat more realistic driving physics, but that largely goes out the window with CrossWorlds. This game’s vehicles don’t feel like they have much weight or momentum as you take corners, with even Mario Kart's vehicles feeling like they have more inertia. To be clear, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's controls are perfectly responsive; they're just very arcade-y and can take some time to get used to. Thankfully, the game still delivers a proper Sonic-like sense of speed, with even races played on standard middle-of-the-road speed settings feeling pretty peppy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players also have some new freedom to customize their rides and abilities (yes, characters and vehicles are now chosen separately). Prior to races, players can mix and match vehicle parts and a variety of "gadgets" that offer an array of buffs. The latter goes deeper than the former, as there are a fairly limited number of vehicle parts, but around 70 gadgets that can alter your racing experience in sometimes rather novel ways.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's array of items are very derivative of recent Mario Karts -- the red and green boxing gloves are just Red and Green Shells, the Blue Wisp is a Mushroom, the drill-like Yellow Wisp is a Bullet Bill, and so on. But hey, Mario Kart's items are generally pretty fun and well-balanced, so, by extension, this game's items are also pretty fun and well-balanced. While you will get those occasional moments when a sure victory is snatched away mere feet from the finish line, I didn't find CrossWorld’s weapons too overbearing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Much like Mario Kart World before it, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is somewhat fixated on changing the way individual races and Grand Prix cups are constructed. After completing the first lap of a race, whoever is in first chooses between two Travel Ring portals, upon which all racers jump to a CrossWorld track with a totally different theme for the second lap. Sometimes, these CrossWorlds will even have a Frenzy modifier attached, which may make the lap more difficult, or simply more intense, by doing things like flooding the course with warp rings. For the third lap, you return to your original course, although you’ll find it's now been modified with new hazards, shortcuts, and other changes. Each Grand Prix offers three unique courses, with the fourth race consisting of a single lap from the previous three races smashed together.</p>



<p>The CrossWorld gimmick is a neat-enough trick (albeit one that’s pretty much directly lifted from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) and it does introduce some unpredictability to races. That said, while there are 24 regular tracks in the game, there are only 15 CrossWorlds, and in my experience, certain ones came up more often than others to the point they become a bit over-familiar.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of over-familiar, there’s no getting around the fact that Sonic Team was doing some heavy cribbing from Nintendo, particularly Mario Kart 8, when designing this game’s courses. While Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's tracks are perhaps a bit narrower, their loopy, gravity-defying designs are <em>very</em> Mario Kart 8, and many of the themes feel almost directly copy-pasted — here's the treetop track, here's the spooky track, here's the dinosaur track, and so on. It's honestly a bit shameless and makes Sega's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">revive their old "Genesis does what Nintendon't" era marketing tactics</a> for CrossWorlds a bit questionable. More like Sega does what Nintendid a decade ago, amirite?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>‎That said, all snark aside, while they're a bit obvious in their inspiration, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's courses aren't <em>bad</em>. Quite the opposite, really. Mario Kart 8 is a great game, so it's a good source to take notes from. CrossWorld's tracks are intense, sometimes trippy, and fairly visually impressive (a move to Unreal Engine 5 mostly pays off, with only occasional stutters when approaching Travel Rings on PS5). In fact, I’d wager some of the folks disappointed by the more open and breezy approach of Mario Kart World may appreciate these Mario-Kart-8-flavored courses, particularly when combined with CrossWorld’s amped-up sense of speed. Ironically, Sega is offering an alternative to Nintendo by cribbing from Nintendo's own past.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, while Sonic keeps pace with Mario pretty well when it comes to on-road action, CrossWorlds lags behind pretty badly when it comes to content and ways to play. Unlike many earlier Sonic racers, there's no story mode here, with Grand Prix being pretty much your only single-player option. With only 8 cups available at launch, you'll be able to see most of what Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has to offer within 3 or 4 hours. Of course, there are different speed classes, difficulty levels, time trials, mirror tracks, and a roster of rivals to best, but it all comes down to replaying CrossWorld’s somewhat modest collection of tracks and Grand Prix cups over and over. The Race Park multiplayer mode allows teams of players to tackle races with various extra objectives attached (collect the most coins, etc.) but this is just more somewhat transparent remixing of the same limited content.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>More Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds racers, vehicles, and courses are coming, but almost all of it, particularly the crossover content featuring the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants and others, is locked behind a $20 season pass. Of course, racing game season passes are nothing new, but it's hard not to be a bit put off given how quickly the core game races to the finish line.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> finally released this month after years of teasing and development (can you believe a build was playable at E3 2019?). This is a game so anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">it broke the Nintendo eShop the morning it launched</a>, with countless players praising <em>Silksong's</em> gameplay, challenge, and boss battles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But once the credits roll, you might find yourself craving even more Metroidvania exploration, and we have some recommendations to help fill that hole. Here are six Metroidvanias we recommend checking out if you loved <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong!&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><em>Metroid Dread</em></h2>

<p>Though it's silly to call a <em>Metroid</em> or a <em>Castlevania</em> game a Metroidvania when the genre is named after these titles,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-dread" rel="nofollow">Metroid Dread</a></em> is one of the strongest games that the series has seen in recent memory. The best-selling <em>Metroid </em>game of all time, <em>Metroid Dread</em> brings players into the action immediately and does an incredible job of allowing you to explore organically without overly guiding you.</p>

<p>Where other Metroidvanias can feel a little overwhelming, <em>Metroid Dread</em> is manageable and gives you a steady drop of powerups and upgrades to keep the gameplay interesting and the story moving. If you haven't checked out this Nintendo Switch <em>Metroid</em> game yet, especially ahead of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Beyond</em>, we recommend picking it up.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metroid-dread-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Dread</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>An excellent title that came out just last year,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown" rel="nofollow">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a></em>&nbsp;is a refreshing take on the franchise. This sprawling Metroidvania not only boasts colorful and beautiful art direction, but it also gives players crisp controls that make the many platforming sections and boss battles feel very intuitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> also offers some much-appreciated accessibility options, like a Guided Mode that can highlight where your next objective is. If you prefer the classic Metroidvania feel, though, Exploration Mode is the right choice for you. For a super fun, accessible experience that gives you plenty of upgrades and accessories to equip along the way, be sure to check out <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Animal Well</em></h2>

<p>Many of the Metroidvania games we recommend you play after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>fall into the 2.5D HD category, but <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-well" rel="nofollow">Animal Well</a></em>&nbsp;is a deviation that fits securely into the 2D space. Beautiful pixel art and inspiring level design come together to form this experience that quickly became a fan favorite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Animal Well</em> is designed with layers of puzzles and secrets, though how deep the player descends into these secrets is mostly up to the individual. Many of the items collected have multiple uses, and the explored rooms can offer multiple connections to keep you guessing and working through puzzles during the entire experience.<em> Animal Well</em> exists with minimal exposition, giving the player the opportunity to fully explore and enjoy this world on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>The sequel to 2015's <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ori-and-will-of-wisps" rel="nofollow">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a> </em>came along in 2020 and expanded on the original's Metroidvania concepts. Set against artfully designed backdrops with adorably drawn creatures, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps </em>offers an impressively intuitive platforming experience with movement mechanics that are extremely fun to master.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With responsive sword combat and a host of skills and upgrades that make <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> a joy to play, this game provides plenty to love for Metroidvania fans looking for their next experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ori-and-will-of-wisps-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>A true <em>Castlevania</em> spiritual successor (developed by Koji Igarashi, who previously worked on every Metroidvania installment in the franchise), <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night </em>stands out in a crowded segment. If you enjoyed <em>Symphony of the Night</em>, many of the elements carry over to this title, with countless secrets to uncover and a litany of items to collect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players will find a sprawling, meticulously designed castle and engaging combat awaiting them if they choose to check out <em>Ritual of the Night</em>. Fluid gameplay and engaging boss battles come together to make an experience that you won't soon forget. If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has you craving more excellent game design,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>is an excellent choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-review-iga-to-please" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Axiom Verge 2&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Sequel to 2015's <em>Axiom Verge</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/axiom-verge-2" rel="nofollow">Axiom Verge 2</a> </em>builds on its predecessor by offering impressively detailed biomes to explore and a variety of upgrades to pick up along the way. The pixelation of the world doesn't take away from any of its beauty—in fact it adds to it—and the fluid gameplay allows you to effortlessly explore and uncover the secrets awaiting you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many Metroidvania games focus on the strengths of a single character, <em>Axiom Verge 2 </em>offers players both a human form and a drone form that they can transform into, unlocking additional traversing capabilities. If you found&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s&nbsp;combat a little too punishing, you'll be pleased to know that much of the combat in <em>Axiom Verge 2</em> is optional. This experience does an exceptional job of providing you with a detailed and expansive world to explore, making it a great option for those looking for a Metroidvania after <em>Silksong</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What Should I Play After <em>Silksong?&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>These are just six titles that we recommend you check out after playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, but Metroidvania titles are some of the most robust across the gaming landscape, ensuring there's something for everyone. Likewise, if you haven't played <em>Silksong</em> yet and are looking for an appetizer, these titles can be a great way to ease you into the world of Metroidvanias.&nbsp;</p>

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Corsair wasn’t joking around when it named the new $99.99 Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless gaming mouse. At 36 grams, it weighs just a bit more than seven US nickels. Is that <em>too </em>light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s new Inzone mouse</a> is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games.</p><p>Even so, it doesn’t seem like Corsair cut too many corners to reduce the weight. The company claims its tiny 210mAh battery can last up to 70 hours per charge over a 2.4GHz wireless connection with its default 1,000Hz polling rate. The Sabre V2 Pro also supports 8,000Hz polling, letting your PC register a movement or input at 0.125ms, but battery life will dive to just 16 hours per charge in that mode. Peripheral makers love to brag about 8,000Hz polling, but most people’s reaction speeds aren’t anywhere close to sub-millisecond sensitivity, so you can probably save your battery.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro has a symmetrical shape, but is built for right-handed for PC gamers, with two thumb buttons on its left side. Corsair includes grip tape that can be applied to the main buttons and to the sides to customize how it feels to hold.</p><p>Tweaking this mouse’s DPI, macros, and other settings won’t require a software installation. Corsair is launching a browser-based configurator for the Sabre V2 Pro. This is slowly becoming the norm with PC gaming accessories geared toward pros. Allowing access to settings via a browser makes it easy to quickly make adjustments from any internet-connected PC, which makes them more useful during tournament play.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro is available now in black or white.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price]]></content:encoded>
