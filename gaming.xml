            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/canon-mode-ac-assassins-creed-shadows-fans-ubisoft-ps5-1851767902<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-leaked-online-stream-ubisoft-1851766144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-leaked-online-stream-ubisoft-1851766144">After a few delays and leaks</a></span>, Ubisoft’s next main entry in the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span>, is nearly here. And, in a series first, it comes with a mode that removes many choices, instead adhering to one “canonical” narrative path. Now Ubisoft has explained why this option was added and also clarified that you’ll still be free to kiss whoever you want even if you pick the Canon Mode. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196165" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span>, set in feudal Japan and starring two very different protagonists, launches later this month. When fans boot it up, they’ll have an ironic choice to make: During your playthrough, do you want to make choices or not? You can play <em>Shadows </em>like most RPGs, choosing what to say to certain people to affect the outcome of a questline or story arc. Or you can choose Canon Mode, which removes such choices and tells a set story created by Ubisoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396">But why is this previously confirmed Canon Mode</a></span> even in the game? Well, Ubisoft says it’s because of fan “disappointment” over the way all the dialogue options in games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>prevented the creation of a single “canonical” record of how those stories played out.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Gamerant</em></a></span>, creative director Jonathan Dumont talked about the Canon Mode in <em>Shadows</em>. According to him, while many fans have loved the RPG choices in recent <em>AC </em>games, others missed the fact that there was no longer a single, agreed-upon metanarrative. </p><p>  “When we introduced a choice of characters and dialogue choices in <em>AC Odyssey</em>, many of our fans loved the idea, but some expressed their disappointment in not having a definitive and canon narrative for the game that could be embedded in the <em>AC</em> lore meta story, “ said Dumont. </p><p>“After speaking with our fans during development, we decided to add a mode that takes out all the choices for <em>Shadows </em>and that can serve as a reference story within the franchise. This way players can enjoy the more RPG style of narrative or a more linear one, if they prefer.” </p><p>It’s yet another example of how Ubisoft is extremely focused on ensuring that both old school <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fans—who prefer linearity and stealth—and newer fans—who prefer RPG-flavored open-world action—are happy when they play <em>Shadows</em>. </p><p>For those who crave a more traditional <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> experience, you can turn on instant assassinations,  play almost entirely as classic assassin Naoe, and  turn off all dialogue choices, too. On the flip side, you can play the game like <em>Valhalla </em>and mostly fight your way through crowds of enemies with big swords while making hard decisions. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403">As I experienced in my preview with the game earlier this year</a></span>, <em>Shadows </em>truly feels like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> designed from the ground up to make all fans happy. </p><p>However, regardless of whether you play in canon mode or not, Ubisoft will let you romance and kiss any romanceable character you desire. This was confirmed by associate narrative director Brooke Davies while speaking to <em>Gamerant</em>. </p><p> “Because Naoe and Yasuke are different people, they each have unique romance possibilities and connections,” said Davies. “None of our love stories is canon, so players can choose for themselves who—or who not—to pursue.” </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it finally releases on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you may just have to move on to something else. In a  new update posted on Wednesday, it doesn’t appear that Cities: Skylines 2 is anywhere close to releasing on console.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new update</a> ahead of the franchise’s 10th birthday, developer Paradox Interactive said that the team at Colossal Order is making “steady progress” on the console version. They added that a “core focus” has been on performance and stability improvements for the game. That said, there is “more things” that need to be worked on in order to get the game to “the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players.”</p>



<p>“We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release, but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer,” Paradox said. “We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we’re closer to a launch-ready state.”</p>



<p>They closed the console-specific update saying that the goal remains the same, and that’s bringing Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the “best possible shape”.</p>



<p>Originally planned for a release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-release-date-set-for-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a> alongside the PC version, the console edition of the city builder was delayed to 2024 at the last minute. Since then, it has continued to see delays as the developers work around what has been said to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-delay-is-due-to-hardware-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware limitations</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think Cities: Skylines 2 will release on console? Let us know in the comments below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a The Last of Us fan anxiously hoping for word that Naughty Dog is working on a Part 3 video game, I've got some bad news for you. Series creator Neil Druckmann has put a real damper today on any hopes that a Part 3 is in the works...or ever will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Variety</a>, Druckmann gave a lengthy interview today largely centered around The Last of Us TV series. However, at the end, the outlet asked him about the prospect of The Last of Us Part 3. Druckmann responded with quite the shut-down:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was waiting for this question,” he said, sighing. “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the question remains as to if you believe Druckmann or not. Naughty Dog is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">currently hard at work on Intergalactic</a>, which was announced at The Game Awards last December and is likely several years away from completion given its lack of any kind of release window. With the studio's interests firmly in space right now, there's no way the team has time for The Last of Us Part 3 anytime soon. It's entirely possible Druckmann is being coy here, or simply that he isn't willing to commit yet. The passage of time could change this response...or, he could just be done with it. Who can say!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you're craving more of The Last of Us, there's still the television series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-confirmed">with the second season airing on April 13 on Max</a>. And while Druckmann says in the interview he isn't sure how many seasons it will take to wrap up the story of Part 2, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-will-probably-run-for-4-seasons-hbo-exec-says">HBO executive hinted in February</a> that it's looking like four total seasons will be the sweet spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">For a team like Red Barrels, finding success in making just one series for over a decade isn't easy. It seems especially difficult when you consider the series the team makes; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/outlast/" data-ref-id="5000-156501">Outlast</a> is a gruesome, unflinching, taboo-shattering horror series, with gore, violence, and even nudity so beyond most other games that I'm sometimes amazed games in the series don't get Adult ratings.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll also add it's among my favorite horror series, though I didn't anticipate that would remain the case when<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/"> The Outlast Trial </a>was revealed years ago. As a four-player co-op take on the series' typical single-player horror stories, I felt like Outlast might lose some of its best features--the lonesome helplessness and intense situations where no one can save you. Last year, I wrote my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outlast-trials-review-immersion-therapy/1900-6418190/" data-ref-id="1900-6418190">Outlast Trials review</a>, which helped me come to find I had misjudged the game previously. Today, it's become a regular in my rotation, and it's especially interesting to me, given it's essentially a live-service game from a studio new to that highly competitive scene.</p><p dir="ltr">With all of this context in mind, I was eager to speak to Red Barrels game director, Alex Charbonneau, so I could ask him his thoughts on these and other aspects of the game in advance of today's first anniversary since the game launched into its 1.0 state. Charbonneau spoke to the game's jaw-dropping depictions of violence and the problems that can sometimes present for its community. He also touched on how the community has helped shape the game, which originally had far less planned than what we've already seen come to the game just in its first year. Perhaps most intriguing is what he said about PvP coming to the game, which is currently PvE co-op only. Find all these details and more in GameSpot's interview below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453770-news_template_wide_1year_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453770" data-ratio="0.54298642533937" data-width="884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453770-news_template_wide_1year_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453770"></a><figcaption>The Outlast Trials turns a year old today. They grow up so fast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453770-news_template_wide_1year_1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: The Outlast Trials has now been out a year since the 1.0 launch. What is the team's biggest takeaway from that first year, and how has it felt different from the time spent in early access?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The launch of version 1.0 marks the true beginning of our adventure! Throughout Early Access, we learned a lot and saw the game evolve into something dynamic and ever-changing. We had to adapt--because that’s what players wanted. More therapies, more gadgets, more enemies--more of everything. While we never initially planned for the game to function as a live service, we embraced the shift. After all, players love being test subjects! We feel we've reached a great point now. Reagents are Murkoff’s test subjects, and our players are ours. And trust us--there are plenty of surprises incoming!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One thing I'm fascinated by is the world of live-service games and how it can feel like there's a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/" data-ref-id="1100-6511171">volatile, if not vanishing, middle ground</a>. The Outlast Trials seems to be one of a few games that is succeeding in this space without being the biggest game in the world. How does the team view this success, and how does it view this challenge of staying relevant in such a competitive space?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’ve noticed that <em>The Outlast Trials</em> is a game players keep coming back to--sometimes even daily, which took us by surprise! To support this, we created a system where the game evolves regularly: Weekly Programs bring fresh challenges, time-limited events occur every few weeks, and major seasonal updates introduce significant changes. We also believe the game has a unique appeal--new players are constantly discovering its rich content, while seasoned players return to continue their therapy.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's impressed me how The Outlast Trials' live-service elements have worked well even though the team hasn't done something like this before. How did the team approach things like designing daily and weekly tasks, cosmetic rewards, and limited-time events?

Some players assume we’re a massive 300+ person studio, but in reality, we’re a tight-knit group of around 60. Everyone is deeply involved, passionate, and committed to making the game the best it can be. While some of our developers have experience with live service games--shaping certain aspects of our approach--we don’t strictly follow all the usual rules. Instead, we focus on what’s best for our players and scale accordingly. Being a smaller team also gives us a key advantage: the ability to adapt and move fast, which is one of our greatest strengths.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453874-screenshot2025-03-04110155.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453874" data-ratio="0.55877616747182" data-width="1242" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453874-screenshot2025-03-04110155.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453874"></a><figcaption>The Outlast Trials has expanded considerably beyond its original vision already, said Red Barrels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453874-screenshot2025-03-04110155.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are the biggest ways in which the community has helped shape the game over the last year (or even since early access)? Are there major elements you can point to and say they were going to be very different until the community's feedback showed you a new path?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Originally, the game was planned to have just five big Trials--that was it. But after a single weekend in Closed Beta, it became clear that players wanted much more. So, we pivoted, focusing on mechanics that could deliver fresh content without relying on full procedural generation (which we experimented with but found lacking at the time). The result? A massive ecosystem featuring Trials, MK-Challenges, Variators, Escalation Therapy, Daily and Weekly Tasks, Catalogs, and more--all designed to keep players engaged. And when players share their feedback, we listen and act as quickly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How has the community surprised you so far?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’re constantly impressed by the quality of feedback we receive. Our players are deeply invested, and we make sure to read, listen, and watch everything they do. It’s not uncommon for a few insightful comments to send me straight into our editor to tweak something--because what they say just makes perfect sense. Shortly after, the change is live, and players see their impact on the game firsthand. And the truth is--they absolutely do shape the experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A lot of games now do crossovers with things like movies, TV series, and other pop culture. Is there room in The Outlast Trials to do this? Do you plan to do such things?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is something we constantly discuss, but for us, maintaining the credibility and authenticity of the world we’re building is the top priority. If we ever do collaborations, they would need to fit seamlessly into our universe. Right now, we’re already working with incredibly talented artists for voiceovers, and we’re exploring ways to expand these collaborations in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I've enjoyed Outlast games since they first debuted--I even bought a PS4 so I could play the original--but I wasn't sure I wanted a multiplayer game when it was announced years ago. I've learned I was wrong. Has there been a noticeable shift in sentiment toward the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Absolutely. We’ve come to understand that horror is something people love to experience together. At first, this was a huge risk for us. It took countless iterations to get where we are today--because while it may seem simple, it was anything but. Balancing tension and terror in a complex, multiplayer environment was no easy feat. But now, we couldn’t be prouder. <em>The Outlast Trials</em> is an absolute thrill to play with friends, and watching streamers and YouTubers dive into it is just as incredible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453875-screenshot2025-03-04110224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453875" data-ratio="0.55903614457831" data-width="1245" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453875-screenshot2025-03-04110224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453875"></a><figcaption>New abilities have introduced additional character builds into the game, creating a symbiotic relationship between the game's horror moments and its replayable multiplayer aspirations. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453875-screenshot2025-03-04110224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Outlast games are incredibly gory and taboo-defying. This is a feature for many players, but likely a detractor to others as it can be so wildly gruesome. Do you ever have talks about where to draw the line in terms of the game's mature content? Have you had to pull back to avoid an Adult rating?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is a topic we discuss from time to time, but ultimately, we believe the game's uniqueness is what draws players in. Changing that would be a risk, as it could disappoint our fanbase--so for now, it’s not something we plan to do. However, we are exploring ways to help streamers and YouTubers capture content more easily without running into issues.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you (or did you previously) have any plans to introduce a PvP mode to the game or will it always be PvE co-op?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">All I’ll say is that Reagents are test subjects--and Murkoff may have some experiments planned for them in the near future. We do enjoy the competitive aspect of <em>The Outlast Trials</em> in one way or another. So, let’s wait and see what Murkoff is cooking, shall we?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's been shared that the game has sold 3.3M copies so far, making it the biggest Outlast game to date if I'm not mistaken. How does this compare to the team's initial expectations, and what does this figure mean you may do differently in the future?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Achieving commercial and critical success is always incredibly rewarding. Our most valuable critics are the players, and we are thrilled and proud that they love the game. We see this game lasting for many years. We are brimming with ideas for new and exciting content, and the success of the game means we can continue to bring these ideas to life for as long as players join us on this adventure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453876-screenshot2025-03-04110245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453876" data-ratio="0.55922643029815" data-width="1241" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453876-screenshot2025-03-04110245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453876"></a><figcaption>Live events have pushed strategies to regularly shift in pursuit of The Outlast Trials' inspired cosmetic skins.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453876-screenshot2025-03-04110245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The team previously announced Outlast 3. Does the success of The Outlast Trials make that game easier to make, perhaps by funding it and making the IP more popular? Or does it make it harder, perhaps by demanding more resources itself?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Red Barrels is inherently a small company, and we aim to maintain this size as much as possible. When we embark on another project, it will not come at the expense of reducing resources for <em>The Outlast Trials</em>. This is an ongoing discussion within our team to ensure we balance both our existing commitments and new endeavors.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you give any examples of how the game may continue to change shape over Year 2? Maybe there are things you've wanted to do but couldn't until now, or recent changes in philosophy have you trying new things soon.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We've finally reached a point where our pipeline enables us to deliver more of what the players crave. Expect more Trials, more enemies, more prime assets, more gadgets, more cosmetics, more variators, more events--simply, more of everything. For Year 2, players can anticipate a deluge of new content. On the flip side, we also love to keep our players on their toes with surprises. New lore, new twists, new gameplay elements, new modes – Year 2 will, in many ways, be the year of surprises.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The Outlast Trials is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-outlast-trials%2F9nr13rf1v2wv&amp;prompt=none" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001988" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Six supporting cast members have been announced for the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, giving us an idea how the show will expand upon Part 2's story.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-joe-pantoliano-cast-1236327820/">Variety</a>, Joe Pantoliano, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Robert John Burke, and Noah Lamanna will all be joining Bella Ramsey's Ellie and Pedro Pascal's Joel when the second season airs next month.</p>
<p>Pantoliano - whose previous credits include Bad Boys for Life and The Matrix - will play Eugene, while Burke (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit) stars as Jackson resident Seth, and Lamanna (Star Trek: Strange New Worlds) is playing Kat. These three characters have all featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

<p>While it remains unclear how the three new characters will fit into The Last of Us Part 2's narrative, the inclusion of Eugene and Kat gives us an idea as to how the series is expanding upon the game's story.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Kat (or Cat, as she's known in the game) was Ellie's ex, but never actually appeared in person during The Last of Us Part 2 - although she was originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/06/24/storylines-characters-levels-cut-last-us-part-ii/">supposed to feature during the Jackson dance sequence</a>. Instead, she was  only mentioned in passing, with Dina telling Ellie she didn't think Cat was right for her, among other things. This is clearly going to change in the TV series, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-teaser-gives-first-look-at-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby">previous trailer appeared to show Ellie getting her tattoo</a> (which came from Cat in the game). I wonder if we will also see Kat appear in the dance sequence, as well.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Next up, we have Eugene, who again is mentioned in The Last of Us Part 2 but doesn't appear in person, barring collectables. Eugene was a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. He formed a close relationship with Dina (played in the show by Isabel Merced), and more of his story can be uncovered by finding a letter in-game - which reveals he had a wife and daughter, but left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>
<p>"The Fireflies will be fine without you. Your daughter won't," the letter from Eugene's wife Claire reads. "She keeps asking me when you're coming home. I can't lie to her anymore. I miss you. But I don't know how much more of this I can take. Come home. Please. We love you."
</p>
<p>
According to Variety, Eugene's season two appearance will be similar to season one's standalone Bill and Frank episode (and because of which I still can't look at strawberries the same way).
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://wp.me/pc8uak-1lFvkK">about the process of adapting Part 2 for the series</a>, it was revealed the idea to bring Eugene's story into the mix came from showrunner Craig Mazin, but Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann was all for it.</p>
<p>"I get excited when I see these opportunities," he told Variety.  "I'm like, 'Oh, I don’t know Eugene that well!' The story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship."</p>
<p>Given Druckmann's words here, and how Bill and Frank's relationship was expanded upon for season one of The Last of Us, I can only assume Eugene's family relationship and his move to become a Firefly will become a key element of the show's story. Oh, and Eugene is also very tech savvy and had a cannabis lab, so pretty sure that will come up.</p>

<p>It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but Mazin has already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>. It will, however, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>First reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, it's been said that Ballistic Moon, the developer behind the Until Dawn Remake, is now "effectively closed," according to unnamed sources that have knowledge of the ongoing situation. This comes after layoffs that took place in September 2024, where approximately 40 employees were let go. Those who were kept on at the company were only there so that they could provide post-launch support for Until Dawn once it was released in October.</p>
<p>After the release of Until Dawn in October, the company then laid off more staff in December 2024, albeit quietly. During this layoff period, around 20 of the developers lost their jobs. Those who are aware of the situation say that only the studio's founders remain, with the possibility of a handful of employees "at most." The sources have said that there are no employees in public relations, development, or marketing.</p>
<p>Compared to the original Until Dawn, the remake didn't perform quite as well, with a lot of people complaining about the visual changes made to the characters, including the filters and colors that the game had, with them being changed in the remake. However, the game did have a lot of positives, including a new audio score, improved feelings of dread, new endings, and new narrative for players to explore. On Metacritic, the game received a Metascore of 70 and a User Score of 6.5.</p>
<p>Since the game's release, those who have played the game have left comments and feedback for the developers about the bugs they have found in-game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-remake-has-a-broken-ray-tracing-experience-amd-fsr-3-doesnt-work-at-all/">possible patches</a> that need to be made. However, as there are now no developers left, the game can't receive any updates. One source goes on to say, "The studio has effectively closed now."</p>
<p>So far, no one truly knows what is going on with Ballistic Moon, and whether the studio is now in some sort of hiatus, or whether it will go on to close down officially. It's been alleged that the owners of Ballistic Moon have been searching for funding and pitching new projects but without much luck in securing any funding or a publisher for new IP.</p>
<p>"Sony said after the game they might greenlight more funding for updates, but it looks like they didn't," said one source.</p>
<p>When people were asked about the working conditions at the studio, most who responded said that the studio was generally a good place to work in, with positive words spoken about the teams. However, there was an issue of unpaid overtime, with one former employee saying it was equal to "weeks" of unpaid work, where they were then "rewarded" with redundancies across the board.</p>
<p>As of yet, there has been no official comment from Ballistic Moon, and the status of the company is currently undisclosed. Should Ballistic Moon release an official statement, it will be added to this as an update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-custom-dice-review-perfect-dice-set-for-your-favorite-miniature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're in the market for customer player character minis for D&amp;D, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG chances are you've heard of Hero Forge. With an in-depth character editor and recently introduced color options you can build your mini as if it was a video game character and have it 3D printed to your exact specifications. Hero Forge didn't think they had taken the level of personalization far enough and has now moved into dice making, with the added spin that you can include character elements within these resin dice.</p>

<p>This project (which will be coming to Kickstarter soon) lets a player build out their custom character, affix them with a variety of weapons and trinkets, and then take what makes that character so unique, and put it inside dice that you can then roll with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-dice-tower.jpg?itok=HGtqGGDd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-dice-tower.jpg?itok=rgZjizGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here you can see the Frogfolk's head, arm, and top hat encased in dice</figcaption></figure><p>For many dice hoarders out there the concept of a set of dice to match your characters aesthetic isn't new, this has just been taken to a whole new level</p>

<p>In the lead up to this Kickstarter Hero Forge sent over a character they had created (in both Medium and Large size) as well as a set of dice for that character, and an oversized D20 for us to take a look at the end result.</p>

<p>The character is a frog humanoid – perhaps a Ribbet from Daggerheart, or a Grippli in Pathfinder – with all kinds of accessories including but not limited to full armor, a top hat, a sword in it's top hat, a sack, and a frog inside it's sack is a barbarian out of a steampunk fever dream.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice.jpg?itok=EDnNn7QQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice.jpg?itok=gblBUDyR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Being so vivid in his look has made his transferral to dice quite unique though. The dice I received have the following components in them:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The D20 and Oversized D20 contain the characters full head including it's wild mustache and flailing tongue</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D12, a barbarian's favorite dice, shows the great axe with a fun explosion effect on the blade</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D10 features the frog making an angry face with a storm cloud above it's head</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D8 contains the top hat prop</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D6 includes the frog's flexing arm and dumbbells</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D4 contains the small frog from the character's sack</li>
</ul><p>I'm a huge fan of what Hero Forge is doing here, letting you be able to truly create unique dice for your character. Things like damage dice holding the mini of what is doing the damage is also a lot of fun. A Bard could have their lute be inside a D6, ready to give inspiration to a fellow party member. There's no end to fun symbolism to add to your dice.</p>

<h2>The Idea Is Almost There But There Are Some Issues</h2>

<p>While I like the idea of the end result, I will say that at the moment it's not quite polished enough. An issue that a number of the dice I received faces, especially the smaller ones, is that instead of maintaing a clear color they end up with a tint of the object in the dice.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-d4-and-d20-color-comparison.jpg?itok=xXjdz0Aj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-d4-and-d20-color-comparison.jpg?itok=lqeZaXKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Comparing the dice you can see how the hazyness has led to the resin seemingly shifting color</figcaption></figure><p>For my group of dice I can see this most clearly in the frog inhabited D4, which from afar has a far more intense green tint.or the murky brown/green of the D6. Of course the opposite is true for the oversized D20 which looks the clearest.</p>

<p>Talking with Hero Forge about this, as I wanted to verify the green tint on the D4 wasn't an intentional choice, they explained it's an issue with the light refraction. Not only were they able to clearly explain to me what was happening, but let me know they've already been working on a solution and seeing improved results.</p>

<p>When Hero Forge first began to show off their colored prints, I enjoyed the idea but I felt it was still a far cry from having them printed and painting them at home. Seeing their improvements from past colored minis to some I've seen at my D&amp;D table and with the Frog Barbarian is what gives me confidence that Hero Forge will continue to improve upon this.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice_0.jpg?itok=Gb7Aa8Sg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice_0.jpg?itok=yAHSIRzL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What I Didn't Get To See In The Hero Forge Dice Process</h2>

<p>While I got to get up close and personal with this strange frog guy and their perfectly matched dice there were parts of the process that I wasn't able to see. Namely the picking of the objects to go in the dice, picking the size and number of the dice, and picking the lettering.</p>

<p>I was advised that this will be similar to how you can pick and choose kitbashing elements from their current miniature maker, but now you can place those item in your dice.</p>

<p>I was pleased to learn that the lettering can also have their coloring, size, and location changed. One of my largest pet-peeves with dice is not being able to read them as they're rolled onto the table and being able to craft a set of dice for a predominantly green character and being able to make the colors a fiery red to contract will do a lot to help that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-xl-d20.jpg?itok=tWA8-0L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-xl-d20.jpg?itok=rX1ZnM1i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This photo made me realize how much time and effort goes into taking nice photos of objects inside D20s....</figcaption></figure><h2>Hero Forge Custom Dice Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The concept of the idea here is incredible. Take Hero Forge and their incredible ability to print custom high-quality miniatures in full color or the paint at home, and then take the elements you enjoy the most about that character and put them in dice.</p>

<p>It truly makes each character and their corresponding dice feel like part of a complete set in a way that you just can't get unless you're doing it yourself (which will take a lot more time, effort, and money.)</p>

<p>The only reason for now that I would say to hold off would be if you're not just after something unique in your dice, but also clarity around those objects. The refraction definitely takes some shine off such a fantastic and unique product, but if the issue is being attacked similarly to how they've improved their color printing then I'm sure these products will just grow better with time.</p>

In the Variety interview, Druckmann said there will be a number of changes compared to the game, calling it a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-is-a-different-version-of-the-games-story-matrix-actor-joins-cast/1100-6529924/" data-ref-id="1100-6529924">"different version" of the story</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love the changes that we've made," he said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I went to <a href="https://canjamglobal.com/shows/nyc2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CanJam NYC</a>, a headphone convention that took place on the sixth floor of a Marriott in Times Square. Can Jam rocks because it’s full of old dudes and shut-ins with tons of opinions, some exceedingly arbitrary and others backed by painstaking, objective measurement. You’ll see vendors big and small, from up-and-coming dorks who 3D print accessories in their home to big players in the industry. It was in that context that I decided to compare the best the audio world has to offer to two of the most recommended headphones around: the classic Sennheiser HD 650/HD 6XX and a relatively new upstart, the Fiio FT1. It turns out that everyone is correct, and both of these headphones rock.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Can Jam time.</figcaption></figure><p>I should contextualize this by saying that there are, of course, better headphones. And unlike speakers, where the consensus is that they should have a ruler flat frequency response, how people feel about headphones can differ wildly based on personal taste and individual biology. Psychoacoustics is incredibly complicated; there are objectively bad and good headphones, and there is tons of research into what the largest percentage of people will enjoy, but people are also tremendously fickle when it comes to what “sounds good” to them.&nbsp;</p><p>A headphone convention is like a tasters’ platter for obscenely expensive gear; you wander from booth to booth sampling a bit of everything and seeing what agrees with you. Assuming that sharing floor models with a bunch of dorks (complimentary) doesn’t gross you out, it’s a fantastic opportunity to try headphones you may never buy in a million years and see exactly how far your money can go.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Headphones.com testing rig was there if you wanted to measure your headphones. </figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot to be excited about at Can Jam. I got to try closed back headphones from French company Focal, and they were just as clean and defined as people made them out to be. Foxtex was there showing off their new T50RPmk4 RP, the latest revision to a headphone with a lineage so complex that several other companies only exist because they modded them. YouTuber turned IEM tuner Crinacle was there showing off his line of IEMs, including the new “Meta,” and they were indeed beautifully tuned, although not yet for sale. The Headphones.com booth was inviting, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DMS3TV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMS</a> is an aggressively nice person to talk to. I even got to try a bunch of goofy 3D printed meme headphones I had seen making the rounds on reddit, and some cans from Dan Clark that were wonderful but required a very powerful amp and were too rich for my blood. There were wonderful boutique magnetic planars from severe German companies that cost more than a used car.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The BASS Medallion (and other new headphones) at CanJam NYC" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMUHDY0haCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There were countless tiny rooms and booths, so much to explore, and with all that choice I did the most basic thing I could think of: I went to the Sennheiser booth.</p><p><strong>SENNHEISER HD 650/6XX</strong></p><figure></figure><p>In that small space, Sennheiser had a significant presence, with several small tables all laid out in Apple Store fashion. I know what Sennheisers sound like; I have heard many pairs in my life and have always found their house sound to be agreeable. What I wanted to hear is what Sennheisers sounded like next to countless headphones outside of my price range.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I listened to most of their entire range, including their new closed back HD 620S, which sounded perfectly fine to me although not life changing. I finally got to try the infamous HD 800 S, one of the most beautiful and intricate sets of cans I have ever seen at that scale. Unlike a lot of the boutique, niche headphones there, I was able to put them on and say “Yeah, I can hear that these cost $1599.” Though the sound signature is not everyone’s cup of tea, few headphones can match the gargantuan soundstage. While I listened, my girlfriend found a pair of Sennheiser HD 650s. “I like these a lot,” she told me. “Are we getting these?” She had picked one of the most popular headphones of all time.&nbsp;</p><p>If there can be any agreement on what a person’s first “real” pair of headphones should be outside of a pair of inexpensive IEMs or some Koss, it is one of Sennheiser’s Open Back HD 600 series – the Sennheiser HD 600, HD 650, HD 660 S2 and the <a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/sennheiser/hd-490-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new HD 490 Pro</a> (which I count here despite <a href="https://newsroom.sennheiser.com/sonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-pnd0nr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being from the pro division</a>).&nbsp; Sennheiser has sold an untold number of these over the years, starting in 1997 with the HD 600. There are distinct differences between models and everyone has preferences. Many people prefer the HD 600 to the HD 650,&nbsp; but ultimately they are all quite close to each other. The model my girlfriend picked up was the HD 650: It’s neutral to slightly warm, comfortable, oddly durable and thoroughly agreeable.&nbsp;</p><p>Several years back Sennheiser collaborated with direct-to-consumer brand Drop on a variant of the HD 650 called the Sennheiser HD 6XX that is functionally the exact same headphone except it costs roughly $200 instead of $400. This has remained one of the single best deals in the headphone space since its introduction, to the point where dorks get nauseated by the suggestion, but they can go to hell because for most people it’s a fantastic headphone to start and perhaps even end on.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There are, of course, caveats. The biggest Achilles heel of the HD 600 series remains the pads, which sound and feel lovely but get compressed within a year. Headphone pads are tremendously important to how a pair of cans sounds and should be refreshed every once in a while as they degrade and compress. There’s an entire industry of aftermarket headphone pads to improve the comfort and (ideally but not always) sound of a headphone. It is notoriously hard to find a pair of aftermarket pads for these headphones that last for a while without meaningfully making the beloved sound signature worse. I have heard good things about these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkDKpssVm-Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high end ZMF pads</a> and I <a href="https://audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/best-possible-replacement-pads-for-hd650%E2%80%99s-in-2022.38652/post-1362343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered these inexpensive Aliexpress pads</a> on a stranger’s recommendation, but for the most part you can’t go wrong getting legit Sennheiser pads every now and then.&nbsp;</p><p>The HD 600 series are slightly difficult to “drive” if you have never had high-quality headphones before, and they benefit from having a really nice, substantially powerful headphone amplifier. Luckily there’s no shortage of&nbsp; cheap, high quality headphone amplifiers these days. The HD 650/6XX are also open back headphones, meaning they don’t block out much external noise and sound can bleed out of the side. These are not the best pick for streaming or voiceover; they were never meant for that, although I’m pretty sure Northernlion has some Sennheisers and uses them without too much difficulty because he’s a man of refined taste. Most of the really good-sounding headphones, as a general rule, tend to be open back or semi-open because it’s way harder to make a closed back pair of headphones sound nearly as good. The HD 650 doesn’t have a particularly strong bass extension, which is fine for a pair of reference headphones. People sometimes call its sound “veiled,” but that seems to come down to personal preference and can be EQ’d. The imaging is not the greatest, and you don’t get the same sense of space as other headphones, but there are few headphones that sound so thoroughly agreeable and measure so well out of the box.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>In that small booth I went back and forth between the HD 800 S and the HD 650. Without question there was nothing quite like the gargantuan stage of those $1600 headphones. But I asked myself: were they eight times as good as the HD 6XX? I can honestly say no, but few headphones really are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FiiO FT1</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Closed back headphones are tremendously hard to get right. Part of this is the physics of sound in an enclosed space, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_SjaprrZCI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of it is personal biology</a>. For a long time the closed back segment has remained an under-served market particularly in the midrange of around $150 to $200. There are a handful of closed backs that I enjoy with caveats, but mostly those are for studio use like tracking vocals and editing video, not for personal enjoyment. But in the last year or so, a Chinese company named FiiO that has mostly been known for their amplifiers, DACS and portable music players put out a pair of headphones that kind of blew everyone away and disrupted the market thoroughly: the FiiO FT1.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why do closed backs suck? (but I still love them)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_SjaprrZCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>DMS actually has a pretty good video on why closed back headphones suck a lot of the time. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The FiiO FT1 is a shockingly well-made pair of headphones with some minor flaws. It is not to be confused with the FiiO FT1 Pro, which is a totally different open back headphone.The drivers are large: 60mm and made of biocellulose. The cups are made of durable wood in two varieties, Beech and American Walnut. I don’t think either is particularly showy, and I would love to customize or paint the cups, which someone has <a href="https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/fiio-ft1.27467/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already in a beautiful shade of dark blue.</a> These cans are bass monsters, a quality which I mostly do not enjoy in headphones, but they are so well tuned and the bass they put out is so beautifully detailed that I don’t mind. The pads are plush and fit well, a hybrid of leather on the outside and velour inside, and the clamping force is perfect. FiiO use removable cables for this release, which should be mandated by law on all new headphones, and they generously come with both a balanced and unbalanced pair cable. There’s also a fairly well-made rigid carrying case, all for the fairly low price of about $150.</p><figure></figure><p>The FT1 has some imperfections. The early models have a defect with the screw connecting the headband that caused the cans to fall apart. FiiO has owned up to this and has already been addressed in new models, changing the construction, although you should still check yours if you buy one to see which version you got. The other is that the cables, though very solidly made, are slightly microphonic, meaning that if they rub against your chest you can hear it. There is no shortage of high quality microphone cables on Aliexpress and so neither of these are dealbreakers (I have heard good things about Openheart cables and put an order in after getting them). I have read that some people also find the strap uncomfortable (I don’t personally), but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FiiO/comments/1gfcwa9/capra_audio_comfort_headstrap_mod_for_fiio_ft1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s an aftermarket strap mod from Capra Audio to alleviate tension</a> that I plan on getting soon.</p><figure></figure><p>You know something is probably a good deal when you start seeing “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1h5u1dq/fiio_ft1_seem_way_overhyped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is X overhyped?</a>” on the internet, and the FT1 is no exception. The headphone reviewers I keep an eye on, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtoN_lwg3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMS at The Headphone Show</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/cc2pkvfhjYE?si=vov35snDWJ8vNDDJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Z Reviews</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8nama8l9qY?si=s7FaOKBZXP__C6ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gadegry Tech</a>, all <a href="https://unheardlab.com/2024/10/28/review-of-fiio-ft1-rightfully-hyped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sang</a> these phones’ praises. Objectively they measure well, with some pointing out they’re similar but frankly better tuned than the established AKG K361/K371 and definitely better built than those headphones at about the same price. Even the <a href="https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/fiio/ft1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harshest</a> <a href="https://boizoff.com/language/en/fiio-ft1-headphones-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a> could not deny that they are an incredible value for the money, which is saying a lot for any closed back headphone.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have a B&amp;K 5128 measurement rig to test headphones, although I did pester the good people at the headphones.com booth to use theirs on some freak headphones I have a personal soft spot for. I only have the flawed tool of my ears and <a href="http://squig.link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several online measurements</a> to go on, so I went over to the FiiO booth and tried a pair. My expectations were high and surprisingly met. Despite being bassy, I could not deny that they were beautifully tuned and felt better than many of the more expensive closed back headphones I had tried that day. The sound is somewhat V shaped and fun. There is slightly too much sharpness in the presence section, but nothing egregious that can’t be EQ’d, and fairly I have heard far worse when from closed back headphones. “You guys should be proud of this one,” I told the reps at the booth.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>A gift to myself</strong></p><p>Within a few days of leaving the show, I decided to purchase both the HD 6XX and the FT1, as both a birthday gift to myself and to commemorate a decade of not drinking. To be honest I would have gotten a pair of the Sennheisers years ago if I didn't already have a pair of Hifiman HE400i’s from 2018, but those had grown dog-eared over the last six years, and my girlfriend’s face lit up when I mentioned the Sennheisers.&nbsp; The HD 6XX often fluctuates in price between $180 and $220 on Drop.com and I had luckily hit it at the dip. A few days later both headphones arrived. The box of the HD 6XX was appropriately utilitarian, while the FT1 was replete with accessories and eager to please. I put them through their paces – it’s one thing to hear a pair of headphones in a crowded show floor, and another to live with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Living with the Sennheisers was as natural as I had always imagined it would be, and they are now the default for casual work and listening. This was an inevitability I had planned for years. They simply sound “correct,” natural, and relaxed, and require very little futzing. They can withstand abuse and have an iconic look. Meanwhile, I have grown increasingly fond of FT1s as time has gone by – they’re energetic and fun and take an EQ wonderfully. I usually dislike the exact sound signature that the FT1s are targeting, but there’s just something so satisfying and well-executed about their sound, particularly after taming some of the harsher frequencies. These are also fairly sensitive headphones, so you technically can use them with your phone and a cheap dongle without too much worry. I would probably not use them for studio work, but perhaps that’s an arbitrary distinction. Both the Sennheiser HD 6XX and the FiiO FT1 were worth every single dollar, and neither was a replacement for the other. I felt satisfied.</p><p><strong>Mid-fi and diminishing returns</strong></p><figure></figure><p>To the extent that I have a goal when I write about gear, it is never to write about the most expensive or glamorous tool in its category. Rich people are boring, and spending a lot of money on something because it is nice is almost never interesting unless there is a degree of DIY or craft to the endeavor. I always try to ask myself, “What is the best choice for the average Aftermath reader? What is an affordable object they will treasure for a long time?” Both the proven Sennheiser HD 6XX and the disruptive FiiO FT1 are that rare object. The former is classic and timeless, part of a lineage that spans decades. The latter is booming and changes the market. It has demolished everything in its specific price and category, and an entry that firmly establishes FiiO as a force to be reckoned with in the closed back headphone space.</p><p>In a hall full of beautiful headphones, including those HD 800s with their gargantuan soundstage, I came to accept the value of something being just good enough to become eternal. Headphones are a hobby you can spend an obscene amount of money on in the pursuit of perfection, but sometimes it’s nice to stop while you’re ahead. Sometimes hype and the boring wisdom of crowds is real. The sky is blue, water is wet, and the Sennheiser HD 6XX and FiiO FT1 are damn near impossible to beat for the money.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo"><h3>Deliver At All Costs Is *CRASH* A Great *SMASH* Demo *HOUSE FALLS DOWN*</h3></a><p>Yeah yeah I'll finish the first mission, right after I *DRIVES THROUGH GAS STATION*</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible"><h3>Gundam GQuuuuuuX Is The Sum Of Its Parts In The Best Way Possible</h3></a><p>The new Mobile Suit Gundam is FLCL, Pokémon, and a hint of Evangelion</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>There's a whole lot of The Last of Us coming your way next month. To begin with, PC players will finally be able to get their hands on the 2020 sequel thanks to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a>, which will be released on the platform on April 4 via Steam and the Epic Games Store. The port is being handled by Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy.</p>
<p>Then there's the second season of the acclaimed HBO TV series featuring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. This new season will include a portion of the story seen in Part II and start airing on April 13, giving you just enough time to experience the game's version of the story, which is said to be quite different.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Variety</a>, series creator Neil Druckmann explained:</p>
<p><em>I love the changes that we’ve made. It's a different version of that story, but its DNA is in there. Maybe more than excited, I’m really curious what their reaction will be.</em></p>
<p>Some of the changes include changing Abby's character to accommodate the difference between her character in the game, who's very powerful physically, and actress Kaitlyn Dever, who's far slimmer. On this subject, Druckmann said:</p>
<p><em>Kaitlyn Dever wanted to work with us; we wanted to work with her. It's not worth passing it up to continue a search that might never bear fruit to find someone that matches the physicality.</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, many fans had hoped to see Dever cast as Ellie before the creatives settled on Bella Ramsey. On the other hand, there was the matter of age, since Ramsey was much closer to the character than Dever. This might be why they settled on her instead but still wanted to work with an excellent actress like Dever, though that's speculation on our part.</p>
<p>There will be some additions to the plot of The Last of Us Part II. For example, the character Eugene is only named in the game, but he'll be seen (played by actor Joe Pantoliano) in this new season of the TV show. Druckmann commented:</p>
<p><em>I get excited when I see these opportunities. I'm like, ‘Oh, I don’t know Eugene that well!’ The story we told in the game was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.</em></p>
<p>According to showrunner Craig Mazin, there may be space for one or two more seasons. But what about The Last of Us Part III? Well, Druckmann didn't give much hope to fans:</p>
<p><em>I was waiting for this question. I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.</em></p>
<p>Looking at the history of Naughty Dog, it's entirely possible he's not lying. The Californian studio is known for abandoning its successful IPs over time, starting with Crash, then Jak and Daxter, and then Uncharted. At the latest The Game Awards, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its new sci-fi franchise, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. If that game sells well enough, they might work on a sequel for it instead of going back to The Last of Us. We've prepared a little poll to gauge your opinion on what they should do. Let us know your take in the comments!</p>

Its innovation was trading a set party of heroes for a cast of 108 total characters who could be recruited on your adventure. Combined with a world of rune-based magic and political intrigue, <em>Suikoden I </em>and <em>II</em> managed to carve out a unique lane in a crowded field, and now both games have finally been updated with modern bells and whistles for current platforms. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve played around a bit with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968/slides/24&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968/slides/24"><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> collection</a></span>, which technically includes the much longer subtitle “Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars,” and am pleased to report two main takeaways. First, these JRPGs still have the juice, especially <em>Suikoden II</em>. The snappy turn-based combat and open-ended collect-em-all-fest holds up 30 years later, with decent storytelling and even better character writing. </p><p>Second, both games have survived the journey from low-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 HD <em>mostly</em> intact and looking better than ever, especially in <em>Suikoden II</em>. The character sprites remain perfectly pixelated-looking without any smoothed-over upscaling effects or muddy silhouettes. The backgrounds, never a series highlight, look crisp and get the job done. The tiling of its top-down world can feel a bit bland and repetitive, but certain scenes with more detailed shadows and lighting really pop. Most importantly, the battles still look and feel great, at least to the eyes of someone who grew up with these games back in the ‘90s. Things are less great in <em>Suikoden I</em> where some environments look weirdly flat and empty. </p><figure id="" data-id="d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-recommend-id="image://d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters fight a bug in battle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those unfamiliar, <em>Suikoden I</em> (1995) follows military nepo-baby Tir who comes into possession of a magical relic that jumpstarts a rebellion against the empire he had previously pledged to serve. <em>Suikoden II</em> (1998) follows childhood friends Riou, Jowy, and Nanami after a false-flag attack by their military unit leads them to be branded as traitors amid an invasion by a neighboring kingdom. The first game is about 20 hours long and focuses mainly on recruiting characters to aid you in your fight against the evil Scarlet Moon Empire, while the second is longer, much more narratively dense, and a bit more morally grey and complex. </p><p>Both are propelled along by random encounters and boss fights, toil made much better than in some other games thanks to <em>Suikoden</em>’s old-school but flashy turn-based formula and the fact that you’re always finding new characters with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to fight alongside. Instead of just three or four characters, you get to fight with six, with front and back rows as well as synergistic combo attacks adding to the strategy. None of it felt  revolutionary at the time like the multi-cam cinematic quality of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> battles, but it’s crunchy and well-balanced as far as conventional turn-based combat goes.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-recommend-id="image://ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs across a town.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So what improvements and new quality-of-life features does the <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> collection bring to the party? Aside from the graphical overhaul and updated script (the original localized versions were far from perfect), there are standard additions like auto-saves (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">though only on a screen with a save point?</a></span>) and a menu log that keeps a record of what people have told you. There’s no mini-map but you can sprint from the start now. You can speed up fights to auto-battle through them quickly, though weirdly the music speeds up during this as well. Plus there are optional difficulty modes now. The ability to turn off timed events is coming in a day-one update (certain characters can’t be recruited if the in-game clock ticks past a certain point). </p><p>It’s unfortunate that you can’t speed up the game outside of battle, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have the option to turn on the game’s old graphics and aspect ratio for enthusiasts who want to revisit the original experience on PS1. The inventory systems in both games are also still a pain (though not nearly as clunky as how they were left in the recent <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>). An in-game gallery, museum, or other historical feature would have been a nice bonus as well, especially for the $50 price tag. The bar keeps rising for modern remasters of all-time classics, and it certainly feels like there was room for <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster </em>to be a more comprehensive package. </p><p>It doesn’t make any major missteps, though, which can’t be said for every PS1 JRPG that gets an HD makeover. <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> presents one good game and one excellent one (it’s sacrilege to say but if you’re short on time I think you should just play<em> II</em>) with everything a modern player needs to enjoy two genre classics (well, except for maybe an option to turn off random encounters). Konami has already announced an anime adaptation of <em>Suikoden II </em>and a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567">mobile spin-off called<em> Star Leap </em>that looks beautiful but has gacha microtransactions</a></span>. If this burgeoning <em>Suikoden</em> renaissance is successful, though, maybe we’ll finally get<em> Suikoden VI</em>, or at least <em>Suikoden III</em> as a PS2 classic on PlayStation 5.  </p><p><strong><em>Update 3/5/2025 2:29 p.m. ET: </em></strong><em>Added a link to Aidan Moher’s review </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>which discovered the auto-save feature is basically a lie</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ballistic Moon, the studio behind the PC and PS5 remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/until-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-616356">Until Dawn</a> released last year, is now "effectively closed" after failing to find a publisher for its next game.</p><p>A new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> reveals that only the studio founders and a handful of others potentially remain employed there at this point. The studio reportedly couldn't find funding for its next game, and Sony didn't give the studio any support for future work on the Until Dawn franchise. Ballistic Moon has yet to comment on this situation.</p><p>Ballistic Moon is a U.K. developer founded in 2020 by industry veterans from studios like EA and Supermassive Games. So far, Ballistic Moon's only game is 2024's remake of Until Dawn, which brought the beloved PS4 choose-your-own-adventure horror adventure game to Unreal Engine 5. It featured a recomposed musical score, changed the gameplay camera to a third-person perspective rather than a fixed-camera one, and added a post-credit scene teasing a sequel. It received a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/until-dawn/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lukewarm reception</a> compared to the original.</p><p>It's unclear if there is a Until Dawn sequel in active development right now, but if one is, it seems that Ballistic Moon is not the studio working on it. Whatever Ballistic Moon's next project was, Insider Gaming explains that the studio couldn't find funding or an interested publisher for it. Ballistic Moon had actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-lays-off-several-staff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">laid off some developers</a> prior to the Until Dawn remake's release last October, although this report explains that many of the 20 or so remaining developers were cut in December.</p><p>If you want to play Ballistic Moon's take on Until Dawn, it's available on PC and PS5. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-until-dawn-trailer-serves-up-fresh-nightmares/1100-6529477/" data-ref-id="1100-6529477">movie based on Until Dawn</a> also hits theaters next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/not-another-last-of-us-game-druckmann-ambiguous-suggest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview with Variety, Neil Druckmann suggested that The Last of Us might be over and done with. He said, ‘Don’t bet on there being more Last of Us.’ It’s a rather ambiguous statement, as it’s not immediately clear if he’s saying there are no more Last of Us games coming <strong>now</strong> or if The Last of Us Part III will be the final game in the series.</p>



<p>In April, the second season of the award-winning HBO series will drop, more than two years after the first season arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-could-be-it">‘This Could Be It’</h2>



<p>The Last of Us was released in 2013 and has since been remastered and re-released no fewer than 743 times across multiple platforms and generations. In 2020, the follow-up title – aptly named The Last of Us Part II – was released. It was a controversial title in many ways, but it was still a masterpiece of a game that turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>On April 3, Part II’s newest iteration, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, will be released on PC.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent segment with Variety</a>, Neil Druckmann talked about the second season of the Emmy Award-winning show. He sat down with Craig Mazin, with whom he has pioneered the creation of one of the best live-action adaptations in gaming history.</p>



<p>In one section, Druckmann answers the question about the existence of The Last of Us Part III, which has been rumoured on and off but never confirmed. When asked about the possibility of the game surfacing, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was waiting for this question.</p>



<p>I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us’. This could be it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s ever so slightly ambiguous. It could mean that there’s nothing more planned after a third game, or it could mean that we’re stuck with a two-game series that’ll never again see the light of day.</p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">an online multiplayer game</a> set in The Last of Us’ universe was cancelled, but in 2024, the studio ‘teased’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-teases-new-chapter-for-the-last-of-us/">a new chapter</a> in the franchise. That was before Naughty Dog appeared at The Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/">to reveal Intergalactic</a>, an all-new IP that came completely out of left field.</p>



<p>Do you think The Last of Us should end on Part II? It’s no big secret that the team plans to drag out the television series and cover the second game across <strong>two </strong>seasons, so we’ve got Last of Us content in the pipeline for a while, but would you rather play it than watch it?</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments.</p>

			<p>It's been a while since we heard any news about Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra. The action/adventure game in development at Skydance New Media and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to be published by Plaion</a> should launch this year, but there have been no further details on the release timing, and some fans have been worried about a delay.</p>
<p>According to Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton, though, the team is still doing its best to release it this Holiday season. <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to The Direct</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited. To be playing him in the video game, playing his grandfather, be playing a version of Black Panther, and looking on there and seeing that it's me… It's like the most photo realistic… We want people to play this game and have the entire family, sit on the sofa and watch it like they're watching 'Game of Thrones,' or 'The Walking Dead,' or something. We’re looking for just an incredible cinematic experience for everybody, and I pinch myself.</em></p>
<p>Payton is definitely right about the game's photorealism. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> the impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals during Epic's Unreal Engine GDC 2024 live stream.</p>
<p>The development team is helmed by none other than Amy Hennig, who's renowned in the industry for her work on Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver, Uncharted, and Battlefield: Hardline. She was famously developing the Star Wars game codenamed Project Ragtag at Visceral Games before the studio was shut down and the project canceled.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in September 2022, Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra is set in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II. It involves Steve Rogers (Captain America) forming an uneasy alliance with Azzuri (Black Panther), the king of Wakanda. Other playable characters include Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Nanali, leader of the Wakandan Spy Network.</p>
