			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> had more than a few big announcements, and it also saw the return of one of the industry's most notable indie developers, with Braid and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-witness-review-life-puzzle/">The Witness developer</a> Jonathan Blow and his team at Thekla, Inc., announcing their next project, Order of the Sinking Star. </p>



<p>It's a narrative puzzle game set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 that Blow calls "<em>the biggest game I've worked on</em>," and a quick look at the trailer will make you understand why he describes it that way. It's a puzzle game on a scale you don't normally see, as you mash together different worlds and solve over a thousand puzzles crafted by Thekla Inc.</p>



<p>"<em>Order of the Sinking Star is the biggest game I've worked on, and also the most collaborative</em>," Blow said in a press release. "<em>It's a kind of game design supercollider that brings together ideas from many designers to create a puzzle landscape that's much more intricate and vast than what has come before." </em></p>



<p>"<em>We've successfully pushed the limits of what is possible in a puzzle adventure. The game is just incredibly complex and deep, and I can't wait to show more as we move toward launch in 2026.</em> <em>The game showcases design contributions from Alan Hazelden (A Monster's Expedition), Sean Barrett (Promesst), Jonah Ostroff (Heroes of Sokoban), Zach Polansky (Enigmash), Patrick Traynor (Patrick's Parabox), Marc ten Bosch (Miegakure), and several others</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Announcing Order of the Sinking Star is a major moment for us, for Jonathan and his team,</em>" added Yoon Im, chief executive officer of Arc Games, the publisher behind Order of the Sinking Star, in a press release. "<em>It represents an exciting year ahead for all of us. It's an honour to support Jonathan to make his most ambitious project yet a reality, as we believe Order of the Sinking Star is set to be the premier and innovative puzzle adventure of this generation. This announcement today marks just the beginning of what we have planned for a game-changing year for us next year.</em>" </p>



<p>While Order of the Sinking Star is currently only set to arrive on PC, it will likely come to other platforms as the press release mentions that "<em>additional platforms and release timing for the game will be revealed at a later date</em>." So expect Order of the Sinking Star to be available on other platforms beyond PC, it just might not arrive on consoles at the same time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bradley-the-badger-the-game-awards-trailer-2000653003</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The action-platformer is a 'part love letter...part satire' of contemporary video games
                </p><div>
              
              <p>While the main show of The Game Awards featured some big reveals and cinematic extravaganzas, it was during the pre-show that the real star appeared. An action-platform game called <em>Bradley the Badger</em>, that looks to be four-dimensional folding layers of meta about gaming, with multiple jovial jabs taken at names like&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>

 <p>Beginning with the conceit that we’re already big, nostalgic fans of Bradley, a cheerfully-colored mascot platforming character who’d be right at home in the PS2 era, <em>Bradley the Badger</em>‘s trailer sees the titular character enthusiastically setting out on his latest adventure, to discover his house is now inside some sort of grimdark Soulslike. Walls are made of petrified hands, some holding blue-glowing lanterns, and then a title card drops in reading “Badgerborne.” But as Bradley to platform around in this unpleasant reality, he discovers that it’s very much not finished. Art assets are marked as “WAITING FOR REVIEW,” while sticky notes appear all over demanding fixes.</p>

 <p>This, Bradley discovers, means he can start manipulating these unfinished textures and placeholder blocks, such that he can drag and reshape his own platforms, or reprogram the properties of items. And there, there you’ve got a <em>brilliant</em> idea for a game.</p>

 <p>Except it keeps adding. Once Bradley’s in a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> reality, he’s able to transform himself into untextured items in the world, becoming a trash bin that can roll up walls, or in a&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em> spoof turn into both a pick-up truck and a size-changing apple. This all starts to look really incredible, the game not demanding players learn code (thank god), but rather just having toggles for various settings of each item, explosive or inert, big or small, magnetic or not. And just as you’re getting to grips with what this is all about, Bradley reaches the end of what’s been coded in the game. And wakes up. As a real person, FMV, with filthy human feet and hands, and a dirty, ill-fitting badger hat on his head. He’s in the development studios of Dreamwoods Games, the walls covered in Bradley posters and notes, and at that point I have no idea what this is.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">game’s Steam page</a> makes things a bit clearer. This is, at heart, an action-platformer, but one where you have “game developer powers.” But on top of that, it’s a game about a beloved franchise becoming self-aware, realizing his fictional reality, and fighting against it to try to restore his normality. And then, yes, the story will include live-actions sections too. Which is glorious.</p>

 <p>Evan Peters, the&nbsp;<em>X-Men</em> movies’ Peter Maximoff, plays the real-world version and voice of Bradley, in the first game from Day 4 Night Studios, the first game from team of former AAA devs who have variously worked on games like <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Alliance</em>. One of the co-creators, Christian Cantamessa, calls&nbsp;<em>Bradley the Badger&nbsp;</em>“part love letter to video games and part satire of them.”</p> <p>The game is set for a Steam release in 2026, but will clearly be looking for console releases after its TGA appearance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Offloads Its 15.6″ Laptop at 72% Off, Margin Clearly Not the Goal on This Windows 11 Pro PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-offloads-its-15-6-laptop-at-72-off-margin-clearly-not-the-goal-on-this-windows-11-pro-pc-2000652643</link>
            <guid>1381747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but not all of them are worth your money. If you’ve been after a solid option for remote work or studies, the 15.6-inch HP Flagship touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, and right now, you can treat yourself to it without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">It’s typically priced at $1,900, but Amazon just took a whopping 72% off it, dropping the machine down to just $540.</a> You’re saving over $1,300 on an option that has enough muscle to handle all your everyday tasks. The retailer is also offering a bunch of freebies with your purchase for absolutely nothing, which adds even more value to the purchase. Grab it before the deal expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Useful Features</h2>
<p>This is a decent mid-range laptop that runs on an Intel i3-1315U processor, capable of clocking up to 4.5GHz with Intel Turbo Boost technology. It’s ideal for browsing, streaming your favorite shows, and regular office work, but might struggle to push through heavy gaming or demanding creative tasks. If you’re planning to use it for basic computing, it’s going to be a solid choice. Those looking to game and push creative limits should consider an i5 or i7.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16 GB RAM to keep things running smoothly, which even lets you multitask on busy days with ease. Again, it’s not massive, but you’ll be able to use a couple of different programs and hop through a range of tabs without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. The 512GB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important media files and work documents, whether you’re looking to store high-resolution photos, videos, research files, or office projects. Additionally, since SSDs are much faster than traditional hard drives, you’ll also experience quicker boot and transfer times when launching the system or moving files around.</p>



<p>The display is a stunning 15.6-inch BrightView touch screen that is virtually borderless for a wide viewing experience. It pushes detailed, brilliant visuals for all that’s playing on the screen, from work presentations to movies and TV shows. Touch support means you won’t have to rely on just the trackpad or the mouse to get things done. Just use your fingers on the screen directly to scroll through pages, swipe images, zoom in on text, and even sign documents. It also comes in handy when two people are using the laptop; your friend won’t have to awkwardly reach for the trackpad/mouse to do something.</p>
<p>Ports include an AC smart pin, USB Type-A, USB Type-C, HDMI, and more. Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you’ll have instant access to a bunch of security and productivity features that Microsoft has designed keeping remote workers and professionals in mind. Copilot support lets you use AI to get help with tasks throughout the day. You can use it to find answers to random questions without opening a browser, get help with crafting replies, summarize documents, and even brainstorm ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">Other freebies include a DVD/CD drive, a Redragon mouse, a screen wipe, and a 256GB SD card.</a> This 5-in-1 bundle (including the pre-installed OS) is worth almost $200, but you’re getting it here at no extra cost. We highly recommend grabbing the discount while it’s still live – which might not be for long. You can treat yourself to the laptop, or pick it up as a gift for a loved one this holiday season!</p>

<p>With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 up for a record number of nominations at The Game Awards 2025, there was every chance it would bring home many of those accolades. Sure enough, the RPG cleaned up at The Game Awards 2025.</p>



<p>It was a huge night for Sandfall Interactive and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The surprise news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-major-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 DLC dropped through a free update</a> was fun, and it rounded off a successful night for the mega-popular role-playing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-2025-record-broken-by-clair-obscur-expedition-33">The Game Awards 2025 Record Broken By Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A worthy winner. Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>With many of the Sandfall Interactive crew in attendance at The Game Awards 2025 dressed up in striking French-inspired gear, there was an air of expectation that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would do something very special.</p>







<p>Nearly four hours later, the 2025 GOTY took home <strong>nine of the 13 awards it was nominated for</strong>. This smashes the previous record of most awards accumulated in one night, set by <strong>The Last of Us Part 2’s seven awards</strong> at the 2020 show.</p>



<p>In other years, Forza Horizon 5 and It Takes Two claimed three awards each in 2021, God of War Ragnarok took home six in 2022, Baldur’s Gate 3 matched GOW’s feat in 2023, and Astro Bot was the recipient of four last year.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year</li>



<li>Best Game Direction</li>



<li>Best Narrative</li>



<li>Best Art Direction</li>



<li>Best Score and Music</li>



<li>Best Performance</li>



<li>Best Independent Game</li>



<li>Best Debut Indie Game</li>



<li>Best Role Playing Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Sandfall’s debut RPG release was worth the hype? Does it deserve the nine awards it claimed? Have any games been cruelly robbed of an award, such as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for Best RPG?

The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">backtracked on those plans</a>, however, opting to sell the game for $70 and cancelling plans for other $80 games in the future. What happened here? And what does Microsoft think about pricing for its games going forward?</p><p>Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the decision to roll back prices from $80 to $70 came about from listening to player feedback and trying to deliver "player value."</p><p>"We've reacted in the last year and I think for us, the real focus is going to be ... meeting people where they are. I think there's going to be less of a focus on what's that top line price of a game, as people start to engage in different ways with games," he said.</p><p>Thinking about a set price like $50, $60, $70, $80, or more is missing the point, Booty said. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for pricing, and Booty said the company will continue to monitor feedback as it looks to set prices for games in the future.</p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>While Microsoft didn't end up releasing any $80 games this year, the company did hike prices for Xbox fans in other ways. Microsoft jacked up Xbox console prices and increased the monthly cost of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by a whopping 50%.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, and the company says the game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">so much value that it justifies the higher cost</a>. The game is also available in a $500 hardware bundle, however.</p><p>Looking further out, many are wondering what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> will cost when it releases in November 2026. Some people think it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">warrants a $100 price tag</a>, while others have said the game does not need to be $100 because its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has responded once again in the continuing war of words with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> developer Rockstar, this time describing the studio's latest statement, on its controversial firing of 34 employees, as an attempt to "reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals."</p>
<p>The IWGB's statement comes after several back-and-forth claims between the two parties. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstar-is-still-insisting-its-controversial-firing-of-employees-had-nothing-to-do-with-unions">Rockstar's own, most recent response</a>, issued yesterday, saw the studio claim the employees in question had "distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations," and that "claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p>
<p>That in turn came<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests"> after a report from People Make Games in late November</a>, which claimed the workers were fired for conversations which took place on an invite-only Discord server for employees and IWGB union members. Most conversations held there were focused on salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues, the report said - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>The employees were initially fired for what Rockstar called "gross misconduct", before it was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">accused of union busting</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">subjected to a lawsuit from the IWGB</a>.</p>
<p>The IWGB's latest full response reads:</p>
<blockquote>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation - they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals. Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as "leaking information". It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest - all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</blockquote>
<p>The likely trigger for this statement from Rockstar - which had previously refused to comment on the People Make Games report - and the ensuing IWGB response is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioning the situation in parliament</a> earlier this week. There, he called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning" and promised MPs would look into it.</p><p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said. It was the second time the issue had come up in UK parliament, after it was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West, back in November.</p>
<p>Notably, the UK's Labour government had made workers rights a key part of its election manifesto, and is currently aiming to push its flagship employment rights bill through the House of Lords. That context places an additional spotlight on Rockstar, while in the last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-workers-europe-fight-back-against-exploitation-ai-layoffs-historic-milestone-union-efforts">protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Tetris-playing watch struggles with the one thing it should be great at]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/842702/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1381708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.myplaywatch.com/tetris"><em>Tetris</em>: My Play Watch</a> may look like an Apple Watch, but it eschews most of the functionality you’ll typically find on a smartwatch to focus on two things: playing <em>Tetris</em> and celebrating the game through a UI that’s thoroughly <em>Tetris</em>-themed. It’s very good at making you <em>want</em> to play Alexey Pajitnov’s iconic tetromino-stacking puzzler, just not on the watch because of frustrating touchscreen controls that require more focus than the game itself.</p><p>The included straps are colorfully <em>Tetris</em>-themed (you can swap them with standard watch straps if you want to tone it down), as is the collection of nine different faces. There are both digital and analog options with different themes and colors that display a mix of various metrics, including battery life and fitness stats. They all manage to work tetromino pieces and the <em>Tetris</em> logo into their designs, but there’s no customizability.</p><p>The watch’s interface is navigated using its touchscreen and a side crown dial that’s pressed or rotated to make selections or to scroll lists. There aren’t any other buttons, but you wouldn’t need them since the watch’s functionality is so limited.</p><p>From the main menu, you can play <em>Tetris</em> or use other features that include a stopwatch, timer, calendar, calculator, fitness tracker, and alarm. They’re all very basic. You can set multiple alarms, for example, but you can’t customize when they repeat or choose anything other than the main <em>Tetris</em> theme with gentle vibrations to alert you. Even the Game Boy version of <em>Tetris</em> that launched 36 years ago had alternate themes to choose from.</p><p>There’s a heart rate sensor that matched readings from my Apple Watch Series 9, but the other fitness tracking metrics are limited. There’s step counting with an adjustable daily goal and stride length options to improve accuracy, and an estimation of the calories you’ve burned that resets every night. There’s no history, no proactive health warnings, and no notifications at all because the watch lacks Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and doesn’t connect to your smartphone.</p><p>It’s an upgrade over a traditional digital watch and could be an option for someone who wants the look of a smartwatch without notifications. But anyone considering <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM9TYLT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">spending $79.99 on it</a> is buying it to play <em>Tetris</em>. Unfortunately, it’s not a great implementation.</p><p>Previous versions of the My Play Watch used the crown dial to play retro games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254312/space-invaders-my-play-watch-taito-kickstarter"><em>Space Invaders</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632077/atari-2600-my-play-watch-pong-centipede-missile-command-super-breakout"><em>Breakout</em></a>, but the<em> Tetris</em> version is played only via the touchscreen. When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785725/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch">watch was announced in September, I was worried</a> that touch controls “could prove challenging on a small screen for those chasing high scores,” but it turns out the controls make even just quick play sessions frustrating.</p><p>You move pieces by dragging your finger across the screen from side to side, rotate them by tapping, increase their fall rate by tapping and holding, or immediately drop them onto the stack below with a downward swipe. The gestures are easy enough to learn, but I found the watch’s touchscreen would either regularly not detect them or misinterpret what I was doing. Short finger slides meant to reposition a piece by a few cells were frequently detected as a tap, resulting in an unwanted rotation. On more than one occasion, when I quickly tapped in a panic to rotate it back, the watch would interpret the gesture as a downward swipe and drop the piece where I didn’t want it.</p><p>There are options in the game’s settings that try to make the touch controls easier to use, including auto-rotate, which predicts the best orientation for a piece based on what’s below it. But accidental spins still happen and often mess up your game. Playing <em>Tetris</em> on the watch isn’t impossible, but because of the frustrating touch controls, I found myself focusing more on carefully executing taps and swipe gestures than any kind of stacking strategy. It increased the challenge, but not in the way any <em>Tetris</em> fan would want.</p><p>Equally disappointing is that the control issues I experienced can’t be remedied through software updates, since the watch isn’t capable of getting any. Even something simple, like limiting rotations to taps on the edges of the screen, would help, but it’s a change that can only be implemented in future versions of the watch.</p><p>Battery life isn’t great, either. I’m already used to charging my Apple Watch every night, but you need to limit your playtime to get a full day’s use from the <em>Tetris</em> watch. During my first day of testing, I maxed out the brightness and volume, and with less than 15 minutes of playing <em>Tetris</em>, the watch’s battery drained in 6.5 hours. Reducing the brightness to its lowest setting and halving the volume doubled its battery life to about 12 hours. The battery lost about 6 percent of its charge while playing <em>Tetris</em> for five minutes.</p><p>I like the idea of a wearable version of <em>Tetris</em> that I can quickly play without distracting notifications. It’s a game that relaxes my brain and is a nice stress reliever, but this version had the opposite effect. You may still be tempted to strap one on if you want the world to know how much you love the game. If you want fun, look elsewhere.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/842702/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> studio id Software are now home to a "wall-to-wall" union according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The organisation have announced that a group of 165 id workers have just voted to unionise, adding to the ranks of the 300 ZeniMax quality assurance staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">unionised back in 2023</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the CWA's press release, Microsoft have already recognised this latest union - which is made up of "developers, artists, programmers, and more" - in accordance with the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/">labour neutrality agreement</a> the two parties agreed in 2022.</p>
<p>"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," said id Software producer and CWA organising committee member Andrew Willis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, id lead services programmer and CWA committee member Chris Hays specifically cited remote staff not being dragged into the office as a reason behind the push for representation. "Remote work isn’t a perk," he said. "It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-is-practically-giving-away-its-140w-usb-c-charger-in-a-holiday-clearance-push-2000652823</link>
            <guid>1381699</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Raise your hand if you’re one of those people with a too-large box or bin full of wall chargers of all shapes and sizes, 90 percent of which you haven’t used in years. It’s OK, that’s pretty much everybody these days, since any new smart device or laptop comes with one, so they accumulate. For the most part, they’re underpowered, undercompatible, and overall underperforming, which is why they live in that box, collecting dust.</p>
<p>One Anker Laptop Charger — a 140W monster with one USB-A and three USB-C ports and an LED screen that shows power output, port-specific details, and temperature data — should allow you to discard that box once and for all. And if you need two or more of them, now’s the time, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">a limited-time Amazon deal has it marked down by 35% to just $65.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four at a Time Charging</h2>
<p>Finding a charger that can fast-charge your laptop and three other devices at the same time — Apple, Android, Samsung, Google, you name it — conjures images of something large and unwieldy. The Anker Laptop Charger is smaller in size than the charging block that comes with MacBooks, and way more versatile. It’s 2.7 inches square with the charging prongs folded down into the body and just 1.42 inches thick, weighing just 9.7 ounces. It’s a tad big to be called pocket-sized, but if you put one in your carry-on or suitcase for a trip, you’ll never want to be without it again.</p>
<p>At that compact size, the Anker Laptop Charger can come with you all day long — start as a bedside plug so you know you’ll wake up with a fully charged smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and laptop. Pop the Anker into your backpack or briefcase as you tackle your day. If one of your devices is running low, just find an AC outlet and the fast, efficient charging will get you back into the green in no time. Bring it back home and it’s ready again for four-device fast charging that’s fast, safe, and universally compatible — that includes handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p>



<h2>Safe and Stable</h2>
<p>A huge pet peeve for anyone using a wall charging block is how easily they’re dislodged from the AC outlet. That’s especially true with multi-port models, because the ports are almost always positioned at the back of the block, away from the wall, where gravity handles the rest and slowly but surely starts to pull the prongs out of the outlet. The Anker’s ports are located at the bottom of the block, thwarting that downward pull, and the block can support up to 10.6 ounces while plugged in — greater than the 9.7 ounce weight of the block itself.</p>
<p>The Anker Laptop Charger is all about consolidating — all of those weaker one-port wall chargers can officially be walked to the curb now, and your travel or work bag won’t miss that enormous laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">While Amazon’s limited-time 35% off deal on the 4-port Anker Laptop Charger is in effect, it’s the $65 charging solution that goes anywhere, anytime.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <guid>1381693</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> just got its first big update and it could be one of the game’s last. Director Masahiro Sakurai previously promised the Switch 2 exclusive wouldn’t be a DLC-fest like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and it sounds like he’s sticking to that. While the new balance patch adjusts a bunch of vehicles and fixed plenty of bugs, the veteran developer said the goal is to not have to keep fiddling with it forever.</p> <p>“As discussed in Air Riders Direct 2, “Kirby’s Air Riders” does not have a production setup for DLC or anything like that,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1999297129186230755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1999297129186230755%7Ctwgr%5Ed405190b081ecd69a1546516d022529f124ffdfe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">wrote on X</a> on December 11, according to the site’s translation. “The team will be disbanding in the near future as well. Therefore, while we still have a short period of time to make adjustments, we’re aiming for a balance that can be enjoyed without issues even years from now. We might be able to tweak it one more time or so, but after that, please enjoy it as the completed balance!”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">エアライダーダイレクト2でお話した通り、『カービィのエアライダー』はDLCなどの制作体制を持ちません。<br>近いうち、チームも解散になります。</p> <p>よって、短い期間で手を打てるうちに､何年後でも問題なく遊べるバランスを目指しています。… <a href="https://t.co/L2JzJHzFb2">https://t.co/L2JzJHzFb2</a></p> <p>— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1999297129186230755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The response from players has mostly been relief. Players responded to the director by noting that they played the original GameCube entry “tirelessly” for years with no updates. “This is how it should be,” wrote another, arguing that its natural to play games for a while and then move one rather than expect them to constantly evolve to hold your attention.</p>

 <p>Rick was the only character that got directly tweaked <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">in the new update</a>. His Rip-Roaring Rick Special was nerfed in the City Trial and Air Ride modes, as was his HP and defense. The game’s various machines, on the other hand, got lots of tweaks. In addition to changes for quick spin to all vehicles, while Star-types were nerfed across the board and Tank-types were buffed.</p>

 <p>My favorite patch note by far, though, is one that shows just how weird game bugs can get. “An error will occur when opening the Gummies screen in the Collection menu when the number of Gummies is between 8,285 and 8,626,” it reads. “This does not occur if there are 8,284 or fewer Gummies or 8,627 or more Gummies.” That issue will be fixed in the next patch. Must be as complicated as it sounds!</p> <p>Sakurai saying the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> team is already getting ready to disband will of course fuel more rumors about his involvement in the next Smash Bros. for Switch 2. But it’s also in keeping with the commitment he outlined back before<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> launched. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” he said back during <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-gunning-for-the-best-racer-of-2025-ive-thrown-everything-i-have-into-this-game-2000638593">one of the Air Rider Directs</a>. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, on the other hand, could really use <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066">a fresh infusion</a> of new content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Budapest Major 2025 played host to a stunning moment as Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut, the Team Vitality frontman, secured his best Major map performance <strong>ever</strong>. This victory came during the win over The MongolZ to kick off the StarLadder Major’s playoffs round, and it landed on Mirage amid the 2-0 sweep that ensured Vitality’s survival.</p>



<p>To secure the map record, ZywOo secured a 2.47 rating, which is the highest he has ever achieved in the Counter-Strike space.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-stunning-performance-from-zywoo-in-budapest">Stunning Performance from ZywOo in Budapest</h2>



<p>ZywOo’s numbers were nothing short of extraordinary. The masterful competitor secured a ratio of 25 kills to just 8 deaths, and his performance was backed by a blistering 135 ADR. His rating was elevated to unseen levels, indicating exactly why Team Vitality was able to so easily overcome The MongolZ, a team now eliminated from the Budapest Major.</p>



<p>Even on the second map, on Dust 2, ZywOo managed to land a rating of 2.18, walking all over the Mongolian squad.</p>



<p>This performance effectively eclipsed his previous best in Budapest, where he secured a 2.05 rating in a fixture against B8 in the earlier Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fans of Vitality are now looking to the next match in the lineup: Vitality vs. Team Spirit. It’s a battle of the titans that will see ZywOo contend with the likes of Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, the prodigy with a mean streak thus far in the event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, all is not well in the world of Call of Duty. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> appears to have struggled for players and sales relatively speaking amid tough competition from the likes of EA’s Battlefield 6 and Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders, and coming out just a year after Black Ops 6. Microsoft is yet to announce a player count or a sales figure for Black Ops 7, nor has it detailed any boost to Game Pass subscriber numbers as a result of its launch. Clearly, it hasn’t met its expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, sales data suggested Black Ops 7 was struggling not just against rival shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>, but also last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Black Ops 6</u></a>. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business</u></a> reported that Black Ops 7’s European launch saw opening week sales down 63% versus Battlefield 6 during the equivalent launch periods for each shooter, and Black Ops 7 also down by more than 50% versus Black Ops 6. All in all, Black Ops 7 had a “terrible” launch, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1991924312287429074" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business’ chief Chris Dring said in a post on social media</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a shock development, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision promised never to release Black Ops or Modern Warfare games back to back again</a>. In a statement attributed to "the Call of Duty team" (Treyarch, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, Raven Software and co.), Activision admitted “that for some of you, the franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision continued: “We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to this week, and Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty has painted a slightly rosier picture. When asked about Black Ops 7's performance by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Booty responded to confirm that it's one of the most-played games on Xbox right now, and that he was proud of what the development team was able to achieve. He then said Call of Duty is “its own unique category” because of Activision’s ability to release content via a seasonal model, so the launch isn’t the end of Black Ops 7’s story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the quote in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Right now, it is one of the most-played games on Xbox. And I’m really proud of what the team did, in terms of feature innovation, moving the franchise forward. Shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And the interesting thing about Call of Duty is, I think that as an IP, it is really well positioned to continue to deliver content for players going forward; the system of seasons. And it’s not just about the launch, but it’s kind of in its own unique category and ability in terms of how the team keeps delivering content throughout the year. So we’re real happy with where we’ve landed with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the doom and gloom, Microsoft has said Call of Duty (overall) ended 2025 as the number one franchise on Game Pass for total players and hours all year, which perhaps doesn’t come as much of a surprise given this is Call of Duty we’re talking about. But it does show that even when Call of Duty has a bad year relative to previous games in the series, it's still massively popular relative to other games.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty is now at something of a crossroads. 2026’s Call of Duty game is almost certainly a continuation of Modern Warfare from Infinity Ward, but what will 2027 bring? Black Ops 8? Activision’s failure to establish a third Call of Duty sub-brand means that it has become overly reliant on Modern Warfare and Black Ops to keep the franchise going at the player numbers executives demand. Could Microsoft take the drastic step of giving Call of Duty a year off to recover from its recent struggles? Given Microsoft paid $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, it seems unlikely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Black Ops 7 in the here and now, Activision has promised "unprecedented season support," saying it "won't rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Kennedy will co-star in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>, the game's developers have confirmed how much we'll be playing as the floppy-hair favorite — and it's good news for his fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, director Akifumi Nakanishi revealed that Requiem features nearly equal screentime between Leon and the previously-revealed Grace Ashcroft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon's playable sections are almost equally split," Nakanishi said, likening the game's structure as similar to Resident Evil: Revelations, which featured both Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together," Nakanishi continued. "Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna (laughs)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nakanishi went on to describe Leon's playable sections as a "release" after the intense horror of playing as the less-experienced Grace. But don't expect Leon's gameplay to be a doddle — as the hero will also put himself in danger to protect others. Surely Capcom won't kill him off?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The battle this time will probably push Leon to his limits more than ever before, and this is a crucial part of the experience," Nakanishi noted. "He's the type who doesn't hesitate to sacrifice himself to save others, but he's not arrogant about it, and he has a passionate inner self. I hope you'll also look forward to the dry wit and subtle sarcasm that only an older guy can bring."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom knows that Leon has a passionate set of fans, and it sounds like the game will lean into that — making him a "handsome" figure who's "cool personality-wise too." Last night's trailer showed him driving  a custom-built Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT, something Capcom has secured an official license from the car company to include.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although he’s a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him to be an 'ikeoji' (a cool/attractive older guy)," Nakanishi concluded. "The reactions to the trailer on that front have made us happy (laughs)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Leon's involvement now being confirmed, Requiem may still have secrets left in store.

                <p>The Switch 2 is a fun console, but one of its shortcomings is that it's not the most ergonomic device for handheld play. That's where CRKD is looking to <em>switch </em>things up, as the company has announced the Nitro Deck 2 for Switch 2 consoles. Even better, it's compatible with the Switch 1 and is scheduled to launch in Spring 2026 in two colorways: White and Smoke Black. Pricing for these have not yet been revealed.</p><div title="6536927 -- CRKD Nitro Deck 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5243" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536927 -- CRKD Nitro Deck 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/crkd.gg\/products\/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition">CRKD Nitro Deck 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/crkd.gg\/products\/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition">Releases Spring 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the original Nitro Deck, the Nitro Deck 2 is designed to be an all-in-one add-on to the Switch 2. The cradle uses a retractable locking mechanism to ensure a tight fit with Switch consoles, and it replaces the Joy-Cons on the sides. The built-in controllers are contoured to fit more naturally in your hands, and they feature an offset right thumbstick for a more ergonomic feel. The console tablet is now held in place with a retractable locking dial located on the rear. It also comes with a legacy adapter for Switch 1 and Switch OLED consoles, as well as another adapter to enable low-latency wired handheld play.</p><p>The capsticks on this model aren't Hall Effect sticks, but CRKD claims they can deliver ultra-responsive control, adjustable resistance, and immunity to magnetic interference thanks to a zero-contact design. Programmable back buttons can also be found on the rear of the Nitro Deck 2, which have been expanded to include L2 and R2 buttons. You can also customize the joysticks with swappable tops, and the triggers have been upgraded to tactile Digital Triggers. The cradle is rounded off with a durable metal kickstand and motion control compatibility.</p><p>When not in use with a Switch console, it can be used as a wireless or wired controller for PC, mobile devices, and smart TVs.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621687" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621687"></a><figcaption>CRKD Nitro Deck 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg"></figure><p>If you're looking to get something right away for your Switch 1 console, the current <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/9A65AE84-0112-4BBA-8228-D36D2EDDC47A?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CRKD Nitro Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/570556D9-ED67-42E7-88BC-DD0885AF34EC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nitro Deck+</a> come highly recommended. These are priced from around $50 - $60 each, and they come in a wide variety of colors like black, PAL grey, and a retro-inspired purple. The regular Nitro Deck features full-size Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, motion controls, rumble, turbo function, curved handles, and is compatible with both the standard and OLED Switch models.</p><p>The Nitro Deck+ has a similar setup, but the key differences with this model include HDMI out support via the USB-C port so that you can put the Switch in docked mode without having to remove it from the cradle, a symmetrical thumbstick layout, an eject function to make removing the screen easier, and improved rumble effects.</p><h3>Nitro Deck</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-Professional-Handheld-Nintendo/dp/B0CFLVJBBD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0DV5MY5R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cuddle Team Leader: Fortnite Edition</a> -- $42.49 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CSG4WPDL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PAL Grey</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CSG44TGV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Pink</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0FQ5S7L7N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Purple</a> -- $43 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0DHVN8GXX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rocket League Silver Edition</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CGMGLHG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $60</li></ul><h3>Nitro Deck+</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0CZY2MDC8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear Black</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8YGPT3G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear Black )with HDMI adapter)</a> -- $50 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0CZY2J5HN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear White</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8ZR8WCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear White (with HDMI adapter)</a> -- $50 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0DV5LL71D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Renegade Raider: Fortnite Edition</a> -- $47 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DHVW45YJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rocket League: Gold Edition</a> -- $43 (<del>$55</del>)</li></ul><p>Several other third-party Switch 2 controllers are also on sale on Amazon right now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The GameSir G8 Plus</a> features an extendable bridge that can cradle a Switch 2 and small tablets, and its traditional controller design makes it comfortable to use.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/</link>
            <guid>1381675</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Today the overwhelming majority of workers at <em>Doom </em>studio id Software – 165 of around 185 total employees – announced that they’re forming a wall-to-wall union in conjunction with Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union that’s aided thousands of game workers across Microsoft in organizing.</p><p>"id Software is historically important – one of the more famous American studios that survived a length of time that few others have,” id Software producer Andrew Willis, who was part of the organizing effort from the jump and filed the initial paperwork to CWA, told Aftermath. “So it feels really awesome to get this done for something with such historical and cultural importance."</p><p>Workers at id began organizing around a year and a half ago, but things kicked into high gear following Microsoft’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane/"><u>unceremonious closure of several Bethesda studios</u></a> in 2024.</p><p>"With Bethesda unionizing, it was a push for people [at id] to start talking, and that's when it started,” id Software lead services programmer Chris Hays told Aftermath. “But then the big push that got it rolling was the closure of Tango [Gameworks] and layoffs within Microsoft at Arkane Austin. It was a wakeup call for a lot of people. People decided that it was time that we took our future into our own hands."</p><blockquote>"The big push that got it rolling was the closure of Tango [Gameworks] and layoffs within Microsoft at Arkane Austin. It was a wakeup call for a lot of people."</blockquote><p>id itself, Hays said, has suffered “a few” layoffs “here and there” in recent years, but nothing comparable to the scale of Zenimax Online Studios, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/"><u>lost hundreds of employees earlier this year</u></a> amid Microsoft’s latest round of mass layoffs and project cancellations. Now, he believes, is the time to secure workers’ rights – before the scythe swings, as opposed to after.</p><p>"Not that we're not scared that [layoffs] will one day come," said Hays. "In fact, avoiding each of the previous rounds has made us more anxious about if the next round will be us. And the most recent round of layoffs happened after several [studios] had already organized. People [at id] can see what it was that they got. We got to see them negotiating where they didn't actually lose their jobs [for a couple months]. They were still on payroll. They still had their health insurance. ... They had the extra time to make sure they could get their lives [in order], and many have actually gotten their jobs back through negotiations on where they could place people in the company."&nbsp;</p><p>CWA has been able to successfully unionize so many studios within Microsoft and Activision Blizzard in large part due to <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a legally binding neutrality agreement</u></a> it struck with the company in 2022 when it was facing regulatory scrutiny over its $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard. That deal lapsed earlier this year, but according to Hays, only on the Activision Blizzard side of things.</p><p>"For us under Zenimax, there's actually a separate neutrality agreement, and that one is still valid until May [2026]," said Hays. "But that was definitely on our minds when we were looking at when we wanted to think that we had enough support [to unionize]. … We knew that it was really special for us to have the neutrality agreement, to have the freedom to be able to talk to each other more openly and not face the kind of pushback you would have in other unionization campaigns. We wanted to make sure that we took advantage of the benefit while we had it."</p><p>While the union plans to conduct a bargaining survey before members go to the table with Microsoft to hammer out a contract, preliminary discussions have focused on a few pillars: benefits, remote work, and AI.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a lot of blind spots in our benefits, and a lot of us don't know what we have and what we don't and where things are lacking,” said Hays. “When talking with a lot of people, some would say 'Oh, I think we're lacking this particular kind of benefit, or something around child care.' Personally, I'm really motivated to get protections around remote work and responsible use of AI."</p><blockquote>"There's definitely a directive from Microsoft to use [AI] more.”</blockquote><p>Remote work has been <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs/"><u>a sticking point</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs/"><u>at multiple Microsoft studios</u></a>, with many issuing return-to-office mandates despite teams’ demonstrable success collaborating from across the country – and even the globe – in 2020 and 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>"We actually launched <em>Doom Eternal</em> during covid,” said Hays. “The month of [the launch], we started our work from home. ... We did a launch event, the whole internet fell apart, and we had to learn how to do all of that remote. And then starting a project [<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>] from the beginning, all remote, we learned a lot of lessons. On my team, we learned to change how we work, to be more remote friendly. We ended up becoming more productive as a result. So we've done this before. We've learned lessons, and I think we can continue to use that. We shouldn't just throw away all the great wins we got with remote work."</p><p>As for AI, Willis was cagey about precisely how it’s being used within id, noting that going into specifics would involve divulging secrets about proprietary tech. But he said that in his view, some of the current applications are “good,” while others are… less so.</p><p>"There's definitely a directive from Microsoft to use [AI] more,” Willis said. “In what ways and how careful they're being about implementing it within the studio to actually benefit the creation of a better game or a more efficient process, I personally don't think that's being done in a careful enough way to have it be beneficial.”</p><p>Last year, the Zenimax QA union <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights/"><u>secured AI protections</u></a> that commit the company to uses of AI that "augment human ingenuity and capacities ... without causing workers harm" and require that Zenimax provides notice to the union in cases where "AI implementation may impact the work of union members and to bargain those impacts upon request." Willis and Hays hope the new union can make something similar happen under id’s roof.</p><p>"We are going to be in a fortunate position in that we have a lot of other people who've gone through this,” said Hays, “so we can look at what they have bargained for, especially around AI, and take that as a starting place, which hopefully means that it's going to be easier for us than anyone before."</p><p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/04/irish-authorities-asked-to-investigate-microsoft-over-alleged-unlawful-data-processing-by-idf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>support of Israel’s genocide in Gaza</u></a> – which <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/12/11/gaza_winter_storm_byron_flooding?ref=aftermath.site"><u>continues</u></a> despite a supposed ceasefire – is also potentially on the docket.</p><p>"It would be difficult to say [if we’ll make Israel a core bargaining issue] without seeing what the bargaining surveys comment on, but I can say for myself personally that, yeah, I want no part in [Israel's] usage of Microsoft tools and the deals between Israel and Microsoft," said Willis.</p><blockquote>"The folks that are in charge of a lot of these decision-making processes, it's a lot of Ivy League MBAs, a lot of folks with zero game experience."</blockquote><p>More broadly, Willis believes the union will allow for more input from developers, as opposed to execs who have never shipped a game and, indeed, might not play them at all.</p><p>"We see the direction the industry is headed,” said Willis. “The folks that are in charge of a lot of these decision-making processes, it's a lot of Ivy League MBAs, a lot of folks with zero game experience – not just from the management standpoint, but zero experience in actually making games. ... I find little evidence of them really enjoying games or playing games personally."</p><p>“I think the more video game studios that unionize, and the greater percentage of video game employees that are in a union, it's not just better for them as individuals or folks that are raising families or have mortgages; it keeps talent from shedding,” he added. “You get to keep people in the industry who have experience and the amount of game credits that allow them to do things and create games that a contract-only or much more volatile workforce simply couldn't.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/"><div><p>Months After Microsoft Layoffs, Zenimax Unions Never Stopped Fighting For Impacted Workers - Aftermath</p><p>In the months following Microsoft’s July 2025 layoffs, unionized workers at Zenimax have refused to simply roll over and accept their fates.</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>As ever, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY">Day of the Devs</a> was on hand to highlight a bunch of upcoming indies that we can look forward to in the next year or two. It was a slightly slimmer showing on the Switch front than we have seen in previous years (at least, as far as <em>confirmed</em> Switch releases go), but there were still two titles that have already announced a Switch (2) launch.</p>
<p>First up, we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rockbeasts">Rockbeasts</a>, a '90s "rock-and-roll management RPG", that sees you put in charge of a grunge rock band comprised of anthropomorphised wilderbeast... and a fish. It sounds like a lot, and it looks like it, too. The gameplay has a bit of everything — rhythm games, management sims, visual novels — and the whole thing has a visual style that looks like it's just stumbled out of a <strong>Bojack Horseman</strong> episode.</p>
<p>In short, we're <em>very</em> interested to find out more. Rockbeasts doesn't have a firm release date at the time of writing, but the devs <em>did</em> confirm that it will be launching on Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Rock on, dude!</p>

<p>The second Switch game showcased in the latest Day of the Devs was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demon_tides">Demon Tides</a>. You might remember this one from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-edition-2024-every-announcement-confirmed-switch-games#demon-tides-2025-switch-unconfirmed">last year's DotD event</a>, and yes, it still looks awesome. This is the next 3D platformer from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a> dev Fabraz, combining super slick-looking movement with the most toe-tapping of hip-hop scores.</p>
<p>Once again, there's no Switch release date for this one just yet, though Fabraz has confirmed that Fangamer will be handling a <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1998833988883107978">physical release</a>, so that's something to look forward to!</p>

<p>Naturally, there's every chance that we will see a fair few of the other games from the latest Day of the Devs showcase pop up on Switch at some point down the line. Switch 2 is still very much the new kid in town, so we'd be surprised if indie devs don't want to capitalise on its relative hotness and bring their titles over.</p>
<p>We've added the full Day of the Devs: The Game Awards 2025 Edition showcase below, so you can take a look at all the games revealed and make your own predictions about whether they will be heading to Switch or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/holiday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store Holiday sale</a> has just started, mere weeks after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday/Cyber Monday one</a>, and it begins with a big freebie: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hogwarts-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Avalanche Software's acclaimed open world third-person action/adventure game released in 2023 can be added permanently to your Epic Games Store library through December 18 at 5 PM.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Epic Games has partnered with publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (which might be sold to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, depending on which company gets Warner Bros.) to promote Hogwarts Legacy across its games. Players who spend at least two hours in the world of Hogwarts Legacy (via the Epic Games Store) by December 18 at 11 AM Eastern Time can earn the Chocolate Frog Back Bling in Fortnite. This, of course, also applies to those who may have previously purchased the game via the store and spent two or more hours in the game. Later in December, the Fortnite Shop will feature outfits and accessories inspired by the Wizarding World. Players can customize each outfit to represent one of the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G773K-qWkAAiJWZ-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Rocket League is also celebrating the Harry Potter franchise as part of its annual Frosty Fest event. In the Hogwarts House Rivalry, players earn points by playing matches while representing a house. Players will also be able to celebrate their favourite house with challenge rewards and shop items. More details will be announced later this month.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game in 2023</a>, beating even Call of Duty that year. <span>A Definitive Edition featuring additional content&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank">was reportedly in the works</a>&nbsp;with the help of Rocksteady; however, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled this project</a>.</span> </p>



<p>A sequel was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-wb-games-biggest-priority-but-itll-take-a-couple-of-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to be WBIE's top priority, which was no surprise given its excellent sales (over 35 million units to date). Of course, it will take some time to materialize. Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in February 2023</a> and received support for a while; taking a guess, Avalanche Software could be targeting a launch for the sequel at some point in 2028.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-this-15-6-portable-monitor-at-its-lowest-price-since-launch-for-a-year-end-sale-already-selling-out-fast-2000652662</link>
            <guid>1381666</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re a multitasker looking to expand your viewing area for better productivity, adding a portable monitor to your setup can be a smart move. These are easy to carry with you on the go and convenient to set up literally anywhere you want, plus most options fall into a fairly affordable range. Thankfully, there’s a way to bring one home for even less today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/">Right now, you can grab the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after Amazon generously dropped it by 44%</a>. The discount lets you save a whopping $45 on your purchase, and there is no shipping fee to worry about, either. However, while the retailer hasn’t specified an expiry date for the offer, we’re not expecting it to be around for long. It’s best to get yours in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Visuals on a Bright Screen</h2>
<p>For under $60, you’re getting a 15.6-inch display. The size matches most standard laptops, so it’ll instantly feel quite familiar. It pushes a resolution of 1920x1080P, which is paired with HDR technology to expand the overall brightness and color range in content. You’ll enjoy better color accuracy, with brighter whites and deeper blacks for a more lifelike visual experience, regardless of what you’re using the monitor for.</p>
<p>The screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle that delivers consistent visuals from every side, so you don’t exactly need to sit directly in the front to see what’s happening. It’s especially handy when you’re sharing the monitor with a bunch of people, as everyone will be able to see it clearly without awkwardly shifting around. The built-in speaker takes care of the sound, while the low blue light support lets you use the screen for an extended period without compromising your eye health. The latter is something those who often pull all-nighters will appreciate.</p>



<p>InnoView monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective cover made of durable PU leather, which not only keeps it safe from daily wear and tear but also doubles as a stand to prop the thing up. It features two grooves that are used to adjust the angle of the screen based on what you require. Maybe keep it upright when you’re using it at your desk, or tilt it back for a more relaxed angle while streaming your favorite show or catching up with friends on a video call!</p>
<p>As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices (HP laptop, Lenovo laptop, Dell laptop, Asus laptop, Macbook, iPhone, game console, tablet, PS, Xbox, etc), as long as they support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-MODE. The two fully-functional Type-C ports and one HDMI port offer a straightforward plug-and-play functionality, which makes it easy to get started with using the monitor right away.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to reduce frequent window/tab hopping and enjoy more screen space, we highly recommend adding a portable monitor to your setup. With this one, you can work with multiple programs at the same time, instead of juggling everything on your main display. You can also extend your phone’s visuals when taking a video call, plus play your favorite games remotely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/">This deal brings its price down to $57, but it’s likely going to expire soon. It’s best to snap yours before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</a> That said, now is also a good time to stock up on other tech essentials like earbuds and tablets, since there’s plenty going at a discount. We’ve been covering the best deals that are actually worth your money, so be sure to check back for the latest drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The homestretch of the 2025 holiday shopping season is going to be full of surprises, flash deals, and more as manufacturers pull out all the stops to hit their year-end numbers. That’s good news for shoppers, as anyone on the hunt for a great new smartwatch will see when they notice this Amazon deal on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">One of the best new wearables of 2025, the big 46mm model of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is at its all-time low price right now, just $400.</a></p>
<p>Amazon’s red-flagged this 20%-off deal with a big “selling fast” sign, which could very well mean a rapidly shrinking inventory that could cause the deal to vanish as suddenly as it appeared. Not surprising, considering how the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is one of the best Android smartwatches at its original $500 price point, and now it’s $100 under that number.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Shape Shifter</h2>
<p>One of the cool features of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is that it’s designed to take on an elegant, traditional look, complete with a detailed rotating bezel that directs you to your apps, and a face that looks like a luxury chronograph even when you get up close to it. With that face, the beautiful stainless steel bezel and crown, and a black eco leather and band, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is perfectly at home on a date or at a formal occasion.</p>
<p>Its best work, of course, happens when you’re active, and in need of a reliable health and workout tracker with a robust suite of apps and features. It has a built-in Running Coach feature that takes into account your age, weight, heart rate, and even your oxygen level as you run, keeping you at a pace that works for both your fitness and training goals and your overall health. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic also has one of the better Sleep Coaching features of any midrange smartwatch, along with helpful metrics that aren’t commonly found in smartwatches like Vascular Load readings to track the amount of stress on your heart, and an Antioxidant Index that tracks the level of antioxidants in your body to help inform your food and lifestyle choices.</p>



<h2>Smart, Watch</h2>
<p>Any Samsung Galaxy smartwatch is going to come loaded with the best smart tech and interactivity with the rest of the Samsung universe. That means Galaxy AI and Google Gemini to serve as your hands-free assistants on the go whenever you need something, instant updates from your calendar and any other app you want to keep abreast of, and of course seamless connections to the Samsung family of smartphones, wireless earbuds, tablets, and laptops.</p>
<p>Call this Amazon deal one of the better somewhat-last-minute finds of the holiday shopping season. But whatever you call it, do it soon, because t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">he 46mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is flying out of inventory faster than anticipated at its all-time low price of $400.</a></p>

            <p>
I have to say, it does tickle me that pretty much anyone involved with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> just seem to still want to make Left 4 Dead. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-anacrusis">The Anacrusis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> both were made by folks who worked on the original co-op shooter, and now the original lead designer of it Mike Booth is back with yet another incarnation, 4:Loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-dev-mike-booth-has-teamed-up-with-jj-abrams-to-make-another-four-player-shooter-with-purple-aliens-this-time">revealed at Geoff's Ads and Statues Evening</a>. As part of that reveal, Booth took part in a little interview over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/">PlayStation Blog</a> where he touched on the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> mechanics, and how excited he is for people to break them.
</p>
<p>
Booth explained that he's been a fan of roguelikes since the original Rogue, and how the genre appeals to him because of the ways you can be creative in achieving certain goals. "Some runs even feel like you have such a great combination of tools that you 'break the game,'" Booth said, also noting that with 4:Loop he does still just want to let people "jump in and play."
</p>
<p>
We'll come back to that game breaking stuff in a moment, but first here's how Booth explains the core loop. Essentially, you and three of your buds need to try and destroy an alien mothership, with each mission you embark on letting you make different choices to improve equipment. Along the way, you might pick up certain items that help you out in tricky scenarios.
</p>
<p>
One such scenario Booth described was an instance where a playtester was trying to outrun a lethal beam of some sort that basically means game over if you can't get to the escape zone in time. Said playtester had picked up an item called a blink berry, which you can sort of throw like a grenade, and wherever it lands it'll teleport whatever it hits to somewhere random. So, the playtester threw it at themself, was teleported away, and made it to the escape zone in time.
</p><p>
"I built both of those game mechanics and had never even considered that strategy," Booth said. "I’m excited to see how our gaming community 'breaks the game' in other unexpected ways." Apparently there's bit of "meta-progression" where you learn things about the world and how it works that "give you an edge for your next run."
</p>
<p>
From the sounds of things it won't be a full-on roguelike, maybe more towards a roguelite, something to keep runs fresh rather than just taking hordes of aliens on over and over again. No release date attached to this one yet, so, just keep replaying Left 4 Dead like you I'm assuming you already do.

              <p>Apple unveiled its latest pair of earbuds – the Apple AirPods Pro 3 – in September this year, and our audio experts loved the upgrades these brought. They launched at the standard $249 price, but we just spotted a deal that lets you pick them up for less today.</p>
<p>Amazon has now dropped the AirPods Pro 3 to $199, after taking 20% off, bringing the pair back to its lowest price ever. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, and placing your orders today can help you get them just in time for Christmas. If you’ve been meaning to upgrade your audio gear, or surprise a music lover in your life this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Sound, Better ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>These look quite similar to AirPods Pro 2, but feature a slightly redesigned shape with new foam-infused silicone ear tips for a better fit. The new acoustic architecture gives sound quality a boost, delivering rich, deep audio that lets you enjoy your favorite tracks and podcasts with detailed clarity. It lets you feel every instrument, with vivid vocals like never before.</p>
<p>Active noise cancellation capabilities have improved, too, as this pair is capable of removing up to 2x more unwanted noise than AirPods Pro 2; great for when you want to stay fully immersed in the moment with your favorite track playing. The ANC mode works well when you don’t want background sounds to distract you. You can enable it when you’re working in a busy cafe or trying to focus on an important task in the office. Of course, this level of noise blocking doesn’t work for every situation – sometimes it’s better to stay present and aware of what’s happening around. For that, there’s the transparency mode, which lets some ambient sound in.</p>



<p>Regardless of the mode, AirPods Pro 3 customize the sound signature for your unique ear geometry and fit with its next-generation Adaptive EQ. What’s more, these protect your hearing health, too. You can take an at-home hearing test that checks your hearing in a broader range of everyday conditions, or use the pair as a hearing aid when you need the voices around you amplified. Those often exposed to loud environmental noise can put them on to prevent hearing loss as well. Other health features include heart rate sensing, which monitors your heart rate, plus calories burned for up to 50 different workout types.</p>
<p>Another solid selling point is the Live Translation feature, which uses Apple Intelligence to offer real-time translation for face-to-face conversations around the world. Basically, the earbuds pick up on what someone is saying and translate it instantly, letting you reply in your preferred language using your iPhone or their AirPods. As for the battery life, you’ll enjoy up to 8 hours of listening on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation on, and up to 10 hours in Transparency using the Hearing Aid feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">This deal brings the price of this feature-packed pair to $199, from $249</a>. It’s a big discount, sure, considering how these just launched, it’s still a welcome drop. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly before it wraps up. Ordering now will also help you enjoy free shipping with your purchase!</p>

<p>Shipping Spring 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've had mixed opinions on the CRKD Nitro Deck for the Switch, but now the company has come out swinging with a brand new iteration – and it's compatible with both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nitro Deck 2</strong> starts shipping in <strong>Spring 2026</strong> and looks to be a significant upgrade over the previous model. It seems the company has the Switch 2 in mind with this new product, but those still on the original Switch can still get in on the action. You'll just need to utilise the additional centrepiece to make up for the height difference, while turning the dial on the back to decrease the length of the chassis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Deck 2 has offset analogue sticks which, for the first time, aren't situation directly above and below the d-pad and face buttons. They utilise capacitor-based technology are said to be free from potential drifting issues. It also features additional back buttons, adjustable deadzones, turbo mode, and more.</p>
<p>The d-pad design and stick tops can also be swapped out, but be mindful that these additional parts are sold separately.</p>

<p>Pricing is confirmed at <strong>£89.99</strong> for the Nitro Deck 2 itself, while any addition d-pad/stick packs are <strong>£19.99</strong> each. Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">CRKD website</a>.</p>
