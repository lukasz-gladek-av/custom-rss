<p>Company is now offering replacements for all customers</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dbrand" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fc56ae4287071/dbrand.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Dbrand has admitted that its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">initial response to the Joy-Con detachment debacle</a> surrounding its new 'Killswitch' product was "spectacularly terrible".</p>
<p>If you're unaware, the Killswitch came under fire for supposedly causing the Switch 2's Joy-Con to detach from the console too easily when applied. Dbrand had attempted to defend this by laying out the conditions under which the detachment might occur, ultimately stating that "nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this".</p>
<p>Fans understandably took this to mean that Dbrand was shirking responsibility and shifting the blame to the users. It's not taken long for the company to catch wind of this, and so it has now issued an updated response on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dbrand-is-sending-improved-switch-2-grips-to-all-customers-after-spectacularly-terrible-response-to-detaching-claims/">VGC</a>) in which it finally takes full responsibility while offering replacements to all customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After reading through your feedback, it’s quite clear that our post was a spectacularly terrible response to the issue at hand. Some of you have expressed that opinion in a perfectly reasonable way. Others have expressed it with literal death threats."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dbrand goes on to say that while it still believes detachment would only occur under certain conditions, it ultimately agrees that this shouldn't necessarily matter, and that users should be able to hold the console and Killswitch in whatever manner they see fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As easy as it is to boil our original post down to <em>“you’re holding it wrong,”</em> what we’re sober to now is the point that <em>you should be allowed to hold it however the f*** you want, without detachment occurring.</em> We get it. Please continue dunking on us for the next six to eight months for reincarnating Steve Jobs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company is currently looking at two potential solutions for the issue: the first is a complete redesign of the accessory that would theoretically completely resolve any potential detachment issues. Dband is not 100% certain that this option would be feasible to mass-produce at this time, but it is nevertheless giving it a shot.</p>
<p>The second is simply an improved version of the current product, which would still prove to be a lot more reliable than some of the products currently in users' hands. Whichever option Dbrand ultimately opts for will be communicated in a new update on <strong>10th July 2025</strong>. Regardless, everyone – whether you encountered the detachment issue or not – will be getting a replacement product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What we are 100% committed to is getting everyone replacement Joy-Cons ASAP, regardless of whether they’re severely affected, haven’t experienced the issue, have emailed us a dozen times, or have no clue about any of this."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display has been bashed a few times already since the console's release earlier this month, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB67B8LCorI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest analysis from Monitor Unboxed</a> is perhaps even more damning. We already knew of the nearly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-existent HDR capabilities</a> and of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variable Refresh Rate issues</a>, but Monitor Unboxed, which regularly reviews PC displays, has now measured the screen's response time, and the results are really disappointing.</p>
<p>While the channel couldn't perform testing with their usual tools for monitors, they manually conducted a series of 20 gray-to-gray transitions to measure the response time of the Nintendo Switch 2 display set to 60Hz (as there are no current games that support the maximum 120Hz). The test's average was 33 milliseconds, which makes the screen far slower than typical PC monitors that range between 6 and 20 milliseconds. What's even more surprising, though, is that the display is around 50% slower even than the original Nintendo Switch, which measured 21 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Monitor Unboxed postulates that one of the reasons behind this underwhelming measurement could be the lack of Overdrive technology, which is pretty much mandatory on most displays nowadays but would require higher voltage, which, in turn, would affect the device's overall battery life, a critical feature of a handheld console. This is especially important for the Nintendo Switch 2 since it already comes with a larger display (7.9 inches versus 6.2), a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p), and higher brightness (430 nits versus 310 nits) compared to the original Nintendo Switch, all of which impact the battery life.</p>
<p>Because the display's response time is approximately twice the 16.7 ms frame interval at 60 Hz, it cannot fully update before the next refresh. This results in persistent blur trails and poor motion clarity, as seen in the <a href="https://www.testufo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blur Busters UFO test</a> performed in the video. Furthermore, Monitor Unboxed reckons that the 120 Hz capability will not significantly improve motion since the panel cannot keep up with the faster refresh cycles anyway.</p>
<p>The only real solution to this issue will be an OLED Nintendo Switch 2 display, which will inevitably offer far superior response times (and, therefore, motion clarity), not to mention greatly superior contrast, which will also improve the console's mediocre HDR representation. Meanwhile, pretty much the only upside to the current LCD screen (other than the aforementioned improvements) compared to the original Switch is its far better wide color gamut support, which covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color space, up from the 79% of the previous console.</p>
<p>Despite all these shortcomings, the console is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling like hotcakes</a>, proving that most of Nintendo's user base doesn't really care about such topics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rematch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap's newly launched football action title - has dribbled and passed its way to an impressive player and sales milestone, less than one week since the game's debut.</p>
<p>The game has surpassed 1m sales since its release. What's more, the studio also announced Rematch has already reached three million "unique" players since its launch on 19th June, thanks to it being available on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>. </p>
<p>Those three million players have played 11.8m matches, while 55.6m goals have been scored. That number will likely be getting higher even as I type, given that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">over on Steam</a> there are currently still 19,008 footy fans kicking about in the game.</p>

<p>Additionally, Slocap said there have been 33.5m assists in Rematch, and 69 (nice).1m saves. "This is just the beginning," <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1937571625752236446">Slocap wrote</a>, celebrating the latest Rematch numbers. "Thank you for being with us, in and out of the pitch!"</p>
<p>While it has undeniably had a successful debut, one thing missing from Rematch currently is crossplay. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/adding-crossplay-to-rematch-is-our-absolute-highest-priority-says-sloclap">Sloclap said adding crossplay was its"absolute highest priority"</a>.</p>
<p>"We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress," the studio said at the time.</p>

<p>Our Tom is one of those three million Rematch players, and he has been having a good old time with it. He does wish, however, that fellow Rematch players learn one important thing: passing the ball.</p>
<p>"I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3’s release, the finale of what has been a wonderful pet project (pun intended) for CyberConnect2 is finally here. Throwing a group of cartoon children into the horrors of a war loosely based upon World War II was a bold choice, but it has spawned a trilogy of hopeful stories of survival against insurmountable odds. Here, with the final title, the developers round off this tale set in the Little Tail Bronx universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 - Official Trailer  #Fuga3 #FugaMelodiesOfSteel3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/If5Lzf_M9KU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Kicking off with what are honestly the most harrowing scenes of the series, Fuga 3 settles into its core narrative, after some obligatory time travel shenanigans. Malt, the leader of the children, is abducted by the Berman Empire, who are gearing up for another invasion of Gasco. The remaining children are drawn to the Taranis, a gigantic tank that we last saw falling through the sea of clouds in Fuga 2. Once aboard, they set out through Gasco to rescue Malt, stop the Berman Empire and topple the villainous Kaiser.</p>


<p>Returning from Fuga 2 is the ability from the start to view summaries of the entire story so far, so you don’t even need to play the previous titles to follow the narrative of this title. I would still recommend playing the others, as it gives a better understanding of how the core mechanics of these games work. It also impresses upon the player the relationship between the characters and makes the harsher elements of the story hit all the harder. But I ain’t your keeper, so do what you want.</p>


<p>The gameplay here is largely the same as the previous titles, with all the turn-based strategy and life-sim elements you’ve come to expect. Once again, you’ll be blowing holes in tanks of steadily increasing size and power, capitalising on their weaknesses to delay their turns. If you find yourself right up against it, the Soul Cannon still allows you to use the soul and life of one of the children to win any battle, which is especially grim when, in the downtime between battles, you’re performing tasks on the Taranis to aid you in future battles from farming, to cooking, to simply chatting with the kids.</p>
<p>Performing these tasks during the Intermission segments provides bonuses like improving the relationships between the children, which unlocks powerful new attacks, and eating specifically grants your entire team buffs for the upcoming battles. Returning from previous games is the Notebook&nbsp;that lists the specific activities&nbsp;the children want to do, which grants substantial EXP boosts and raises their spirits for future battles.</p>

<p>With this being the epic conclusion of the trilogy, the battles have been buffed to an incredible sheen. On top of all the mechanics of previous games, CyberConnect2 has worked to provide interplay between – and additions to – the existing gameplay of the series. The best addition that develops on the existing mechanics is that Leader Skills can now be performed by all of the children instead of just Malt. Although these can’t be chosen as actions, they activate in response to what is happening in the battle, so their timing is often absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>The first of the new mechanics of Fuga 3 is the Combo Chance, which allows you to chain hits against enemy weaknesses to multiply the damage of your next hit. It caps at 200%, but believe me that a double damage cannon blast will absolutely get the job done. This instils a more dynamic use of switching the children around at far more regular intervals than the previous games and it also resulted in me using children in battle that I rarely used in the first two games, like Wappa or Chick.</p>
<p>The second new mechanic builds on the wealth of characters from the series outside of the core cast&nbsp;to provide Assist Attacks. Based on your decisions in the game at key narrative points, you can unlock the ability to bring in specific characters to support you with a variety of features from wiping out enemy armour to increasing the defence of the Taranis. Then, during the gameplay, you can land on Transmission Events, where these support players request conversations with specific characters on the Taranis to increase the potency of their Assist Attacks.</p>

<p>These are great additions, but the third new mechanic that doesn’t land quite as well for me. Hitting weaknesses builds a gauge ending in a cute little pixel heart. The moment you hit that heart, a very powerful attack will activate automatically, which is where my problem with it lies. You have no easy way to manipulate this, so this attack is often wasted. It’s not a dealbreaker, of course, but when all the other mechanics blend in so well, it’s disappointing to have one that doesn’t fit into an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Visually, Fuga 3 is much the same as the previous games, employing the same beautiful watercolour artstyle and showing developments of the characters through small changes to their visual design. There are subtle changes, such as the attack effects looking far more flashy than previous titles, but otherwise this is the same Fuga. This isn’t a bad thing, as they nailed the visuals (and the sound for that matter) from the first game in my opinion, so more of the same is an excellent thing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Swapping Spree]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ruffy-and-riverside-review-swapping-spree</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-swapping-spree.1227690/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>is a 3D platformer in which you play as a bear and his diminutive flying companion. Together, you must explore a series of semi-linear environments, searching for collectibles and meeting the world's wacky but lovable inhabitants.</p>

<p>If all of this is starting to sound familiar, it's because you've played&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>&nbsp;or its sequel&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, and that's a comparison&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>developer Zockrates Laboratories is eager to encourage. There's even a little nod to the bear and bird in one of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy</em>'s secret areas.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>isn't just a <i>Banjo&nbsp;</i>knockoff (a&nbsp;<em>Banjo&nbsp;</em>riff, if you will). It's got a rather clever and unique central mechanic that differentiates it from its closest inspirations, and that's just enough to elevate it above mere homage, even while certain elements grate.</p>

<h2><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Offers Fun Throwback 3D Platforming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-beach.jpg?itok=DCyYEYo0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-beach.jpg?itok=Cf_GA7Yf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's plenty of 3D platforming fun to be had in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>is a 3D collectathon platformer that has you combing large, semi-open areas for various goodies. It's very much in the spirit of its forebears (no pun intended); you'll feel right at home here if you're a fan of the aforementioned <i>Banjo&nbsp;</i>games, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow"><em>Spyro the Dragon</em></a>.</p>

<p>As a 3D platformer,&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>works perfectly well. Its controls are solid, its levels are packed with things to see and do, and it's got plenty of wacky offbeat characters to enjoy as well.</p>

<p>The central hub, the titular Riverside, is probably where you'll be spending most of your time when it comes to hunting for secrets and sidequest objectives. It boasts that all-important "ooh, what's that?" factor; you'll be chasing down one sidequest, then you'll get hopelessly sidetracked by other quests and ambient puzzles.</p>

<p>It's all wrapped up in a charming papercraft aesthetic that calls to mind Nintendo's RPG classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-version-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct" rel="nofollow"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, as well as descendants like&nbsp;<em>Bug Fables</em>. It's big, colorful, and simple, which is exactly how games like this should look.</p>

<h2>Swapping in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Works Well</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-puzzle.jpg?itok=nBhH7AJ1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-puzzle.jpg?itok=Kx6zoTcO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Swapping leads to some fun puzzles in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>'s puzzles are driven by its core swap mechanic, which is nice and simple. Some objects have textures you can swap with others. That's pretty much it, but it's the driving engine behind some pretty clever and fun challenges.</p>

<p>For instance, you might come across a weight that's too heavy to lift, so you'll need to swap its current stone texture with a wooden one to allow you to move it out of your way. Alternatively, to get the upper hand in a race, you may need to swap water with mud that will slow your rivals down.</p>

<p>While the number of textures you can swap is limited - you cannot, for instance, steal the texture of a brick wall, or of a living creature - you can swap most objects' colors, and some puzzles call for you to do just that. It's fun to play around with textures to solve puzzles, but it's also fun just to experiment with swapping on your own.</p>

<p>Swapping also forms the basis of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>'s all-too-brief boss battles, and while I don't want to spoil, suffice it to say the mechanic is used in some pretty interesting ways to help Ruffy defeat his foes. You'll pretty much never just be punching bosses to death here.</p>

<h2><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Won't Shut Up</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-dialogue.jpg?itok=D97cxbl3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-dialogue.jpg?itok=WbpJ0zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is just one of way, way too many dialogue lines in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, while the collectathon and swapping elements of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>work well, there's one area where it decisively stumbles, and that's the story. You might think the narrative in a game like this isn't particularly important, but sadly, that's an opinion Zockrates Laboratories doesn't seem to share.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, none of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>'s characters will shut up. One line of dialogue will never suffice; every conversation drags on interminably, with characters often repeating sentiments or concepts, presumably to check you haven't fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Narratively speaking, your quest is to save Riverside and its surroundings from a giant evil cube called Groll. There's no real depth or complexity beyond that setup; Groll bad, your team good, beat up cube to win.</p>

<p><em>Ruffy</em>'s story isn't particularly deep or interesting, and its dialogue isn't terribly amusing either, although I did get one or two chuckles out of some of the more left-field jokes. On the whole, though, there's really no need for the story to take center stage like this.</p>

<h2>Story Often Dictates Exploration in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-story-puzzle.jpg?itok=lYU9WHNT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-story-puzzle.jpg?itok=fwjRELr8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't look so happy, Ruffy. There's literally no point in you being in here.</figcaption></figure><p>The suffocating presence of the story proves to be a problem in the exploration elements of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>as well. All too often, I'd be wandering around Riverside, looking for puzzles I could solve, when I'd happen upon a particularly interesting conundrum.</p>

<p>I'd spend a few minutes trying to work out how to solve said head-scratcher, before mentally filing it under "return later" and being distracted by a passing collectible. Upon progressing the story, I'd then discover this was a puzzle I literally couldn't solve until the narrative gave me what I needed.</p>

<p>This proved extremely frustrating, and it stopped me from wanting to explore levels; after all, why try to solve puzzles when there's no reason to believe I've got all the pieces? In fairness, there are still many optional areas and challenges waiting for you in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>, but those roadblocks are too numerous to fully relax.</p>

<p>I don't want <em>Ruffy&nbsp;</em>to be <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-wilds-review-groundhog-universe" rel="nofollow">The Outer Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/elden-ring-open-world-changes-soulsborne-formula" rel="nofollow"><i>Elden Ring</i></a>,&nbsp;but coming across these roadblocks is demoralizing and strange. It feels like the level designers haven't quite finished building the stage yet, and they want you to go away so they can finish the job.</p>

<h2><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

It's a fun enough way to while away a few hours, and its central hub is fun to explore. With a little more organic exploration and a lot less dialogue, this formula could really shine. As it stands, though, too many words, your honor.</p>

			<p>It's game over for Hytale, the long-awaited Minecraft-style sandbox game, and its studio, Hypixel. The news was <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> this week on the game's official website, where Director Aaron Donaghey wrote:</p>
<p><em>Game development is brutally hard - especially when you’re trying to build something original that speaks to a creative, passionate community. Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</em></p>
<p>The game was going to be set in a procedurally generated fantasy world featuring RPG-style combat and dungeons. Of course, as you'd expect in a Minecraft-inspired game, there would also be block-based construction and mods. Hytale would have been published by Riot Games, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Hypixel Studios in April 2020. In the cancellation letter, Hypixel thanked Riot for their support of the personnel following this transition:</p>
<p><em>We’re also deeply grateful to Riot - not just for the years of support and the opportunities they gave us, but for the care they’re showing our team during this transition. They supported us in going out into the world to see if there were investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward. And now, as we begin winding things down, they’re ensuring our team is supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next. It’s not just thoughtful - it’s human. And it shows a genuine effort to take care of the people behind the work.</em></p>
<p>The original Hypixel server in Minecraft is not affected and will remain operational.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Palworld x Terraria update has launched, bringing fishing, salvaging, bigger towns, a Pal trust mechanic and more in one of the biggest patches the game has seen since its early access release last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update v0.6.0 adds the collaboration with Terraria, Re-Logic’s hugely popular sandbox game. It includes a unique dungeon featuring enemies from Terraria, and the ability to collect materials in the dungeon to create equipment from the world of the game. The Moon Lord, a boss from Terraria, is now a raid boss in Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Terraria content is just one part of the update itself. Not only are there PlayStation 5 dedicated servers, but a number of new features. These include fishing, a salvage system, three new types of islands, a Pal trust mechanic, and the level cap raising from 60 to 65. All that and more is detailed in the patch notes, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld developer Pocketpair continues to release major updates to the game even as it battles Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent lawsuit. And the lawsuit has affected the game. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-says-its-being-forced-to-patch-the-game-due-to-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-lawsuit"><u>Pocketpair admitted that recent patches made changes to the game that were forced upon it as a result of the ongoing litigation</u></a>. As you’d perhaps expect, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-modders-are-restoring-mechanics-pocketpair-was-forced-to-patch-out-due-to-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-patent-lawsuit">modders stepped in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC early 2024, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. The companies want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</u></a>. We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusation it used generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld: Tides of Terraria update 0.6.0 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>▼Terraria Collab!<br>・Terraria Dungeon<br>⤷ A unique dungeon featuring enemies from Terraria has been added!

<p>"Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience."</p>

<hr>
<p>Whether we'll see this game get any significant content updates in the future is unclear at this stage, but at the moment, it seems Nintendo will at least be patching any issues discovered.</p>
<p>This follows an update for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last week. Nintendo has also rolled out some Switch game updates today for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Welcome Tour on the Switch 2 yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We actually thought it was surprisingly delightful.</p>

And just this past week, Starlight Rares officially returned to the TCG, turning heads and inflating wishlists overnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, since we're halfway through 2025, I've been busy taking stock of the most valuable cards you can still pull from Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 boosters.

Dragon Master Lords</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223415"><div id="223415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Master Lords</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A 5000 attack and defense creature that can’t be targeted by card effects?

<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Ver. 13.0.4 (Released 24th June 2025)</h3>

<ul>
<li>When a Nintendo Switch 2 player and a Nintendo Switch player were matched up in online play, the match may have ended immediately if someone was using a Mii Fighter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nintendo has been branching out with movies, theme parks and last October it launched the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p>This venue features multiple historical exhibits, eight interactive experiences, a shop where you can purchase merchandise and much more. Now to add to this, the museum will be opening an art gallery.</p>
<p>The museum's official social media account has also confirmed this art gallery will be opening later this year on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong> on the second floor of the exhibition building.</p>
<p>At this location, visitors will be able to explore a "wide range of game artwork" including character illustrations and concept art. Visitors will also be able to change the date of their September ticket reservation.</p>
<p>This follows on from Nintendo Museum revealing a new exhibit for the Switch 2 back in April.</p>

            <p>
There's some bad-ish news if you've been eagerly awaiting developer Nightdive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remaster on consoles. The studio has been forced to delay the remaster's PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch release, but - good-ish news time - only by a couple of weeks as it seeks to remedy undisclosed "issues".
</p>
<p>
Nightdive announced it would be remastering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>, but it wasn't until earlier this year that the project got a new name (it's now officially known as the System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster) and a 26th June release date for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, the studio has now announced a short delay for the console versions in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nightdivestudios.bsky.social/post/3lsclg2v6o22p">statement on social media</a>, saying it has "encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles... on 26th June as originally intended." Nightdive adds that it's "currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible", but that the console release is now "targeting the first two weeks of July."

<p>
As for the PC version, that's managed to retain its 26th June release date and will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a> on 26th June as originally announced. "We'll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles," Nightdive's statement concludes.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, which follows on from 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.
</p>
<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2 released in the hazy days of 1999, taking players onboard the FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114 for another battle of wits with rogue AI SHODAN. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," Nightdive explains. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!), "It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced... and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-star-kai-cenat-really-wants-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-to-get-police-to-apologize-for-taking-his-friend%E2%80%99s-car.1227552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a meeting of the minds that is shocking only in its capacity to surprise anyone at this point, current and <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon-to-be-former</a> <a href="https://defector.com/the-most-unbelievable-bits-from-nyc-mayor-eric-adamss-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced NYC mayor</a> Eric Adams recently sat down with Kai Cenat, one of the most-watched streamers on Twitch and probably the most famous from a mainstream perspective. The latter, a Bronx native, attempted to host an in-person PS5 giveaway in 2023, which – to give you an idea of how that went – has its own Wikipedia page titled “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Union_Square_riot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Union Square riot</a>.” Now, fresh off the success of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/kai-cenat-streamer-university-what-happened.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamer University’s more contained chaos</a> and on the verge of hosting another giveaway, Cenat has some misgivings about how the NYPD treated him and his friends.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxwcFDYKoL8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> promoting the upcoming second giveaway, Cenat asked Adams how he could avoid another disastrous outcome. After the two exchanged pleasantries – with Adams granting that every day in New York is “crazy,” <a href="https://defector.com/eric-adams-the-beauty-of-new-york-is-that-there-are-terrorist-attacks-and-also-stores-that-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as is his wont</a> – Cenat, who until recently resided in Atlanta, Georgia and has since departed for another undisclosed city, explained why he got the sense that he’s no longer welcome in NYC. In short, Cenat feels like the police continued to bother him and his friends even in 2024, after the 2023 riot incident was resolved.</p><p>"[NYPD] be picking on us in a way,” Cenat told Adams, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/30/new-york-city-council-criminal-justice-reform-bills-00138644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a notoriously pro-cop mayor</a> who was once an NYPD captain himself. “In terms of a lot of times where police was doing things that they wasn't supposed to be doing. It made it feel like NYPD was a gang at one point. My friend [Roberto] Fanum [Gonzalez] got his car taken away for no reason [in 2024]."</p><p>Adams then asked if the NYPD impounded the car on the same day as the riot, to which Cenat replied that it had happened on "a whole different day." The incident Cenat described was, indeed, alarming, with an officer <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/alex-ocho/fanum-lamborghini-seized-gun-pointed-nypd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing a gun at Gonzalez</a> after last summer's Bronx Dominican Parade and handcuffing him. Police proceeded to take the car, a purple Lamborghini Urus, on the basis that, as a rep later told Complex, the vehicle lacked license plates. However, Gonzalez claimed on social media that he'd received a permit for the purposes of the parade. Additionally, pictures surfaced that seemed to depict <a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1817726076715753556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officers posing with the car</a>.</p><p>“The police would just look at us and pick us out,” Cenat told Adams. “We had trouble the whole summer [of 2024]. … I kinda feel like coming to New York, it’ll be kinda hectic in terms of, I gotta move a certain way.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response, Adams suddenly brought up one of the handful of things <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-mayor-adams-rats-99649a7a4ec4003e8ec5ca551d90ed25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s declared</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/eric-adams-nyc-trash-wheelie-bins-b2576182.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">war on</a> during his time as mayor: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mayor-eric-adams-drill-rap-1299108/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drill rap</a>.</p><p>"We've come a long way from where we were,” Adams said, never clarifying which time period he was referring to. “And what's happening now even in the Bronx, there's a lot of crews, a lot of folks getting into battles over drill music. They're disrespecting each others' community. And so, I have to find that right balance. I've got to make sure we're safe, but not with disgrace."</p><p>“Yeah,” replied Cenat, “I just feel like there were some points where, you know, it’ll be the cops taking the car and posing with it, and we’re basically getting laughed at. So, us being from New York, we felt some type of way in terms of, like, we can’t even embrace the city without something going on because of how big we are. We always have a radar every time we fly in. It was always something.”</p><p>Of the car incident, Adams then asked the question on everybody’s mind: “What did [police] take it for? Was he drag racing?”</p><p>Cenat, perhaps more prepared for Adams’ jazz-like stream-of-consciousness approach to conversation than Adams – who loves putting on a show but hates doing his homework – was for anything involving Cenat and his friends, somehow did not miss a beat: “No,” he said, “he wasn’t doing nothing.”</p><p>“OK,” Adams finally resolved, “we need to look at that.”</p><p>Cenat and Adams’ discussion of the 2023 riot and the upcoming giveaway was comparatively brief. The riot, which took place in August 2023, stemmed from a comedy of errors. Cenat and fellow mega-famous content creators like Gonzalez and Duke Dennis failed to obtain a permit for a gathering that ended up drawing thousands, who grew increasingly unruly as what was billed as PS5 giveaway collapsed under its own weight. A small handful of fans were injured, and 65 were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews/post/influencer-kai-cenat-playstation-giveaway-riot-new-york-charges-have-now-been-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a>. Police yanked Cenat out of the ensuing chaos and hit him with charges of inciting a riot and unlawful assembly, though the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/us/kai-cenat-union-square-giveaway-riot-charge-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charges were dropped</a> after Cenat paid $55,000 in restitution fees and <a href="https://people.com/twitch-star-kai-cenat-wont-face-charges-after-nyc-riot-8646247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an apology</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/domainsdomain/status/1689433483058257921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decried fans’ actions</a> shortly after shit hit the fan. This is not to say that Cenat’s moral compass was rendered infallible by the lessons he learned on that fateful day; during the aforementioned Streamer University, for example, Cenat and friends palled around with and consistently praised YouTuber and rapper DDG, who has been <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/halle-bailey-ddg-restraining-order.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of physical and emotional abuse</a> in a restraining order filed by his ex, singer and actress Halle Bailey.</p><p>During the recent conversation with Adams, Cenat, cognizant of damage done by his previous event, asked if there was a way he could more safely run it back. Adams replied by pointing to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, a boxing event so wonky that one of its main fighters, Ryan Garcia, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2025/5/3/24422840/ryan-garcia-compares-times-square-fight-experience-to-weird-fever-dream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially blamed</a> its walled-off setup for his loss, but which nonetheless <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45009726/an-look-day-boxing-took-new-york-s-square" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformed a portion of Times Square into a boxing arena</a> without descending into a riot.</p><p>"Let's look at what we just did two weeks ago,” said Adams. “We had a major, major boxing event right in the middle of Times Square. A couple hundred thousand people were there. They coordinated with the city. ... You can't still do [events] on the level you did before because now you've blown up. So now you have to do it on another level. You sit down with my team. I get the agencies involved. You map out what your plan is: ‘This is what I want to do. I want to do something to give back.’ Now you've got the city in alignment to make sure you can execute the plan."</p><p>Cenat found these terms agreeable, saying that he simply wants to “give back” to his home city after botching his first attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>He then returned to the more pressing matter at hand: “Is there a way that my friend like Fanum could probably get an apology for what happened or anything like that?”</p><p>Adams, initially confused, reiterated that he’ll look into it, and then, “if something was done wrong, [Fanum] will get an apology.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cenat then turned his attention to one last major concern:&nbsp;</p><p>"How do you get the key to the city or, like, a street sign?” he asked. “I just want to see Cenat Ave, or something like that."</p><p>“I’m looking to have Eric Ave,” Adams said, before explaining that City Council names streets, while Adams can indeed bestow the key to the city upon a worthy recipient, but only for their life’s work.</p><p>"That’ll be fire to get," said Cenat. "I just wanted to get the greenlight if I ever wanted to run back an event or run back something like [if] I can. Because, right now, I didn't know if I was able to run any event back to give back to New York because of what happened last time."</p><p>“Do it right,” Adams replied.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Cenat, “we'll do it right.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been an eventful news day for fans of adorably sinister horror series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>. Not only has the upcoming third instalment received a 10th October release date on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and  - as newly confirmed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, publisher Bandai Namco has announced an Enhanced Edition of the original game, <em>and</em> a brand-new VR instalment.
</p>
<p>
Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, which seems as good a place as any to start, promises a bit of a glow-up for developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed 2017 original. This time around, players can experience raincoat-wearing protagonist Six's strange, dark escape from the mysterious, floating Maw at 4K resolution and 60fps. There's also talk of "RTX reflections, water effects, more particles, and volumetric lighting", plus a choice between Quality and Performance modes, depending on whether you prefer to prioritise visuals or framerate.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco has given Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition an official launch date of 10th October, but it's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now for anyone that pre-orders developer Supermassive Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. Switch 2 is also getting the Enhanced Edition, but not until October.

<p>
As for that VR version, it's title Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes and... that's pretty much all we know so far. Bandai Namco is yet to confirm a developer, even the platforms it's targeting, but we do get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CvZB0nFaoE">45-second announcement trailer</a> to tide us over. "Every step echoes closer," the publisher teases, "does this tune sound familiar, little ones?" Also promising is the newly teased Little Nightmares stop-motion project, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Bandai%20Namco">looks eerily beautiful in its brisk reveal trailer</a>, although there's no hint as to when or even <em>where</em> this might eventually show up. Is it related to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightmare-before-christmas-director-bringing-little-nightmares-to-tv">Little Nightmares TV show announced back in 2017</a>? Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
So to recap: Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is out now for those that pre-order Little Nightmares 3, otherwise both games launch on 10th October. Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes, meanwhile, exists, and there's not much else to say. As to what original Little Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios is up to now, having walked away from the series after part 2, that'll be Reanimal. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-studios-reanimal-is-more-kids-in-dark-places-but-now-with-co-op">another kids-in-dark-places horror adventure</a> (but with added co-op) that's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC later this year.

            <p>
I love fishing in games. I already went over this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-fishing-is-a-horror-fishing-sim-with-only-one-goal-reel-in-the-one-thing-that-was-never-meant-to-be-found">last week with Out Fishing</a>, so I won't repeat myself much more. But I do desperately need to tell you about FISH³, or FISH³: FISHTASTIC FISHING FISHSCAPES, a very unconventional fishing game that's also an arcade time trial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a>, where the fish you catch are also your boat's engine, and you can fish while you're racing? If, like me, that entire description has you thinking "come again", then read on.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
So, here's how it works. Levels start off with you catching a fish, which involves moving your analogue sticks (controller only it seems, sorry mouse and keyboard diehards) into particular spots and hitting L2 and R2 to build up some meter to catch it. The racing part itself is akin to something like Wave Race 64, with ramps and nets to give you boosts and get in your way along the course.

<p>
What really makes the whole experience strange is that while you try to navigate a course, you can also catch more fish, because you actually have two fishing rods. This then presents a single analogue stick version of the same minigame, though this one requires more specific timing as you have to hit R2 at the same time as an arrow that's spinning around in a circle.
</p>
<p>
Now, to be clear: FISH³, in its current state, is jank as hell. I had a go at the demo and it is a sensory overload to start off with. And yet, I'm also incredibly fascinated by it. Like many arcade racers, you have target times and scores to beat, the former potentially hindered by you taking too long to reel in more fish (and other things), the latter bolstered by catching lots of fish (and other things).
</p>
<p>
There is absolutely the foundation of a special, but very odd, arcade game in there, one that I can see the biggest of sickos figuring out strats most of us will only be able to enjoy through clips on TikTok. I'm quite looking forward to seeing how it shapes up, and if you are too, then you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3641250/FISH_FISHTASTIC_FISHING_FISHSCAPES/">here</a>.

Taking into account crowds, noise, and "hostile atmosphere," EA has produced a list of the toughest stadiums in college football for visiting teams.</p><p>Part of EA's focus on improving its representation of the traditions, spirit, and overall vibes of particular campuses, this list of tough stadiums is probably not going to be too surprising to most college football fans. LSU's infamously loud and hostile Tiger Stadium, for instance, comes in at the top spot, and most of the rest of the SEC is not too far behind. Aligned with college football stereotypes and memes, you're not going to find any California schools on the list. However, college football fans are nothing if not ferociously loyal, so I'm sure this list will still find a way to spark heated debate. You can see the full list below.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week/">Little Nightmares Showcase</a> today, which the company announced was happening just last week, and it revealed a lot more than what players originally expected.</p>
<p>The expectation was that it would be a showcase focused on Little Nightmares III, with new gameplay and a release date revealed, which did happen. Bandai and Supermassive Games announced that Little Nightmares III will arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on <strong>October 10, 2025.</strong> We also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2baUKpm5k">10-minute look at gameplay</a> from a Carnevale level in the game, and the confirmation that it'll also release on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was the announcement of several new Little Nightmares projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Showcase Event" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oa85Ns7uegc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, a remaster of the original game, Little Nightmares: Enhanced Edition, was announced, though in a bit of an odd way.</p>
<p>The remaster will arrive on all platforms on October 10, same as Little Nightmares III. Players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC will be able to play the game at a 4K resolution at 60 FPS, with improved graphics, ray-traced reflections, faster loading times, revised checkpoints, and new assistance mechanics.</p>
<p>But if you want to experience the original game with all of that right now, you can, by pre-ordering a digital version of Little Nightmares III. To be clear, this enhanced edition remaster <strong>will not be out</strong> for players to buy separately for $39.99 until October. But pre-order LN3, and you'll get access to it "<em>immediately</em>," as part of your pre-order purchase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition - Comparative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6bX6GUEqFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the one hand, it's not a bad deal to get the new version of the original and the next game in the series at no extra cost when you pre-order the third game. The Enhanced Edition of the first game is available for pre-ordering any edition of LN3, from the standard to the premium collectors edition. On the other hand, the enhanced edition Tarsier did for <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-ii-tease-gamescom/">Little Nightmares II</a> was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/little-nightmares-ii-enhanced-edition-out-today-on-ps5/">free</a> for those who already owned the game, which is not the case with the enhanced edition of the first Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been mixed online, though it'll be interesting to see if fans attempt to push Bandai Namco to make this new enhanced edition available now for players who want to get it without pre-ordering the third game.</p>
<p>The next major news of the showcase was a Little Nightmares VR game called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes. Very little about this game was revealed, with Bandai only showing a short teaser trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes – Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CvZB0nFaoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The other new projects revealed were a new audio podcast, called The Sounds of Little Nightmares. A comic series, called Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere, and a novel, called Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Little Nightmares Descent to Nowhere - Comic Book Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FK30jqgA_oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All together, five Little Nightmares projects were revealed, on top of the news we already expected with the release date for Little Nightmares III. There was even a small teaser for a sixth project for the series that looked like it could potentially be a stop-motion film or TV adaptation. We can't say for sure, because the teaser was inserted partway through the showcase, and not discussed again. Hopefully, we'll hear more about it soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Magic: The Gathering Movie Screenwriters Have Been Summoned]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned.1227501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The live-action <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> movie officially has screenwriters. Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in February</a> that they would be partnering to turn the popular card game franchise into a film and TV series. They have now taken a vital step forward.</p>



<p>In an official report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/magic-the-gathering-movie-noah-gardner-aidan-fitzgerald-writers-1236441529/" rel="nofollow">Deadline</a>, two screenwriters have closed a deal to write the live-action Magic: The Gathering movie. Those screenwriters are Noah Gardner, whose work includes the blockbuster <em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</em>, and Aidan Fitzgerald, who has written several episodes of the Apple TV sci-fi drama, <em>Calls</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-bloomburrow-artwork.jpg?itok=cEMT5dzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-bloomburrow-artwork.jpg?itok=WCekML4R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both Gardner and Fitzgerald also have some experience working within established franchises. The report credits both writers on a stalled <em>Power Rangers</em> movie for Hasbro, <em>The Trench</em>, a (cancelled) <em>Aquaman</em> spin-off show for DC Entertainment, and a TV adaptation of the cult sci-fi film, <em>Trancers</em>, for Amazon.</p>

<p>Regardless of experience, Gardner and Fitzgerald have a tall order with a <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> movie. Much like another Hasbro property, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, <em>Magic</em> is a complex, sprawling setting. It comprises the main card game, comics, and several tie-in novels. All telling stories of Planeswalkers, immensely powerful interdimensional wizards facing larger than life threats across a sprawling multiverse.</p>

<p>Part of this abundance is due to the card game's popularity since its debut in 1993. Its gameplay manages to be both accessible to general audiences and infectiously exciting at a competitive level. It's game design is so malleable that crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> can happen without anything feeling out of place.</p>

<p>It is such a franchise ripe for storytelling that at one point, Netflix tried producing an animated series. It was announced in 2019 and included an eclectic cast of actors and at one point had the Russo Brothers (<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>) attached to the project. But, for one reason or another, the series was unceremoniously cancelled in 2022, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed by actor</a> Brandon Routh at a film festival.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-truly-feel-the-sparkle-of-gquuuuuux%E2%80%99s-finale-you%E2%80%99ve-gotta-do-your-anime-homework.1227495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The twelfth and final episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> <em>GQuuuuuuX</em></a> has finally landed on Prime Video, bringing the curtain down on the newest installment of a mecha franchise that’s defined anime history for nearly 50 years. When I first covered its<a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> theatrical debut</a>, my knowledge of the original series came secondhand via fandom chatter. But after completing the sidequests of watching the 1979 classic and sampling its sequel, I can say with confidence: <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s finale delivers a powerpayoff, but only if you’ve done the homework of watching the OG show that set it all in motion.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>, a joint venture between studio Sunrise and Khara, boasts writing from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno and <em>FLCL</em>’s Yoji Enokido, mech designs from Ikuto Yamashita (of Eva fame), character art from <em>Pokémon</em> designer Take, and is directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki, the visionary behind <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>, <em>FLCL</em>, and <em>Diebuster </em>fame. The premise rewrites history with a twist, where the original antagonist, Char Aznable, successfully steals protagonist Amuro Ray’s titular mech, reverse engineers its specs, and alters the course of events of the original anime’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-one-year-war-explained-gquuuuuux-2000573253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“One Year War”</a> in favor of his nation, Zeon. The moment Char is about to cinch success, he’s cast into a cosmic timeout, setting off the show’s actual plot. Enter Machu, Nyaan, and Shuji, three misfits who stumble into piloting Char’s rebanded Gundam and a mysterious prototype called the GQuuuuuuX years after his disappearance, sparking a new kind of battle where timelines bend and legacies collide.&nbsp;</p><p><em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is littered with deep-cut Easter eggs and mechanical resurrections, chief among them being the return of the <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psycho Gundam</a>, a mech I pogged out for hard as a newfound <em>Gundam </em>fan, and I can only imagine tenured fans losing their minds. There’s even a subtle but potent tip of its hat at <em>Zeta Gundam</em>, its sequel series. These inclusions never feel intrusive. Instead, they’re the kind of thoughtful fanservice that rewards attention to viewers who “know ball” and feels earned in its execution. All of it is rendered with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-06-20/cgi-veteran-hiroyasu-kobayashi-breaks-down-how-he-mech-ed-the-magic-happen-in-mobile-suit-gundam-/.224743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibrant CG and 2D animation</a> that somehow walks the line between spectacle and reverence.&nbsp;</p><p>OG players like <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Kycilia_Zabi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Kycilia</a> and tragically overlooked <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Newtype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newtypes</a> like <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Challia_Bull" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chalia Bull</a> return with real narrative weight as the surrogate parents, pitting Machu and Nyaan against each other, transforming their throuple with the milquetoast Shuji (until its finale, to my surprise) into a gripping space Shakespearean tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is a story about a multiverse collapsing in on itself. But, even more so, it’s metatextually about the generational pressure that every new Gundam series carries: measuring up to the seismic impact of the 1979 series. <em>Zeta </em>came the closest, at least in my tentative steps through the Universe Century catalog. Other shows, for all their innovations, can’t escape the long shadow cast by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundams-char-aznable-is-still-the-most-magnificent-bast-1824117617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Char Aznable</a>.</p><p>What <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> gets right, and audaciously so, is that it doesn’t step at the plate and gesture at Char’s legacy. Rather than fracturing timelines for the sake of novelty, the show remixes continuity with purpose, becoming a multiverse sequel that interrogates the past. At the center of that inquiry is the relationship that gave the original series its pulse: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-episode-11-char-amuro-2000617187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Char and Lalah Sune</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>In the original <em>Gundam</em>, Char, Lalah, and Amuro fall into a dynamic not unlike Zendaya and those two white bois in <a href="https://aftermath.site/challengers-soundtrack-reznor-ross-playstation-wipeout-2097-ape-escape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Challengers</em></a>—only with psychic powers and giant robots. Char and Amuro may be bitter rivals on the battlefield, but their connection to Lalah—and the complicated, half-spoken romantic web that ties the three together—is the emotional core that gives the series its gravity.</p><p>That’s why one of the OG show’s most gutting moments was Lalah sacrificing herself in the heat of battle by intercepting Amuro’s attack meant to kill Char. Her death, delivered by the very hands of someone who loves her, sends shockwaves through both men, triggering a guilt that echoes across the rest of the original series and well into its sequel. It’s that tragic triangle, equal parts war and destiny, and doomed by the narrative that makes the original <em>Gundam </em>sing.</p><p>In many ways, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is once again The Char Aznable Show—a distinction that, frankly, I’d happily vote for any day of the week. The series transcends basic fanservice by steering its narrative away from the man himself and toward his ever-fraught bond with Lalah Sune, reframing her not just as a symbolic Newtype linchpin, but as the emotional culmination of the story itself. Instead of keeping her in the background as a spectral presence, the finale repositions their relationship as its final, devastating denouement.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lalahs death" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ht1iZieFjf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before an alternate-timeline <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-episode-9-explained-lalah-rose-of-sharon-2000610640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lalah even appears in episode nine</a>, pilots Nyaan and Machu are drawn to a mysterious melody—the so-called “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-la-la-sound-explained-lalah-sune-char-2000596117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lalah Song</a>”— a glittering, otherworldly beacon that ignites a sparkling light show only they can see. Dubbed the “kira kira,” it becomes a psychic siren call and their shared obsession. Think of it as <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s version of <em>FLCL</em>’s “fooly cooly”—a provocative phrase folks don’t entirely know the meaning of, but get its meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s here that the series shifts gears from a playful alternative history remix into a genuine sequel that dares to ask a question that’s been circling the fandom for decades: What if Lalah didn’t die? Instead of delivering easy fanservice or nostalgic bait, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> offers a rich, surprising answer that reshapes our understanding of Char, Newtypes, and the legacy of <em>Gundam </em>itself.&nbsp;</p><p>In its final act, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> lays all its cards on the table and flips its foundation entirely. Through Machu, we meet Alt-Universe Lalah, one who has already glimpsed her tragic fate from the original timeline and comes to terms with dying to save the man she loves. However, in a twist that reconfigures the show’s stakes, we learn that the original Lalah was spirited away into Machu’s timeline, trapped in the ocean inside the ship where she died, reimagined as a living MacGuffin, “Rose of Sharon.” In the show, Lalah is once again portrayed as an object of power that the villains intend to utilize in a genocidal plan to wipe out humanity and crown Newtypes as the sole, evolved heirs of the galaxy.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Then there’s Char, who in typical fashion, has been hiding in plain sight, coming out of the shadows in a finale where all of the show’s big players butt heads. But wait, there’s more. The biggest reveal is Shiji, a character who’s essentially just …around, reveals he’s a transplant from the original <em>Gundam </em>timeline who wants to destroy Machu’s universe.&nbsp;</p><p>With each reveal, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> peels the layers back like a mecha nesting doll—but instead of losing the plot, it deepens its emotional core. In my reading of its finale, Shuji graduates from being a minor character to the spiritual echo of Amuro’s RX-78-2, haunted by the guilt of killing Lalah across infinite timelines. His mission isn’t destruction, it’s liberation. He wants to break the cycle, to free Lalah from the narrative that’s kept her locked in tragedy for half a century.&nbsp;</p><p>And somehow, the show—crafted by true mecha freaks who spent much of production arguing over which mobile suits could win in a fight—pulls off the most emotionally resonant <em>Gundam </em>anime in years. It goes full <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>, not just remixing canon but offering a sequel that dares to imagine healing where OG legends and fresh-faced pilots collide in a final battle that’s both about firepower and rewriting fate.</p><p>In the chaos, I got everything I could’ve hoped for as a born-again <em>Gundam </em>fan: Lalah gifting Char a full-blown <a href="https://gizmodo.com/revolutionary-girl-utena-is-as-lynchian-as-shojo-anime-has-ever-been-2000566141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em></a>-style magical girl transformation, a tag-team brawl where <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GFreD</a> (the show’s Eva Unit One send up) and the titular <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GGuuuuuuX</a> take on the original RX-78-2 in a handicap match so hype I found myself rooting for the legacy mech to lose. And then there’s Char getting a tender <em>Code Geass</em>-flavored finale with Lalah and queer, long overdue send off with Chalia Bull.&nbsp;</p><p>Controversially, even Amuro makes a cameo—one that hits hard in universe and feels gross in the way only anime can, by having his original voice actor Toru Furuya reprise his role following last year’s scandal where he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-toru-furuya-resigns-from-one-piece-following-affair-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to having an affair and physically abusing a fan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Distasteful as this element in the finale is, it's hard not to appreciate that <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> not only became required viewing in <em>Gundam </em>canon with gusto but also served as a gateway for newfound fans, giving the show a try and developing an interest in watching the original anime, myself included. When I spoke to director Tsurumaki about what he wanted the show’s impact to be, he said precisely that.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“<em>Gundam</em> is a series that has a long history. I watched it as a child, and it has continued on. It’s been around a long time. However, the generation of fans has really been extended. We now have many young generations who have never even watched the first <em>Gundam</em>. I think the first <em>Gundam </em>is extremely interesting, so I really want the young people to watch it because I know they will find it interesting as well,” <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsurumaki told me</a>. “I hope that the new generation could also watch the old <em>Gundam </em>as well. If that is materialized, I would be really happy.”</p><p>Long story short, it pulls off the impossible, weaving a standalone tale that lightly scaffolds enough context for newcomers while anchoring its emotional payoff in the deep waters of the original <em>Gundam </em>series. By the time its credits roll. <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> doesn’t just earn its place in <em>Gundam</em>’s towering legacy; it canonizes itself, making it required viewing for any fan of the original series and funneling newfound fans to check out the original.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares III</a> will launch on October 10, and a Switch 2 version is in the works. In addition, the publisher is giving away the remastered original game as a bonus for preordering. </p><p><span>Alongside the release date, the publisher also released a new trailer, which you can see in the embed below. The trailer shows what you can expect from the adventure game, including the characteristic tilt-shift style, dark and atmospheric environments, and cartoonishly spooky enemies.</span></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=narIoF9doAM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/narIoF9doAM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Preordering the game comes with an in-game costume set as well as Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, a remaster of the original game. The Enhanced Edition has improved graphics and performance, allowing the game to run at 4K/60fps and boasting features like ray-tracing and volumetric lighting. The remaster is unlocked as soon as you place your preorder. If you already own the original game, you'll get a free upgrade to the Enhanced Edition on October 10. </p><p>Little Nightmares III is slated for release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, the original Nintendo Switch, and now also Switch 2. On PlayStation and Xbox, the standard edition costs $40, while the Deluxe Edition will run you $60 and comes with some additional in-game content (right now, the Steam preorder is $60 for standard and $80 for Deluxe, and it is unclear if this discrepancy is intentional or not). While it'll likely be familiar to fans of the series, Little Nightmares III makes a big change with the addition of co-op--a bold choice, and one that we thought showed promise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-little-nightmares-3-the-addition-of-co-op-might-actually-make-the-game-scarier/1100-6526294/" data-ref-id="1100-6526294">we previewed the game last year</a>.</p>

The livestream shows various people calling out Mang0's behavior during the <em>Mario Kart </em>tournament, though it’s not clear that any of the organizers intervened at the time. </p><p>“I reached out to anyone who I thought might have felt uncomfortable and talked to them but also, and I already told Mang0 this, no longer inviting Mang0 to Mogul Moves events,” Ludwig said in a June 22 livestream, referencing his company that organized the tournament. “It’s a privilege to go to an event, the whole point of an event is it’s a fun thing to do, to have a good ass time and if somebody appearing jeopardizes somebody else having a good time that just can’t be a thing.”</p><p>On June 23, Marquez acknowledged the incident and said he had a problem with alcohol. “Sorry to everyone I’ve let down or hurt,” he wrote on X. “I know it just looks like I’m trying to save face but I genuinely feel so awful about it.. all I’ve done is reflect on my life and realized I’m a broken human   I will try and redeem myself over time as I always do  Gonna stop drinking immediately and get it together.”</p><p>Later that day, however, Cloud9, the team which Marquez has been representing in <em>Smash Bros.</em> tournaments for over a decade, announced it was parting ways with the esports player. “Following an internal evaluation, we have made the decision to release mang0 from Cloud9,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a statement</a></span>. “Regardless of tenure or accomplishments, the behavior demonstrated is entirely unacceptable and directly conflicts with our organization’s core values. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the Beerio Kart World Cup incident will impact Marquez’s involvement in the <em>Smash Bros.</em> competitive scene moving forward. One of the next big events, Supernova 2025, takes place in August. Currently ranked third among all <em>Melee</em> players, Marquez suggested he might be taking a break. “C9 dropping me. Probably getting banned from tourneys. Fucking shit man,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/C9Mang0/status/1937295807285461185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/C9Mang0/status/1937295807285461185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “No one to blame but myself but man.
