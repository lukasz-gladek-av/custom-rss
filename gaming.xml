            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox Interactive and developer The Chinese Room have announced yet another&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the game now not set to launch until sometime next year.</p>
<p>This news comes via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/532790/view/4248669523824762042" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on the game's Steam page</a>, in which the two studios confirm that the release window for&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been "updated to the first half of 2025". It was previously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room">slated to release some time this fall</a>.</p>
<p>Paradox says the decision to delay was "proactive", and was derived from a "commitment to delivering high-quality games to our players". I'm not sure whether the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>community <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">might have something to say about that one</a>.</p>

<p>Somewhat paradoxically, however (ahem), Paradox then says the extra development time will be used to give "more time between testing and launch, ensuring we release the game when it's ready".</p>
<p>Other adjustments will be made during the interim, however; Paradox and The Chinese Room say they'll be able to expand&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s story as a result of the extra development time, and that the game will now feature "more than twice as many endings" as the first&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines</em>, which had five.</p>
<p>More information will be released between now and <i>Bloodlines 2</i>'s eventual launch; we'll learn more about game elements like social feeding, factions, and various different characters ahead of the game's release.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has had a rather long and strange journey. The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer">first announced back in 2019</a>, with developer Hardsuit Labs then set to handle development duties on the project.</p>
<p>It was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again">times</a>&nbsp;before original narrative designer Brian Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely">removed from the project</a>, along with Hardsuit Labs, in early 2021.</p>
<p>Following that, it was revealed in September last year that the game's development would continue, now spearheaded by&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs&nbsp;</em>developer The Chinese Room. That's also when the original fall 2024 release window was announced.</p>
<p>You'll be able to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next year for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S (assuming it's not delayed again, of course). Stay tuned for more.</p>

Widely heralded as one of the best platformers ever, and one of the best games of the 2010s, this title set the gaming world on fire when it was released in 2018. <em>Celeste </em>has always been a beloved game, whether that’s for its tough-but-fair difficulty, its trans protagonist, or its approach to subject matter such as mental illness, but regardless of what exactly pulls you in, it’s difficult to deny <em>Celeste</em>’s magnetism. I suggest you let it pull you in, too. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195189,195670" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Currently, <em>Celeste </em>is on sale on Steam for all of about $5, and yes it is </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-battery-improve-games-best-pc-great-1850345890&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-battery-improve-games-best-pc-great-1850345890"><strong>perfect for your Steam Deck</strong></a></span><strong>. It’s also available on Game Pass and the PlayStation Plus catalog depending on your tier</strong>, if that’s more to your liking, but<strong> </strong>I genuinely don’t think I can emphasize enough how much of a steal this is for just five bucks. Many people who play <em>Celeste </em>cite it as a life-changing, or life-affirming, event. It is cathartic to reach the end of this game and have been able to experience Madeline’s hardships and helped her through it. <em>You </em>can have that experience for the cost of a breakfast sandwich near me. Don’t skip out on a breakfast sandwich, but maybe pick this game up <em>and </em>get a snack.<br></p><p><em>Celeste </em>takes place on the titular mountain, and follows Madeline, a young woman who has come to reach Celeste’s peak. Madeline wants to ascend the mountain to challenge herself in a bid to get over her anxiety, which frequently manifests in panic attacks and the recurring appearance of an alternate persona, Badeline, who throws events into chaos throughout the game.</p><p>As Madeline helps people on her mountain climb, such as the social media influencer Theo and the abandoned resort owner Mr. Oshiro, Badeline appears (almost like that doubtful voice in the back of your head) to knock Madeline down. In one case, Badeline actually does hurl Madeline down the mountain, and though the game seems to play it as a metaphor, it looks pretty damn real to me. How did she survive that?</p><p>The point of the game is much like <em>Dark Souls</em>, where both turn the metaphorical hurdles of life into literal demons to slay and mountains to climb. You will fail <em>a lot</em>, but by overcoming the tasks before her, Madeline hopes to prove to herself that the voice in the back of her head that chastises her isn’t always right. But in order to do so, she has to first do the toughest thing she’s ever committed to: climbing that mountain.</p><p><em>Celeste </em>is a gorgeous and grueling 2D platformer with some of the wildest movement tech I’ve ever seen. Early on, Madeline gains a dash ability that helps her navigate the mountain’s treacherous obstacles and environments, including a haunted resort and an ancient temple. This dash is the only mainstay mechanic that Madeline actually unlocks, and the rest of them are temporary power-ups that mostly appear as extensions of the themes and aesthetics of the stage they’re found in.</p><p>Some appear as bubbles that send Madeline flying and refresh her dash skill, while others look like a golden feather that transforms her into a ball of light that you must tightly control around jagged crystal walls arranged into a maze-like structure. Other times you must simply contend with the wind, and in the most exciting moments of the game, Madeline goes toe-to-toe with Badeline herself. </p><p>If it sounds epic, it’s because it is! For a game that appears bite-sized, <em>Celeste </em>packs a whole hell of a lot of challenges, including B-side (and C-side!) levels that are even more difficult than the main content, and make use of techniques that are all but hidden from players, such as the hyper dash. An epilogue that was added years later functions as the ultimate gauntlet from the developers at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/earthblade-delay-celeste-developer-maddy-thorson-1851372790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/earthblade-delay-celeste-developer-maddy-thorson-1851372790">Extremely Ok Games</a></span> and it is as tough-as-nails and simultaneously heartfelt as you might expect.<br></p><p>However, <em>Celeste </em>has also attracted a sizable following over the years, and they’re a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-the-celeste-speedrunning-community-became-queer-as-1848120383&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-celeste-speedrunning-community-became-queer-as-1848120383">super dedicated, incredibly welcoming, and very queer bunch</a></span> for whom <em>Celeste—</em>and the reveal that Madeline was trans the whole time—is a pretty significant deal. The community that’s formed around <em>Celeste </em>has gone on to speedrun the game at charity events like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sgdq-2024-summer-games-done-quick-schedule-1851573798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sgdq-2024-summer-games-done-quick-schedule-1851573798">Summer Games Done Quick</a></span>, and have even developed and run their own mods, which sometimes rival the content of the main game. You can only get those mods if you pick it up on PC, so if that sounds like something you’d like, best pick it up there right away!</p><p>Basically, getting <em>Celeste </em>on sale is a one-way ticket to one of the most devoted and sincere communities in games, while piggybacking off of one of the most challenging and satisfying platformers ever. For the incredibly low price it’s at right now, I don’t see why you shouldn’t take the plunge. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                                        <p dir="ltr">It’s been almost four years since developers Game Science dropped their first trailer for the action RPG Black Myth: Wukong. With a 13-minute runtime, the pre-alpha trailer footage caught the attention of gamers worldwide thanks to its dazzling gameplay and striking graphics powered by Unreal Engine 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Now running on the much beefier Unreal Engine 5, there's still much to unpack about this ambitious fantasy adventure. Fortunately, GameSpot is here to tell you everything you need to know about Black Myth: Wukong, from its versatile combat mechanics and upgrade systems to how it draws inspiration from Chinese folklore and classic novella.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is Black Myth: Wukong about?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The primary plot of Black Myth: Wukong remains shrouded in mystery, but we know it draws heavily from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. For those unfamiliar, Journey to the West chronicles the adventures of the monk Tang Seng and his allies, one of which is the mischievous monkey god, Sun Wukong.</p><p dir="ltr">Sun Wukong serves as the main inspiration for Black Myth’s playable protagonist, the Destined One, with many abilities, characteristics, and lore drawn directly from Wukong. Born from enchanted stone, Sun Wukong is an immensely powerful immortal being whose arrogant and brash behavior led to his imprisonment by the Buddha. Wukong is eventually released to serve as the bodyguard for Tang Seng, marking the start of his journey toward redemption.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you head off to read all 100 chapters of Journey to the West, you should know that Black Myth: Wukong takes place <strong>after</strong> the novel, so no homework is required. Game Science has also stated that Black Myth is a more mature depiction of the mythos with a central focus on Sun Wukong and the supposed truth behind his redemption.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Where is Black Myth: Wukong set?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Similarly to its plot, not much is known about Black Myth: Wukong's primary setting, other than that it is influenced by Journey to the West. The novel was set in China during the 7th century, in what was known as the 'Western Regions,' primarily comprising Central Asia and India.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's unclear how much of Journey to the West's settings will be revisited, some areas, such as 'Black Wind Mountain,' are present. Enemies inspired by these areas will also appear, such as a hulking black bear based on the 'Black Wind Demon' from Journey to the West.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside characters and settings inspired by the novel, we can expect to see a few original creations from Game Science, as well as depictions based on other stories from Chinese folklore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350688-2318169151-ss_86.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350688-2318169151-ss_86.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350688"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350688-2318169151-ss_86.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Exploration in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Despite Black Myth: Wukong's beautifully stylized world and environment, it is not an open-world game, instead following a more linear level design. However, each area in Black Myth is still teeming with hidden gear, upgrades, and optional bosses to discover.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Combat in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">At its core, Black Myth: Wukong is about speed, precision, and reading your opponents. As you journey across realms as the Destined One, your primary means of combat is the Ruyi Jingu Bang--Wukong's iconic, size-altering enchanted staff.</p><p dir="ltr">The staff can be used in at least three stances: Smash, Pillar, and Thrust, each offering a distinct playstyle. The default Smash stance focuses on chaining combos through light and heavy attacks. The Pillar stance allows the Destined One to create a perch for avoiding ground-based attacks, which can then be brought down on enemies for a devastating blow. Alternatively, you can swing around the planted staff - like the mischievous monkey you are - delivering kicks to all enemies surrounding you. Lastly, the Thrust stance delivers quick, powerful strikes that can also be used at long range.</p><p dir="ltr">Mastering each stance is crucial for surviving Black Myth's intense combat, but you won't get far without getting to grips with its versatile dodge mechanic. Outside of deflecting projectiles and using special abilities, there is no block function in Black Myth, so dodging is your primary form of defense. There’s more strategy to combat than just timing, however. With a multitude of combat styles, special attacks, and transformations, you’ll need to use all the tools on your mystical toolbelt to devise the right strategy for each encounter.</p><p dir="ltr">Dodging and attacking drains stamina so choose your moments wisely. Perfectly timed dodges increase your focus meter, granting access to even more powerful attacks and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">As you progress through Wukong’s rich mythological world, you will come face to face with a vast array of fearsome foes. Journeying through dense forests and fighting atop crumpled temples, players can expect to have their skills tested throughout this Buddhist folklore-inspired epic. From early encounters with blade-wielding anthropomorphic wolves to reflex-testing showdowns with building-sized, venomous toads, each new area requires a cunning combination of stances and a keen eye for reading enemy attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">As you trade blows with leaping lizards or fell katana-wielding tigers, every new beast you battle feels pleasingly unique, their designs and attacks drawing from a rich well of Eastern mythology. In true genre form, taking the time to defeat each opponent reaps great rewards, allowing players to unlock new skills and techniques for their chosen combat stance.</p><p dir="ltr">Nowhere is this truer than with Wukong’s bosses. As you roam across this awe-inspiring land, the Destined One will face increasingly horrifying creatures. Each boss will test your skill, serving as the final exam for everything that you have learned battling the flora and fauna that came before. While many of these bosses are essential to progressing through the story, each region you explore will feature an array of optional mini-bosses, defeating them netting you great rewards. From ancient wolf gods to terrifying demonic infants, this story will pit you against a wealth of unforgettable gods, each more fearsome than the last. Luckily for players, the Destined One has a few extra tricks up his sleeve.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Special abilities in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the Ruyi Jingu Bang staff, the Destined One also has access to an array of magical and physical abilities, many of which appear to be based on Sun Wukong's 72 heavenly powers. These abilities include freezing enemies in place, creating defensive barriers, shapeshifting, and summoning an army of duplicates to aid you in battle. A fearsome fire glaive is an early highlight, allowing players to temporarily transform into a state that imbues their staff with deadly flame attacks, proving incredibly useful for defeating enemies who are weak to burning.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability to shapeshift is one of the most powerful skills in Black Myth and offers many unique abilities. One transformation takes on the appearance of an imposing feline creature that delivers devastating blows, while another turns you into a strange creature made of stone that is impervious to most attacks. Some transformations include previously defeated enemies and bosses, though it's unclear if this is the only way to unlock new forms.</p><p dir="ltr">Certain transformations have uses outside of combat as well. At certain points in the story, you’ll be turned into a small bird or flying insect to progress the story. At one point early on, for instance, you’re turned into a cicada for the chance to survey a new area and prepare for what lies ahead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350689-9433826540-ss_96.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350689" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350689-9433826540-ss_96.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350689"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350689-9433826540-ss_96.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Upgrades and crafting in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Black Myth: Wukong may borrow some mechanics from soulslike and character-action titles, but it is fundamentally an action RPG. Better armor, weapons, and gear can be found hidden throughout levels and can be crafted with the correct materials. Wearing full armor sets also provides bonus buffs such as increasing the amount of focus you earn from dodging.</p><p dir="ltr">For upgrading abilities, Black Myth: Wukong features three separate skill trees: one for magic abilities, one for staff abilities (in which there are three more trees - one for each combat stance), and one for character-specific abilities, such as increasing your maximum health. Skill trees can be progressed in whatever order best suits your playstyle by spending Sparks. Sparks are level-up points you can obtain through gaining experience (usually from hitting things real good) and through meditation points that you’ll find dotted around the world. Falling in battle causes you to lose a portion of your unbanked experience, but Black Myth: Wukong is a little more lenient than other titles and only penalizes you with a small amount of XP per death.</p><p dir="ltr">You’ll also be collecting Will, which can be used to purchase items and upgrade equipment, so keep an eye out for floating green lights and smash all the pots you see!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Who developed Black Myth: Wukong?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Game Science is a Hangzhou-based studio known for developing the multiplayer RTS, Art of War: Red Tides. Black Myth: Wukong is Game Science’s first triple-A game and marks their biggest undertaking to date. Previously, Game Science’s core founders worked at Tencent Games on the MMORPG Asura.</p><p dir="ltr">With the first trailer for Black Myth: Wukong garnering well over 10 million views on YouTube and over 10 million on the Chinese video site Bilibili, all eyes are on this ambitious studio and its grander plans for creating a ‘Black Myth’ gaming universe.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When is Black Myth: Wukong out?</strong></p><p>Black Myth: Wukong reaches its long-awaited release on August 20th for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

It is our first commercial game as a studio, even though most of us have worked together to make mobile games for different companies, and participated in many game jams together. We knew a bunch of things about making games, but we had to learn together how to make a game this big, this ambitious, and this pretty.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> started out as a game jam project for the 45th edition of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The Jam's theme of "Start with nothing" inspired us to make a game about a swordless samurai. As a team we had participated in many game jams together, and we were used to making gameplay and visual decisions to make our work easier in the limited development time given to us for events like these.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of these decisions was to make the character have the same action for dodge and parry, to save on animation and coding time. Another such decision was to have a 1-bit-</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ish</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> aesthetic, with only black, white, and red on the screen, so that the artists could produce environments and animations quickly.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This 3-color palette style is very different from what we ended up with in the game. Characters in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> still keep the black-white-red palette for the most part, but the scenery has completely changed. I think the term "hi-bit," which I've seen a few times to refer to modern pixel art games, really encapsulates what we went for with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It has an extreme palette limitation, with a maximum of 12 colors on the screen at once. Still, the dynamics of the visuals make it instantly noticeable that this is a modern game with fancy effects going on.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> did we get from one to the other? When we finished the game jam version, we were by no means dissatisfied with its visual style. We had a positive reception to the game from the community, and one of the most recurring feedbacks we got was that the visuals were very striking. I think that the reason was that, as with many things in this game, we, at some point, developed a vision of what we wanted, and sort of decided that we couldn't do without it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After Ludum Dare, we were all on board with turning that small game jam prototype into a full 5-ish hours-long game (it ended up with nearly twice that playtime, though). We knew that to turn it into a full game, we had to flesh out all areas: more enemies, a deeper story, and improved visuals. We were really happy with how the game looked and thought of just having more detailed scenery and animations, maybe using some extra "accent" colors, like the pink in a sakura tree (which we had made for an expanded version after the game jam).</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But then I saw </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/">Return of the Obra Dinn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and everything changed. I knew we </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>had</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to do something like that. Our game had a great, more traditionally retro visual style, but we wanted to elevate it somehow. That striking style of two-color shading instantly felt like the correct inspiration to me. Luckily, the creator of Obra Dinn, Lucas Pope, even had some blog posts on how he made the art style work, so I studied them quite a bit.</span></p><p>Image via Lucas Pope.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The style of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Return of the Obra Dinn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses a technique called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dithering </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">quite a lot, where you create the illusion of multiple shades between two colors by alternating between them via a pattern. Instead of transitioning from a light color to a dark color via the intermediate color, you use less and less of the light color and more of the darker one. There are many patterns you can use for dithering. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Obra Dinn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses a more noisy pattern that makes it feel more natural, but we ended up using a classic Bayer pattern, which makes it very "pixel-y."</span></p><p>Here’s what a gradient looks like when rendered in Bloodless. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the team liked this idea of exploring dithered lights, so they agreed to have me work on this evolution of our art style. We didn't know exactly what we would do, so it was a very exploratory process. I also had very little experience writing shaders, especially 2D shaders. I had to juggle trying to figure out what we wanted to do, how to do it, and if it was even possible. The first thing I could do was just use lighting to alternate between black and white pixels. It was a really cool effect and gave us more certainty that this was a good direction.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The really tricky thing was where to go </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>after</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that. Since I was championing this, and it was gated by my skills and the limitations of Unity's 2D Renderer and lighting system, I tried making some prototypes, exploring what I thought would be interesting ways to push the tools we had from Unity's lighting system. I remember a tech demo I made where I tried using the three color channels to make different colors of light and blend them. A lot of those ended up looking pretty bad, and the whole endeavor was driving me crazy.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was when we took a step back and went back into looking for references. One particularly cool indie game that our art director showed us that used some of the same dithering techniques we were trying out was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hell is Other Demons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It had a 4-color palette and used lighting to blend between those colors with dithering on the borders. Our game was previously defined by just being black and white (with a bit of red), so each color added had to be thoroughly discussed. I started experimenting with the lighting having a Game Boy Color-esque limited palette, and the results were really promising.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We iterated on this style while other aspects of the game were also being improved. The first region of the game was a forest on the outskirts of the Old City, where a lot of the story happens. We went back and forth on the color palette, shader parameters, and features to decide things like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dither-y </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the shading would be, how much each light would illuminate, and how the lighting effect would vary from object to object. Even quite later on in the project, we would still keep adjusting how the palettes worked, how the texture assets themselves were shaded, and how the parameters of the light sources were set up to get everything </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>right</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p>An early illuminated scene. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So the system we ended up with was: we had the scenery, which was illuminated with a palette of seven colors that served as the shades from lighter to darker in environment objects, plus five "accent" colors that were not affected by lighting. Characters were always flat black and white, with some details using the accent colors, while environment objects had materials that used a subset of the seven colors and had different lighting parameters. Each environment object has up to five colors from the seven, with two of them usually being black and white, with this limitation being very useful for building a visual hierarchy.</span></p><p>Here’s what a palette looks like in the game assets. This is the one for the bamboo forest. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had fully embraced lighting as a core aspect of the game's visuals, light sources became very important, so we started adding more of them: braziers, lamps, light beams from the sky, and fireflies. Our game started feeling oddly… realistic? Not exactly realistic, but grounded in a way. We started experimenting with normal maps and shading in the assets themselves to add more and more to this vibe, and anything that didn't quite match that felt odd. Preserving this grounded feeling proved to be quite a challenge as we added the next big aspect of the game's visual style: water.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having water in the game was not only important to add variety to the scenery but also central to the worldbuilding of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Bakugawa, the place where the game is set, is an island, and the central deity that its people worship is a god of rivers, so we had to have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>rivers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I remember trying to delay doing this quite a bit back then because I was just very scared of it, and in the end, making the water effects of this game was almost as difficult as building that first version of the lighting style and probably even more stressful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It took a little more than a month from starting it to when we got the first version of the water and reflections we were happy with. It was a very stressful period and full of frustration, partly because this kind of stuff is generally hard to achieve and was unfamiliar to me, and also because there were a lot of specific aspects of our game that made it even harder.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p>It took one month to get from the first to the second image. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oftentimes, reflections in 2D top-down games are done by simply having an upside-down copy of the sprite rendered only where there is water. That would not be good enough for our game for a bunch of reasons, the most important being the lighting. Because the lighting was so crucial to how every single object looked in our game, having an object be lit differently on the top than the bottom felt weird, so we had to have the same sprite render on the original and the reflection in different passes and use the lighting information from the original on the bottom one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were a lot of little details like this that took some time to get right with the water: objects in the water needed to be submerged, and we had water of different depths, so that also had to be taken into consideration. The fireflies go up and down, so they should get closer and further from their reflections during this animation. We had to power through all of this stuff because if anything were out of place or missing, it would stick out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, we managed to do everything we deemed necessary, and I'd say it paid off because the water effects are an integral part of the visuals now (and one of the things I'm personally the most proud of in the game).</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these visual systems ended up requiring a lot of internal tools. Because the reflections were quite expensive, we wanted to disable them for objects that weren't near water. So we made tools to detect the water near the objects and change the object material, saving some precious draw calls to make our game run smoothly. One of the things I'd probably do differently in this project was to test out the performance of all these features earlier. For example, the normal maps in Unity's 2D pipeline are very costly, and we might have been able to avoid using them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an experience that included a lot of iterations, learning, and pushing ourselves to do new things. We pushed ourselves a lot because we knew the game we wanted to make, and we would not be satisfied until we saw it meet the level of quality we knew it deserved. Everyone brought their best to it, and I couldn't be more proud of what we, as a team, made. The combat, worldbuilding, sound design, level layouts, and everything else were made with loads of care and a little bit of obsession, and I hope it comes across to anyone who plays our game.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224391/mecha-break-nvidia-ai-npcs-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia ACE, the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23740908/nvidia-ace-demo-voice-ai-npc-game-characters">AI-powered system</a> for giving voices and conversation skills to in-game characters, is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fmecha-break-nvidia-ace-nims-rtx-pc-laptop-games-apps%2F">set to debut</a> in <a href="https://www.mechabreak.com/index/en/#/"><em>Mecha Break</em></a>, a new multiplayer mech battle game coming to PC, Xbox X / S, and PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p><p>In<em> Mecha Break,</em> players can choose from a variety of mechs across categories like assault, melee, and sniper for online matches where they’ll fight both on the ground and in the air. It looks similar to something like the <em>Armored Core</em> series, just without a single-player mode. </p><p>Nvidia writes that players will be able to “interact via natural language with game characters” and that the characters can “see” and identify you or objects around you through your webcam, using GPT-4o. It’ll also use a combination of on-device Nvidia models and cloud-based AI to generate NPCs’ voices. </p><p>In the demonstration above, the player asked an in-game character for details about their mission and mechs, then changed their mech’s paint job by talking to it. The AI NPC’s responses were flatly delivered and bland. Maybe that’s fine when NPCs are just glorified in-game wikis.</p><p>But it might not be ideal for much beyond that. When <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">demoed Nvidia ACE</a> in January, he pointed out that the characters “didn’t feel like real people,” the dialog wasn’t particularly inspiring, and that there were frequent delays before NPCs replied. <em>Mecha Break</em> doesn’t look like it’s any better so far, but we’ll see where things stand when it releases next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Backyard Sports, the iconic video game series known for making kid-friendly sports games, <a href="https://backyardsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is back</a>.</p><p>In a press release, Playground Productions, the company currently holding the rights to the Backyard Sports IP, confirmed it was reviving the series, noting that the franchise is "slated to return in the coming months." Playground Productions also provided the first teaser trailer for Backyard Sports, featuring memorable characters like Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan.</p><p>You can check out the first trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Beyond the confirmation of new Backyard Sports video games, Playground Productions said the series' return will expand its reach to multiple verticals beyond video games, such as film, TV, and merchandise. Playground Productions explained that the revival of Backyard Sports will use "cutting-edge technology and esteemed character IP" to aim to create stories and experiences that will resonate with those who grew up with the series along with the current generation of youth.</p><p>"We're incredibly excited to reintroduce Backyard Sports to a new generation of players," Playground Productions CEO Chris Waters wrote in the press release.

Instead, he plans to make video games of his own, although has yet to announce any concrete plans.</p><p>Amid this, Modern Warfare Remastered’s recent Steam reviews now read “Mostly Negative,” with many recent comments from players calling for Activision to reverse its cease and desist request.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The game also garnered headlines in recent days thanks to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guidelines-ask-content-creators-not-to-discuss-feminist-propaganda-covid-and-more/1100-6525951/">highly unusual</a> content guidelines given to streamers covering the game, telling them not to discuss COVID or "feminist propaganda" when covering the game.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, critic Richard Wakeling praised the game's impressive visuals and boss fights. "Black Myth: Wukong is an uneven game where the highlights often outnumber the lowlights," he wrote. "Its triumphant boss battles and fast-paced combat make up for the stale moments in between, where bland level design and a scarcity of enemies will have you clamoring for the next face-off with a deadly Yaoguai. I appreciate that it's not just another souls-like in what is now a crowded genre, and the choice to go for a boss gauntlet is unexpected and, honestly, quite refreshing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-update-520<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Creative Assembly have released a new&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's bringing big changes to Dwarfs, Chaos, greenskins, and more besides.</p>
<p>This update follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510">June's Patch 5.1.0</a>, which brought a new Legendary Hero with it, and while there's nothing quite that epic to enjoy this time around, you'll likely appreciate some of the changes, especially if you're a fan of Chaos cults (and who isn't?).</p>
<p>First up, the Dwarfs have received a brand new campaign feature in the form of the Deeps, which allows Dwarfs to expand beneath their Karaks once the Great Gate building has been built. Creative Assembly says this feature is intended to address criticisms that Dwarfs' playstyles are "overly expansionist and aggressive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-dwarfs-deeps.jpg?itok=-ariAOF4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-dwarfs-deeps.jpg?itok=1_yyAVnu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Dwarfs have new features to look forward to in&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Chaos Cults have also been reworked; Cultist agents can now create Cults, and Cults will produce corruption themselves instead of spreading through corruption.</p>
<p>Each Chaos God has an expanded building tree to look forward to, and Cults have had their buildings and effects revamped as well, creating what Creative Assembly calls "unique and interesting gameplay effects".</p>
<p>Across the whole of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>'s campaign, a new Unusual Locations feature has been introduced, which will allow you to "stumble across 20 new unusual locations" that provide "unique and interesting effects". More to the point, however, they also serve as nods for those who know their&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>
<p>If you're a Grand Cathay player, you may also appreciate the new Ivory Road update, which changes the way caravans work; Cathay can dispatch multiple caravans, and caravans will also gain a unit based on where they complete their journey.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-unusual-locations.jpg?itok=rNdl97lB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-update-5.2.0-unusual-locations.jpg?itok=iCod-VUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>'s new Unusual Locations should give you a chance to indulge in some&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>lore.</figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty more changes besides these, including new greenskin units, new UI improvements, and much more.

            <p>As much as I’m a sucker for the grimmest and darkest of grimdark fantasy settings, the try-hardness of it all can get a bit grating at times. You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heroes-of-the-seven-islands">Heroes Of The Seven Islands</a> feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s fun, it’s colorful, and I can bet it took an absolutely bastard-long time to make, despite a somewhat blasé tone towards its own existence. It’s by Rap2h, who's behind free interactive fiction thingy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2271590/The_Secret_of_Darkwoods/">The Secret of Darkwoods</a>, which 99 people are very positive about. That’s not a big number, but it is nice one. Here’s a trailer for Heroes Of The Seven Islands:</p>

<p>It does look to me, so far at least, like the sort of project that’s got me more interested in discovering the hand-drawn interpretations of various fantasy weirdos than actually fighting them. Still, I’m intrigued by the ‘reputation’ system you can spot in the top right corner of the screen, and how this ends up affecting how people treat your rat druids and bird knights. Here’s the story setup, as told by reputable bard Steam:</p>
<blockquote><p>FURAX THE INDESTRUCTIBLE, fleshless carcass and soulless body, has arrived through an inter-dimensional rift in the colorful, carefree world of Émeyralia, to spread SADNESS and DESPAIR. Nothing seems to be able to stop him: his influence grows daily, many disciples join him and NIGHTMARE CREATURES appear on every continent.</p>
<p>According to the prophecy, only THE ORACLE could defeat him, but he retired centuries ago. To find him, the 7 keys held by the 7 rulers of the 7 islands of the Emerald Archipelago must be gathered. FOUR HEROES, the bravest of the brave, are chosen for this quest. The future of Emeyralia is in their hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game promises hundreds of hand-drawn animations, which is wild, because my hand cramps up if I try to draw a single cat. I had to fill in a form to adopt my actual cat last week, and I think my wrist might still be broken. The combat is “Turn based yet fast”, there’s main and side quests, and it's all scored by “Dungeon Synth Artists”, although no word on the arists in question. You can find the Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010290/Heroes_of_the_Seven_Islands/">here</a>, and it’s due out Q1 next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Are you ready to head to the backyard? <a href="https://backyardsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Playground Productions</a> has officially announced the return of the Backyard Sports franchise for the first time in a decade.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a trailer after days of teases on social media.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Backyard-Sports-Official-Reveal-Trailer.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The first trailer, as you can see above, confirms the return of Backyard Baseball as one of the first titles. It’s also expected that sports like Football, Basketball, and others will get the Backyard Sports treatment.</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly excited to reintroduce&nbsp;<em>Backyard Sports</em>&nbsp;to a new generation of players,” Chris Waters, Playground Productions’ chief product officer, said via Press Release. </p>



<p>“We’re taking great care to preserve the look and feel that made the original games so special while updating them with modern features and gameplay that today’s audience expects. I can’t wait for fans to see what we’re building on the Playground.”</p>



<p>“Backyard Sports&nbsp;is more than just a game; it’s a cherished part of childhood for millions of people,” Playground Productions founder and CEO Lindsay Barnett said.</p>



<p>The series began in 1997 with the original Backyard Baseball. From there, the franchise broke out into other sports like Football, Hockey, Soccer, and Basketball. The last releases game in the form of mobile games in 2015.</p>



<p>More information on the return of Backyard Sports games will be announced “in the coming months”.</p>

That was impressive enough for Game Science, a studio founded by ex-Tencent staff who in the past had primarily worked on mobile games. But <em>Black Myth</em> has also topped every other Steam online sensation of the last few years, including <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Palworld</em>, as well as Valve’s own multiplayer hits <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p>That overwhelming day-one audience appears to be mostly overseas so far, with Simon Carless of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Discover</em> newsletter</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimating</a></span> almost 90 percent of <em>Black Myth</em>’s current players on Steam are from China, followed by 3 percent from the U.S. and 1 percent from Japan. “Probably, China accounts for 80+% of players where with a large game with localization in the region will account for maybe 25-40%m” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1825880703596429525&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1825880703596429525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Michael Douise, head of publishing at <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>maker Larian Studios. “It’s a testament what the region can do to shatter numbers when properly mobilized both regionally and internationally in one big launch.”</p><h2 id="h134236"><a id=""></a>Is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Game Pass?</h2><p>We also still don’t know the breakdown of player numbers on PlayStation 5, where <em>Black Myth</em> is a temporary console exclusive after the Xbox version was delayed. The Microsoft miss echoes last year’s giant <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> launch where a version wasn’t ready for the Game Pass platform until December. Why the wait this time? “We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X/S version to meet our quality standards, so it won’t release simultaneously with the other platforms,” Game Science <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote earlier this year</a></span>. “We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p><p>Some players speculated that was due to a surprise exclusivity deal with Sony, but it seems like the Xbox version, which has to have feature parity on both Xbox Series X and the weaker S, just wasn’t ready. “We’re excited for the launch of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” a Microsoft spokesperson told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windows Central</em></a></span> in June. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</p><p>Given the blockbuster launch thus far, it seems unlikely <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> will be a surprise Game Pass release once it finally hits Xbox unless Microsoft is willing to shell out some series money.

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/20/sonic-x-shadow-generations-interview-shadow-the-hedgehogs-new-doom-powers-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, PlayStation shared an interview revealing fresh details on Shadow’s Doom Powers coming to Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>



<p>During the interview, Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka said “the Doom Powers play an essential role in Shadow’s journey and development.” They emphasized its flexibility, giving Shadow “new ways to attack enemies and traverse the world” with platforming and more. </p>



<p>Iizuka also mentioned that “the Doom Powers draw energy from Black Doom, so that was taken into consideration in the design of all the Doom Powers.” Earlier this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-new-images-tease-black-doom-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some new images</a> revealed the modern render of the iconic villain Black Doom. </p>



<p>The blog accompanied a new trailer today, which showcases Shadow’s anticipated Doom Powers in action.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer breaks down key abilities including Doom Spears and Doom Blast, which offer new ways for players to attack with Shadow. </p>



<p>Doom Morph, Doom Wing, and Doom Surf are all traversal techniques, allowing shadow to interact with environments, fly, and cross water with ease.</p>



<p>In July 2024, Takashi Iizuka also mentioned a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rpg-sega-takashi-iizuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential Sonic RPG</a>. Though he said such a project is “just a dream right now,” they appeared to express serious interest.</p>



<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations launches on October 25, 2024. It will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and current or last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is taking the world by storm on launch day, beating out records left and right to become one of the most-played games on Steam on day one. It’s honestly impressive, and after playing the game for hours, I fully understand why. It’s phenomenal but certainly more challenging than many were led to believe. Here’s what you need to know before starting Black Myth: Wukong!</p>



<h2 id="h-tips-before-starting-black-myth-wukong">Tips Before Starting Black Myth: Wukong</h2>



<p>We’ve compiled a handful of tips, and it’s sure to grow as I dive into the game more today, that should help you gain a foothold in Black Myth: Wukong. Here’s how to get the best start and beat your opponents as The Destined One!</p>



<h2 id="h-harvest-everything">Harvest Everything!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s start with one of the most essential tips I can offer new players: harvest everything you see. As you explore each zone, you’ll stumble upon countless harvestable resources. These vary in type. You’ll acquire Aged Ginseng, Purple Lingzhi, Gentian, Jade Lotus, and many others. They’re all necessary to craft medicine, which can heal you, remove various effects, such as poison or fire damage, boost your damage output, and even increase your damage resistance.</p>



<p>Trust me when I tell you that you’ll want a few medicinal items on hand to defeat the game’s many bosses!</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-world-around-you">Explore the World Around You</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong isn’t an open-world game but is still relatively large. Every zone I’ve explored so far includes numerous pathways, multiple optional bosses, and countless weak and powerful enemies that provide you with Will upon besting them in combat. </p>



<p>Like in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-steam-deck-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>, there’s no shame in farming regular mobs before tackling a boss. You can quickly gain a level or two before each boss fight by clearing the entire zone. If you want to farm, let the last enemy kill you and repeat the process. </p>



<p>But more importantly, you’ll find secret routes, treasure chests, harvestable resources, and optional secret bosses that reward you with items and Will necessary to push further into the story.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-fear-dying">Don’t Fear Dying</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it certainly borrows from the Soulslike genre, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t technically a Soulslike. It’s still challenging, and there are still many bosses to challenge; there’s no penalty for dying. Should you perish in combat, you’ll respawn at the last Shrine you visited and then go about your day. </p>



<p>That’s right; when you die in Black Myth: Wukong, you don’t drop your Will. You keep everything in your inventory, and the only downside is now you must traverse the zone once more and clear its enemies out of your way. You lose time and nothing else.</p>



<h2 id="h-visit-shrines-often">Visit Shrines Often</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Every Shrine you encounter is a checkpoint. Should you die in combat, you’ll respawn at the last Shrine. But there’s more to these offering points than meets the eye. Every Shrine allows you to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rest</strong>: Replenish your resources, including health and stamina, but all regular enemies respawn (not bosses!).</li>



<li><strong>Travel</strong>: You can travel fast from one Shrine to another, which makes farming Will easier.</li>



<li><strong>Self</strong>–<strong>Advance</strong>: You can choose which spells you’ll wield and respec your skill points.</li>



<li><strong>Craft</strong>: Create weapons and armor using materials you’ve gathered in the world.</li>



<li><strong>Brew</strong>: Craft drinks to aid you in combat.</li>



<li><strong>Store</strong>: Purchase and sell items.</li>



<li><strong>Make Medicines</strong>: Create consumable medicinal items to aid you in combat.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, don’t be afraid to buy items from the Store. It’s a helpful way to gain aid items that allow you to deal additional damage or take more damage from enemies. But also, the Store will periodically refresh with new items, so check back frequently!</p>







<h2 id="h-defeat-bosses-to-gain-spirits">Defeat Bosses to Gain Spirits</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you stumble upon bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, you have a choice. Unless they’re a story boss, you can walk away and find a different path to your objective or fight. It’s up to you. But I recommend you fight every boss you can, as they’ll reward you with Will, occasionally valuable items, and Spirits. You want to acquire as many Spirits in Black Myth: Wukong as possible.</p>



<p>As you unlock Spirits, you’ll unlock that boss’ attack. It expands your arsenal of combat moves, allowing you to mix up playstyles and deal additional damage to enemies. But more importantly, Spirits grant you passive buffs that alter crucial elements of combat. For instance, some Spirits work like a Bloodied build in Fallout 76, allowing you to deal more damage when at low health.</p>



<p>But if you find that you cannot defeat a boss, you can use the game’s fast travel system to return to an area at any point in the game to challenge them once you’re stronger!</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-your-armor-wisely">Consider Your Armor Wisely</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>To aid you in combat, you will inevitably unlock the ability to craft armor. When you visit a Shrine, you’ll see the new choice in the menu, and by now, you should have the necessary resources to craft most of the first armor set: Pilgrim’s.</p>



<p>This is one of the key reasons why you should harvest everything! Every armor set in the game offers a unique buff to your stats and abilities. Take the Pilgrim’s set, for example. When you equip two pieces, your Sprint speed moderately increases. With four pieces equipped, as you Sprint, you gain a damage buff that stacks up to 10 times. It’s incredibly potent when used appropriately.</p>



<p>But as you progress through the game, you will unlock additional armor sets that buff damage, increase defense, and other boons that affect your play style. Find the right set for you, and the rest of the game becomes relatively easier!</p>

<p>The new update, however, has ushered in a rush of new and returning players, upping its concurrent peak to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/594650/charts/?__cf_chl_tk=FZ5GXDFLVTgu85Z4FUkRu4.ml_HRXNG1m_bHXKsmOf0-1724142110-0.0.1.1-8020">60,124 players</a>.</p>
<p>You'd think this would be good news for the player base, but that aforementioned UI update has actually seen the game's hitherto "mostly positive" Steam review score tumble to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>"Hunt 1896 is an unbearable garbage. All the bugs in game make in-game experience completely unsatisfying," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080789007/recommended/594650/">said</a> one unhappy player who has clocked up over 500 playing it.</p>
<p>"Also the new UI... whoever made it should be deprived from ever developing video games. I've played 500+ hours and enjoyed this game, but after such a spit into players' faces, Crytek deserves only bad reviews."</p>
<p>"Y'all chill out about the UI," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023192091/recommended/594650/">suggested</a> one less aggravated player. "New players are coming to the game [right now], and the first thing they're seeing is 'Mostly Negative' reviews. The dev's gon' fix it."</p>
<p>"The bad steam reviews are coming from people who don't realise the UI was always a slog since 2019," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/marcosvolta/recommended/594650/">added</a> another.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-hunt-showdown-1896-pops-up-on-the-esrb-website">Hunt: Showdown 1896 popped up on the ESRB website last month</a>, although, at the time, we weren't sure if this was a full sequel or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">eagerly-anticipated update</a> big enough to necessitate a new rating. Turns out it was the latter.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
