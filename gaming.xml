" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are more amazing games coming out every week than ever before. Some of them instantly become breakout hits. Others slowly accrue cult status over months and years. Some are finally released and quickly overlooked, cherished by a small coterie of early players and completely unknown to everyone else who might have fallen in love with them. Every year we try to give a handful of the most underappreciated games a quick plug in hopes that others will give them a much-deserved first or second look. Here are some of our favorite hidden gems from 2024.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168"><em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em></a></span><em> </em>is for <em>Simpsons: Hit and Run</em> sickos. You’re a kid who lies to his family to get a job with a taxi company completing jobs and collecting junk to upgrade your ride. It’s colorful, funny, and has the responsive-feeling controls to match its quirky world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p><em>Crypt Custodian</em> is a top-down Metroidvania with <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>vibes. You play a cat who’s the janitor of the afterlife. Lots of platforming and puzzling ensues. The art direction is top-notch, the music is calming, and the world is masterfully crafted for an alluring but not frustrating time exploring a gorgeous world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>If you want something that looks like <em>Pentiment</em> but plays like a <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>-style 2D tactics game, look no farther <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..">than <em>Inkulinati</em></a></span>. The game takes place inside a medieval manuscript and features plenty of challenging strategic scenarios and goofy animal humor. It came out of Early Access this year and offers a deep and engaging package despite the small scale and straightforward ideas. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Starstruck: Hands of Time</em> feels like the sort of bonkers genre mashup we don’t really get anymore. A time-traveling rhythm game, there’s elements of <em>Katamari</em> and <em>Guitar Hero </em>with an original art style borrowing from 3D sculpture and 2D collage. It doesn’t completely deliver on its ambitions, but swings for the fences like anything can happen. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A twin-stick shooter meets <em>Zelda </em>dungeoneering sounds like putting peanut butter on pickles and tastes just as good. <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is like playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> as Star Fox. You explore a top-down map to unlock new paths and upgrades and take on bosses with punchy shooting that controls like a classic arcade game. It’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765">just damned brilliant</a></span>.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>I was turned onto Mask Quest by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em>’s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell</a></span>. It’s a precision platformer about controlling your breath while navigating a modern city and all of its contemporary socio-political hazards. It’s short, thoughtful, and brutal. “The cleverness of the game’s level design is as double-edged as the humor,” writes Evans-Thirlwell. ”It gracefully weaponizes and politicizes the casual sadism of any game that defines itself as a series of goals and punishments.” — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>What if<em> Hotline Miami </em>was more like <em>Silent Hill</em>? Enter <em>Conscript</em>, a WWI top-down horror stealth game about smashing enemy soldiers’ heads in while trying to escape the trenches. It’s slow, plodding, and at times tortuous. It’s all beautifully and hauntingly presented. It lures you into a sense of tedious exhaustion and then—BANG—you’re dead. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A cozy sandbox builder where you make shops and homes by the water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing <em>Summerhouse</em></a></span> is like inhabiting a postcard from a long-lost friend. It’s reminiscent of what <em>Kingdom</em> did for tower defense strategy games, imposing 2D pixel art constraints to bring the virtues into sharper relief. It’s chill, adorable, and breathtaking. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em> was a sleeper hit in 2022 that now frequently appears in “best of” lists, a fantastically smart puzzle game in which you descended 100 floors of a tower to save your brother from a grisly sacrifice. Its sequel repeats the formula, but this time from a second perspective, a character you likely forgot meeting in the first game, going through her own 100-story challenge. And the result is an even smarter set of excellent puzzles and lovely dialogue that nimbly sets up the third and final part of the trilogy. — John Walker </p></div><div><p>If <em>Minit </em>were a slide puzzle game, it would look like <em>Slider</em>. You move pieces of the world around to rearrange, rebuild, and progress through it. It can be incredibly simple and devastatingly hard at the same time. It’s free and no one has an excuse not to give it a try. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Master Key</em> is another riff on<em> Zelda</em>. This one is is as monochromatic and stripped down as it gets, focusing on the items you collect and the obstacles they help you to overcome. It shares DNA with modern indie gems like <em>Animal Well</em> and <em>Tunic</em>, though it’s more rough around the edges. Do yourself a favor and play it on easy. —Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Too many games are mawkish, and not enough games are honestly sad. <em>The Night Is Grey</em>, with its wonderfully solemn and beautiful story, defies this trend. This point-and-click adventure is a tangle of haunted pasts, and one that is self-aware enough to avoid the traditionally silly puzzles of the genre, even coldly chastising the player when one such traditional, silly solution is tried. It’s a game about a man trying to protect a small child, but it rebels against the tropes of that formula in a way that’ll gut-punch you hard. — John Walker </p></div><div><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> is a <em>Morrowind</em>-inspired low-poly RPG that finally hit 1.0 this year and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896">didn’t disappoint</a></span>. What it lacks in deep first-person combat, it makes up for with an incredible-looking world to explore and a mythical atmosphere suffused with whimsy and horror. The exploration, writing, and story deliver an experience unlike any other. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>The Crimson Diamond</em> looks and plays like something from 1988, an adventure game with gorgeous, vibrant EGA graphics and a text parser interface. Yes, that means you must actually type things like “look” and “open door,” a thought which may have some potential players rolling their eyes, but it’s actually great! The game deftly pulls you into its early-20th-century murder mystery with its plucky heroine and colorful cast of suspects. The text parser, meanwhile, lets you engage with those suspects and the environment in delightful and engaging ways that, despite being nods to games from nearly 40 years ago, feel fresh and invigorating, and make me more optimistic about the state of the adventure game genre today. I’ll allow myself a pun here and just end by saying that this game is a real gem. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>If you like reading random internet pages about made-up things and then leveraging your new expertise in creepy, intimate scenarios with complete strangers, <em>Home Safety Hotline</em> is the game for you. It’s a <em>Papers, Please</em>-like that combines soul crushing call center work with a beautiful Windows 97 aesthetic and a Cryptid-infused riff on <em>Night Trap</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p> There are plenty of city builders on Steam, but not many (if any) are all about creating bustling towns on the side of a giant mountain. <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em>, out in Early Access, asks you to develop and grow thriving cities using tiny cliffs as you and your crew climb up a mountain. The game is a bit tricky at times, but at least the view is lovely up there. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for <i>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</i>Version 5.3, so if you're looking for a way to ring in the new year, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's Version 5.2</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous month's Version 5.1</a>, Version 5.3 will arrive on January 1st. That's right: New Year's Day itself. It'll continue the storyline of Natlan's Archon Quest, in which the Traveler is about to awaken their Pyro power and the six heroes of Natlan have united.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a HoYoverse game update without some new characters to enjoy, and Version 5.3 is bringing not one, but two 5-star characters for you to add to your roster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=2NDpnDAb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=WJRn_3vL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.3 brings two new 5-star characters for your roster.</figcaption></figure><p>Your first new 5-star character is the Pyro claymore user Mavuika, who comes with two distinct fighting styles. She can either take enemies on with the aforementioned claymore or use her Flamestrider to crush enemies. Said Flamestrider can also be used to traverse the world.</p>

<p>The second 5-star character joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.3 is Citlali, also known as Granny Itztli. She's a Cryo-using catalyst wielder who can deploy shields and deal powerful area-of-effect damage. Both characters are joined by the intriguing-sounding multi-elemental Liyue fighter Lan Yan, who debuts in the second half of the update.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect reruns of existing characters in case you missed the chance to add them to your team. Characters returning as part of this update include Arlecchino, Clorinde, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-ganyu-guide-builds-skills" rel="nofollow">Ganyu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>.</p>




<p>Plenty of other goodies are coming as part of Version 5.3 as well, including the return of the Lantern Rite event, the popular rhythm minigame becoming a permanent fixture, and optimizations to the character level up screen to make it a little easier to understand and parse.</p>

<p>As per usual, HoYoverse is also giving away some&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>goodies for those who are looking to build their roster. Here are this update's codes!</p>

<ul><li>UAMPGJASECZH: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic's board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you're not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they're already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The DoJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint">announced the resignations in a press release</a>, saying they're the result of an investigation into potential antitrust violations. The gist is: since Tencent are massive and own Riot Games outright, they aren't allowed to have boardroom sway over Epic Games, which technically remains their competitor in the video games industry. It'd be like letting a big suitwearer at Pepsi go to all the important meetings at Coca-cola. This is all law under the Clayton Act, which "prohibits directors and officers from serving simultaneously on the boards of competitors, subject to limited exceptions."</p>
<p>The two directors who've stepped down are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein, according to an <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/tencent-relinquishes-epic-games-board-seats-on-antitrust-concern?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=TENW&amp;utm_campaign=00000193-dd05-d3f6-a1d7-dd27d5ec0004">email Bloomberg got</a> from Epic Games confirming the resignations. Ben Feder's job title at Tencent for years was the President of International Partnerships, and he was CEO of Take-Two Interactive before that, a big Tencent publisher. Wallerstein, meanwhile, was Senior Executive Vice President at Tencent until January this year, and is currently employed as a "senior advisor". Neither of them should have been on the board at Epic - at least that's what is implied by the DoJ's investigations. And they have now stepped down, it seems, to avoid Tencent and Epic any further heat.</p>
<p>"No company or individual has admitted to liability in connection with this investigation," say the DoJ with characteristic legal nous. They also add that Tencent has agreed to amend its shareholder agreement with Epic so that it can't appoint directors to the Epic board in future. No more boardroom naughtiness, corpoboys and corpogirls! </p><p>Antitrust laws exist to prevent huge companies from establishing monopolies and becoming even more powerful than they often already are. In video games, we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judge-rules-part-of-antitrust-suit-against-valve-can-continue">Valve hit with an antitrust lawsuit</a> in the past. And Microsoft was scrutinised with similar concerns by both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/us-ftc-considering-antitrust-lawsuit-against-microsoft-over-activision-blizzard-deal-sources-claim">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-eu-are-slapping-microsoft-with-an-antitrust-warning-over-their-activision-blizzard-buyout">the European Union</a> when it made its (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">ultimately successful</a>) move to buy Activision Blizzard. Big business gonna business big.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Over the 12 years since its crowdfunding drive began, Star Citizen has been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch. Its virtual space ships, some of which cost hundreds of dollars, are often the focus of criticism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Star Citizen has now raised an eye-watering $767 million, according to figures from CIG. The developer makes revenue publicly available on its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>. CIG calls this money “funds raised.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-10-twinkles-on-the-horizon-dev-says-12-years-and-669-million-later"><u>CIG began talking about Star Citizen’s 1.0 launch being within sight</u></a>, although there’s still no release window for it. 1.0, Roberts has said, “is what we consider the features and content set to represent ‘commercial’ release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter from the Chairman post</a>, Roberts said: “Long ago, lost in the mists of time before COVID, at CitizenCon 2949, we showcased the first in-game prototype of traveling from the Stanton System to the Pyro System via a Jump Point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a much longer than anticipated development process, what was teased in 2019 becomes a reality for all players when we launch Star Citizen Alpha 4.0 to the live servers, as part of what we are calling the 4.0 Preview.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen Alpha 4.0 brings with it a full wipe and reset to all accounts. All players start fresh with their account hangars and wallets +20,000 aUEC (Alpha United Earth Credits, Star Citizen’s virtual currency used during the alpha stage). Headline additions include Pyro, the second Star System added to the Star Citizen Universe, the first jump point in the persistent universe, connecting the Stanton and Pyro systems together, an economy overhaul, and much more.

    <p><span>Mavuika and Citlali join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Incandescent Ode of Resurrection,” will launch on January 1, 2025, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-935765"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update will finally make Mavuika, the Pyro Archon, playable. The Traveler will join Mavuika and Natlan’s warriors in a fateful battle in the newest Archon Quest. In addition, players can revisit Liyue during Lantern Rite, celebrating Teyvat’s new year with bounteous rewards, including Intertwined Fates ×10, Primogems ×1,600, a free 4-star Liyue character and more.</p><p>The final battle tolls its bell, summoning Natlan’s warriors to rise in the new Act V of Natlan’s Archon Quest. In the previous main story, the six heroes of Natlan successfully united, and the sacred blessing of the Ode of Resurrection was extended to all Natlanese warriors. At long last, the Traveler is on the verge of awakening their Pyro power. Meanwhile, the Abyss will unleash a new evil into the world for the final showdown, the terrifying Abyssal Mimic Dragon, a Boss known as the “Lord of Eroded Primal Fire”.</p><p>Revered as Natlan’s most radiant protector during the Abyss wars, Mavuika, also known as the Pyro Archon Haborym, joins the battlefield with two unique combat styles: Fighting with her claymore, or crushing opponents while riding her Flamestrider. By tapping her Elemental Skill, the Ring of Searing Radiance manifests, following Mavuika or the active character and unleashing continuous Pyro attacks. By holding her Elemental Skill, Mavuika mounts her Flamestrider, allowing her to scale cliffs, drive across land and water alike, glide in mid-air, and charge into opponents in her path. By fighting alongside her teammates, Mavuika gains a unique resource called Fighting Spirit, used to activate her Elemental Burst. Her Elemental Burst unleashes a powerful AoE Pyro attack, and Mavuika will enter a special state with higher interruption resistance and enhanced combat power. Additionally, Mavuika can decrease the party’s Nightsoul Transmission Cooldown by 20%. Players can learn more about this stalwart warrior in her Story Quest, which unlocks after completing the latest Archon Quest.</p><p>In contrast to Mavuika’s blazing flames, “Granny Itztli,” otherwise known as Citlali from the Masters of the Night-Wind, brings a biting cold to the battlefield as a 5-star Cryo Catalyst user. A powerful Shaman revered by her tribe, Citlali is always accompanied by two little companions, Itzpapa and Citlalin. During exploration, they transform into cushions and pillows, allowing Citlali to comfortably float in mid-air. While in combat, Citlali can deploy Cryo shields and summon a powerful Cryo storm of AoE DMG with her little companions. While in her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, “Granny Itztli” lowers the Pyro and Hydro RES of opponents affected by Frozen or Melt reactions, even when Citlali is off-field. Both Mavuika and Citlali debut in the first half of Version 5.3’s Event Wishes, with reruns for Arlecchino and Clorinde arriving in the second half.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_935766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>A new Liyue character, Lan Yan, debuts as a 4-star Anemo Catalyst user in the second half of Version 5.3. One of her inherited Qimen Arts is the Swallow-Wisp Shield that can convert its Element into Hydro, Pyro, Cryo or Electro to absorb corresponding Elemental DMG. After the conversion, she can also leap into the air to attack, dealing the same type of Elemental DMG to her opponents. In addition, more 5-star characters will return in another round of Chronicled Wish, including Ganyu and Shenhe.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bustling Liyue Harbor is once again aglow with the cheer of Lantern Rite. Players can share in the festive joy through various free rewards, including Primogems ×1,600 and the new glider “Wings of Fate’s Course Intertwined” via in-game mails, Intertwined Fate ×10 through a daily login event, a free 4-star Liyue character by completing the Lantern Rite event, and a new outfit for Xiangling by accumulating Festive Fever in the event.</p><p>Besides the joy of reaping rewards, mini-games and events will be adding another layer of excitement to the festivities. This year, players can share their customized gift envelopes with companions and other Travelers, weaving their best wishes and sentiments into their works. They can also play the block clearing mini-game, “Immortal Combat,” as well as a combat challenge with Stratagem buffs to accumulate fun and Festive Fever alike. Once Festive Fever reaches a certain level, players can claim Xiangling’s new outfit “New Year’s Cheer” and more celebratory bonuses for free. Meanwhile, Hu Tao’s new outfit “Cherries Snow-Laden” will be on sale in the Shop at a limited-time discount.</p><p>Version 5.3 continues to offer new features for different in-game modes. The popular rhythm game will become a permanent gameplay mode, allowing players to compose and share musical scores to showcase their talents. Additionally, Kazuha and Ganyu’s Echo cosmetics will be added to Envisaged Echoes in the Imaginarium Theater lobby, and can be obtained after completing the corresponding new challenges.</p><p>This version is also committed to further optimizing the character level-up process. The character interface now includes a button leading directly to the Training Guide. Artifacts, Weapons, and Character overviews in the Training Guide have been made clearer and easier to understand. The Artifact Inventory Limit will also be increased to 2,100, affording players more space and flexibility in Artifact management. Additionally, Boss enemies will respawn in just 5 seconds after claiming rewards without the need to teleport away, ensuring a smoother, more efficient process for obtaining character level-up materials.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,589 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,519 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,023 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

        <p>The full game will feature seven zones and over 20 hours of gameplay.</p><p><strong>New Gameplay Teaser Reveals Two Zones</strong></p><p>The world of <em>ReSetna</em> is full of mysteries, and the latest reveal gives players a glimpse into the creation of the Darkness Zone, the desolate region of Acidia, and even some of the game’s bosses.</p><p>Acidia was once the home of Energetech Solutions, a company focused on renewable energy. Their experiments with Entropium, a powerful but unstable synthetic substance, caused massive damage to the environment.</p><p>These reckless tests tore holes in space and time, creating the Darkness Zone, a strange and chaotic dimension where the rules of reality are distorted.</p><p>Now, Acidia is a toxic and dangerous wasteland, filled with the remnants of advanced technology and the scars of Entropium’s devastating effects. </p><p><strong>Original Soundtrack That Mirrors a Decayed World</strong></p><p>Crafted by composer Nikola Jeremic, the <em>ReSetna</em> soundtrack fuses organic and synthetic sounds to reflect the post-apocalyptic setting. </p><p>Using real instruments like metal and wood, distorted to sound “dirty” and “decayed,” Jeremic’s score blends retro synthwave and ambientwave elements. </p><p>The result is a unique soundscape that breathes life into <em>ReSetna</em>‘s world of forgotten machines.</p><p><strong>All Game Art Elements Born Purely From Imagination</strong></p><p>Every character, enemy and environment in <em>ReSetna</em> has been meticulously crafted by Today’s Games’ art team.</p><p>“Each boss is unique, telling a dark story of the forgotten past. Through our art, we sought to let the visuals speak for themselves, embracing the power of visual storytelling,” the team explained. </p><p><strong>Great News for Players Worldwide</strong></p><p><em>ReSetna</em> features a unique Tetris Chip Upgrade System, allowing players to collect and customize upgrades for abilities and weapons. This flexible system encourages exploration and strategic play to overcome increasingly difficult challenges.</p><p><em>ReSetna</em> will be localized into English, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish (Latin), Portuguese (Latin), German, French, and Russian. This effort ensures that players across the globe can fully immerse themselves in the story and world of <em>ReSetna</em>.</p><p>This <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [179 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> is set to launch worldwide on January 31, 2025 on Steam and <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,455 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, with releases on other consoles following in Q1 2025.</p><p>For those eager to experience the gameplay, a demo is available now on Steam. The demo offers a polished introduction to <em>ReSetna</em>, featuring the entire first zone Polis13 and an intense boss fight. </p><p>However, the full game features six more zones, each boasting vibrant, colorful, and mystical art styles.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Three stories, one common foe—the arrogant and disdainful “Nine Tailed-Fox.”</p><p><strong>The Immortal Ninja: Shigure</strong></p><p>Three hundred years ago, a human named “Yasha” slaughtered demons, causing nightmares for the demon world under the Blood Moon. With the vanishing of “Yasha,” the Blood Moon ended, and a delicate balance was achieved between humans and demons. However, three hundred years later, the balance is shattered as vicious demons raid the Ninja Village.

                <p>This weekend, the NFL game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans may play a role in determining the No. 1 seed in the AFC. It also has the distinction of being the first-ever EA Sports Madden NFL Cast, an alternate broadcast that will stream exclusively on Peacock.</p><p>The traditional broadcast of the game will remain on NBC, but Peacock's stream will incorporate elements from the Madden NFL video games. For example, Madden's signature passing routes and player ratings will be overlaid on the live-action footage, and the game may incorporate animations from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a> as well. This altcast is being produced specifically with Madden gamers in mind, some of whom may not be traditional football fans.</p><p>"There are millions and millions of Madden fans, and I think we have to really serve them in this game and try to find that perfect blend between the video game and the real game and merge them together," said NBC Sports executive producer Fred Gaudelli in a statement.</p><p>The EA Sports Madden NFL Cast will begin on Saturday, December 21 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Peacock. Paul Burmeister will provide the play-by-play commentary for the altcast, with former NFL quarterback Kurt Benkert placing the Madden graphic overlays to breakdown potential plays. Former wide receiver Chad Johnson will also contribute as he makes adjustments to players' Madden ratings in real-time. Ultimate Madden Bowl champion player Henry Leverette will take part in the production as well.</p><p>Madden's namesake, John Madden, was a former NFL coach-turned-broadcaster who announced games for all of the major broadcast networks, including NBC. The video game franchise that is synonymous with his name carries so much weight that a report this week suggested that New York Jets owner Woody Johnson vetoed a trade for Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-york-jets-owner-torpedoed-trade-because-of-a-players-madden-rating-report/1100-6528565/" data-ref-id="1100-6528565">because he didn't like Jeudy's Madden player ratting</a>.</p><p>EA recently updated Madden NFL 25 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saquon-barkleys-no-look-hurdle-has-been-added-to-madden-nfl-25/1100-6527917/" data-ref-id="1100-6527917">Saquon Barkley's unique no-look spin hurdle into the game</a>, although it can only be performed under specific circumstances.

The market is expected to decline further in 2025, in line with Omdia’s earlier projections. The outlook reflects a challenging period for the consumer VR industry ahead of a forecasted rebound in 2026. In this blog I lay out key drivers behind the downturn in 2024, as well as the factors driving the assumed growth in 2026 and beyond.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR headset sales see two consecutive years of decline, following the pandemic-induced upswing">VR headset sales see two consecutive years of decline, following the pandemic-induced upswing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The consumer VR market continues to face significant challenges, with several indicators highlighting a lack of momentum and adoption. The highly anticipated Apple Vision Pro debut has failed to deliver the resurgence the industry hoped for, with limited developer enthusiasm and fading momentum ten months post-launch. Meanwhile, Meta’s recent entry-level Quest 3S has yet to spark a notable sales boost, as evidenced by my analysis of Black Friday headset sales across eight countries, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/giokinto.bsky.social/post/3lcnkdzfdhs2p">which shows a 16% decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. PC VR adoption also remains stagnant, with Valve’s latest Hardware Survey revealing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgejijiashvili_vr-pcvr-vr-activity-7265701366692487168-Nb7h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">only 1.5% of Steam users are engaging with VR</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hardware. Adding to this, Omdia’s supply chain insights confirm earlier reports of Sony </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/sony-hits-pause-on-psvr2-production-as-unsold-inventory-piles-up">halting PlayStation VR2 production</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> due to unsold inventory, prompting the company to resort to heavy discounting to clear stock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges are further exacerbated in other markets and segments. VR headset sales in China have collapsed due to weak consumer demand, and the future of Pico remains uncertain following layoffs and restructuring by its parent company, ByteDance. The TikTok owner, which acquired Pico in 2021, appears to be losing interest in the segment. On the content side, developers are increasingly questioning the return on investment for VR games, with a recent Game Developer Collective survey revealing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-says-half-of-developers-consider-vr-market-on-decline-or-stagnation">half of respondents perceive the VR market as either stagnant or in decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of VR headsets in active use fell by 8% in 2024 to 21.9 million. This was primarily due to a low share of Quest 2 owners upgrading, over 20 million of which have been sold since 2020. Meanwhile, $904 million was spent on VR content in 2024; for context, games console content spend will generate $37.4 billion in 2024, highlighting the nascent nature of the consumer VR market. The current state of the VR market is characterized by waning consumer interest post-pandemic, a sluggish inflow of compelling new content, and growing skepticism among developers about the viability of VR as a profitable platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Growth is predicted to resume by 2026, but mass adoption of VR headsets in their current form remains unlikely">Growth is predicted to resume by 2026, but mass adoption of VR headsets in their current form remains unlikely</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expected return to growth in the VR market is heavily reliant on the anticipated launch of a more affordable Apple Vision Pro model in 2026, which is projected to drive the market expansion through 2029. Meta is also expected to remain a key player in the space, though its headset sales are likely to remain flat. Meta’s recent move to open its Horizon OS to third-party manufacturers underscores its continued commitment to VR, but the company faces an uphill battle. Meanwhile, Google’s announcement of the Android XR platform last week represents a much-needed competition in this space, but its history of launching and shortly shuttering new projects tempers expectations. Developer and manufacturer approach to these initiatives will be cautious, therefore, only incremental progress is anticipated in the short-term.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The form factor of current VR and passthrough mixed reality headsets remains a barrier to mass adoption. Consumer and manufacturer interest is shifting toward lightweight glasses, promising all-day, anywhere access to multimodal AI – as exemplified by Meta Ray-Ban glasses, which is seeing early signs of success. Companies in this space hope that this approach will help normalize face-based spatial computing, which could ultimately spur mass-market VR adoption. However, the progress towards achieving this will be slow, and isn’t expected to happen within this decade. In the near term, VR is likely to remain a niche market, constrained by its existing limitations and the growing industry focus on AR as the future of immersive technology.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-amd-fsr-3-mod-released-by-puredark/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-amd-fsr-3-mod-released-by-puredark.1066161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-amd-fsr-3-mod-released-by-puredark/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, renowned modder PureDark <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/indiana-jones-01-118058876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an AMD FSR 3 mod for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. As usual, the mod is locked behind being a subscriber on his Patreon, and even PureDark told his community:</p>
<p><em>Note that the devs have announced that future updates will include official FSR3 implementation. Think twice before subscribing!</em></p>
<p>Indeed, developer MachineGames confirmed alongside the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second title update</a> that AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution would be added in a future patch. However, they didn't specifically state whether that would also include the frame generation component, which is indeed available in PureDark's mod and makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Not only that, it even works on portable devices like Valve's Steam Deck. YouTuber Grown Up Gaming tested it and noticed that the performance went from 20-25 frames per second to around 40 frames per second with the upscaling set to Quality. Lowering that to Performance mode provides another 10 frames or so, but at that point, the game doesn't look very good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steam Deck Indiana Jones and the Great Circle FSR 3 Frame Generation Mod #steamdeck #fsr3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BE40VHIbs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Granted, it is a miracle Indiana Jones and the Great Circle even works on the Steam Deck. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system requirements</a> technically include hardware ray tracing support, and we all know that the Deck's ray tracing performance is not its strongest suit, to say the least.</p>
<p>It's certainly not like I would like to play this game. If I absolutely had to do it on the go, I'd prefer using GeForce NOW to stream it via cloud and still get ray tracing features and smooth performance. PureDark's mod will probably be more useful to all those desktop users who do not own an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU, providing a way to essentially double the frame rate for free.</p>
<p>Whether you plan to use it or not, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is absolutely worth playing, as I explained in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>At least one story DLC titled The Order of the Giants is on its way, though there's no release window yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced the&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, as well as unveiling the game's first full trailer in anticipation of that date.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed last week</a>, and as part of that reveal, Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Keen Games) promised an Early Access release date the following week.</p>

<p>Now, that time has come;&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will officially arrive in Early Access on January 27th, so make sure to mark that date on your calendar if you're looking forward to some co-op space engineering fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date-space-base.jpg?itok=j35s3ikz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date-space-base.jpg?itok=JlJin-fH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to Early Access in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In an announcement post revealing the Early Access date, Keen Software House says that rather than being a small update to the formula,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>represents a "complete reimagining of the space engineering experience".</p>

<p>Plenty of new systems and gameplay mechanics will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, a brand new engine with "better performance and future optimization potential", and improved visuals, among many other changes.</p>

<p>If you pick up&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>in Early Access, you'll gain, erm, access to what Keen Software House calls the "first vertical slice" of the game, which will consist of its Creative Mode. This mode will show off many of the game's new tools and features, so if you're looking to get an idea of what&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will be capable of in the future, the Early Access release is the place to go.</p>




<p>In future, Keen Software House says it'll keep updating&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>with new "vertical slices", each of which will expand the game's "features and content". In essence, it sounds like they'll work just like most Early Access game updates do.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th.</p>

<p>For the unaware, Skibidi Toilet is an animated web series created by Alexey Gerasimov on his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">DaFuq!?Boom!</a>. The series is known for its absurd humour and its creation in Garry's Mod using assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>The series has since become a popular meme, which Epic is now leaning into with this addition to Fortnite. I guess anything goes these days.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The Doro C300 Pro Ergonomic chair is ideal for users who greatly value a tailored and advanced adjustment system and offers features that make it truly stand out. We will take a quick look at some of its key features below, and you can also <a href="http://cutt.ly/ceNhnzsD" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">head over to the official store</a> for more detailed info.</p>
<h3>Self-adaptive Lumbar Support</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 Pro comes with a Body Movement Tracking system that provides automatic lumbar support adjustment as you move or change positions so that it aligns perfectly with your spine without constantly having to make adjustments manually. This seamless comfort helps reduce the chances of feeling fatigued due to the consistent lower back support.</p>
<h3>Bigger Waterfall-Shaped Cushion with Seat Depth Adjustment<strong><br>
</strong></h3>
<p>The large waterfall-shaped cushion the chair is packed with helps users feel more comfortable, especially during longer sittings, due to the pressure it relieves from the thighs and improves overall circulation. The seat depth adjustment allows users to personalize their sitting experience by adjusting it to their body size and leg length, which also aids in maintaining proper posture.</p>
<h3>Complete Control in One Handle</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 Pro comes with enhanced functionality as the operations can be controlled through one handle only, which is placed on the right-hand side of the chair. Real-life adjustments can give users a seamless experience through an interrupted workflow by effortlessly adapting to various needs. Providing a generous maximum recline angle of 135°, the Sihoo Doro C300 Pro enables you to relax in a more comfortable position when you require a brief break from your work.</p>
<h3>Flexible Seat Back-Contouring to Your Back</h3>

The design mimics the natural alignment of the spine, allowing for better posture and reduced pressure on the back.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Sihoo Doro C300 Ergonomic Office Chair</h2>
<p>Sihoo Doro C300 is the company's selling product, and if you look at the design, you will find the Doro C300 and the Doro C300 Pro chair to be almost identical, with minor differences only. The product is well received by users, especially those who seek good value for money. Some users who have shared their experience with the chair even went ahead and painted the Pro model as merely a refreshed version rather than offering some major Pro model upgrades. The Doro C300 is perfect for users who are looking for a chair that provides all-day support and helps with chronic back pain with effective lumbar support.</p>
<p>The listed price of the Doro C300 Ergonomic Chair on the<a href="https://sihoooffice.com/products/sihoo-doro-c300-ergonomic-office-chair" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener"> official website</a> is<b> $399.99</b> for the black model, but the promotional offer brings the price to only<b> $239.99</b>. Similarly, the white version's original price is <b>$409.99, </b>but with the ongoing promotion, it can be purchased for only <b>$249.99</b>. Just like with the Pro model, the Doro C300 chair's Christmas and New Year Special is available for only a limited time, so for users who have been wanting to upgrade, now is the time.</p>
<p>Similar to the C300 Pro model, the C300 offers self-adaptive lumbar support that automatically adapts itself according to the natural contour of your spine, allowing for continuous support and more comfort by reducing the strain on the back. Other features that make the model stand out include:</p>
<h3>Flexible Backrest</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 has a streamlined design that supports movement, especially upper body support. Its triangular frame design ensures a continuous flexible backrest with a supportive structure.</p>
<h3>Wide Multi-Adjustable Headrest</h3>
<p>The Doro C300 chair is perfect for gaming sessions or even work that requires long sitting. It is equipped with a 3D mechanical headrest that provides support for your head and neck and reduces tension in the neck and shoulder that can be caused by extended use.</p>
<h3>Adaptable Mechanism and Comfortable Reclining</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 comes with an advanced, adaptable mechanism and a comfortable reclining mechanism that can help tailor the seating experience according to users' preferences. The tilt angles are varied and can go up to 130 degrees for dynamic lumbar support.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers a 4D directional armrest with varied adjustment options, allowing you to comfortably rest your arms in different positions, whether at work or even when playing a game. The Doro C300 ensures comfort with its waterfall-shaped seat, which offers extensive seating support by optimally distributing the weight.</p>

Initially, Hothead focused on developing and publishing digital console and PC titles, but eventually pivoted to focus on creating free-to-play mobile games (with mixed results).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We threw all kinds of small, inexpensive games at the wall to see what stuck.&nbsp; Surprise surprise, surprise nothing stuck," wrote Wilkinson, looking back on that period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, we went back to our roots and created sports games under the Big Win brand and shooting games under the Rivals at War (RAW) brand and eventually the Kill Shot brand.&nbsp;These series of games were very successful–we finally discovered lightning in a bottle.&nbsp;Those were the most successful years for Hothead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the past year, Hothead had been working on a playable prototype for a triple-A project.

"They were both ready to close two weeks ago and then the mobile publisher pulled out due to a change in strategy. Two weeks later the console publisher also pulled out.&nbsp;At that point our only remaining option was bankruptcy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back on Hothead's legacy, Wilkinson said it wasn't the games that made the studio-but rather its people. "Hothead was chock full of incredibly, smart, talented, loyal, hardworking but mostly just really nice people.&nbsp;People that had your back at work and outside of work.&nbsp;Many of us made lifelong friends at Hothead," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We grew up together, we laughed, we cried, we celebrated, we grieved, we found partners, we started families.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/monster-hunter-wilds-pre-launch-update-addresses-open-beta-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Capcom has hosted a pre-launch community update for Monster Hunter Wilds, responding to player feedback from the open beta. The update goes into the changes players can expect when Monster Hunter Wilds launches, including performance targets, weapon balancing, and equipping skills for your gear. The full community update is approximately one hour and 20 minutes long, so there is a summary after the video. Capcom has stated that things mentioned in the video could change in the future, and there are more things the developers are addressing that were not covered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Pre-Launch Community Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWqiYSA-t8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’ performance is the first topic that is touched upon in the video, particularly the Steam version. In the update, one of the big announcements is that the development team may be able to lower the recommended graphics board specs. On the console side the prioritise gameplay will be locked at 30fps while prioritising framerate will lock at 60fps. On the Xbox Series S however, it looks like the framerate will be 30fps.</p>
<p>The gameplay changes coming to Monster Hunter Wilds include making weapon hits feeling more weighty, especially when it comes to finishers and big moves. Friendly fire will also be mitigated further including for upswinging hammer attacks. The Shockproof Jewel will allow players to negate damage reactions too. Pop up camps and fast travel will be available in the full version, so you will not have to slog it all the way to a monster’s location. The rate at which monsters move between different locations will be brought in line with Monster Hunter World. In the Wilds beta, monsters were frequently moving between areas and this was a glitch that has been addressed.</p>
<p>Weapons have been adjusted for the main release as well, with Insect Glaive, Lance, Switch Axe and Sword &amp; Shield being the ones that players will notice most of the changes for. For the Insect Glaive the Vaulting Dance move will be back, increasing the power of aerial attacks. The Lance will be getting a a Charge Counter, which was previously Counter Thrust. Counter attacks can also be chosen for the Lance. The Switch Axe will be easier to use in the full release too by making it simpler to perform some of the weapon’s moves like Counter Rising Slash. For Sword and Shield the Rising Slash will be usable while guarding, and responsiveness of moves like Perfect Rush has been improved too.</p>

<p>There will be a change to how skills are equipped in Monster Hunter Wilds too. Previously, skills were only equipped to armour but in Wilds, skills will be available for weapons as well. Attack and Guard skills will be equipped to weapons, while other skills like speed eating will be for armour. Upgrading weapons will also provide the chance for skills to upgrade, more skill slots to be unlocked, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Another open beta for Monster Hunter Wilds is being considered, but it would be more for players who did not get to play it the first time, and there would likely only be a couple of additional options added. The changes that were discussed in the update would also not be likely to feature in another open beta, if one was to go ahead. Monster Hunter Wilds is set for 28th February 2025, and it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has quietly released a new game based on its Captain Laserhawk animated series, which features beloved mascot Rayman and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E., as spotted by Game File's Stephen Totilo (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file">Polygon</a>), is a PC top-down multiplayer shooter that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Though it's technically in early access, Totilo described it as "the most basic top-down shooter imaginable".</p>
<p>Players require an NFT Niji Warrior ID card to play, which itself requires a crypto wallet to purchase (the NFT costs $25.63).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-wild-far-cry-blood-dragon-anime-captain-laserhawk-welcomes-rayman-in-new-trailer">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a> was created by Ubisoft for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and released last year. It's based on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> spin-off Blood Dragon and features multiple characters from across Ubisoft's games, including Rayman.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/faq">FAQ</a> for this game based on the series, it's a "transmedia gaming adventure where the community drives the narrative through innovative governance".</p>
<p>It continues: "Eden Online is the layer which gives power to the community when it comes to decision making for the game updates each season.</p>
<p>"Eligibility to play the game in early access will be reflected by ownership of a Citizen ID Card. Eden Online has a limited capacity of 10,000 seats for citizenship."</p>
<p>Once an ID has been purchased, which Totilo stated is a convoluted process, it's customised with a cartoon headshot and further details to make it unique. Then, as a <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK/the-niji-warrior-id-your-gateway-to-elite-gaming-privileges-in-captain-laserhawk-6fff29b24f23">Medium post</a> on the game reads, your "Niji Warrior NFT is dynamic", meaning it "evolves by capturing your in-game accomplishments, growing in uniqueness and value, and showcasing your dedication and skill".</p>
<p>You can then sell your ID as an NFT, though it's unclear why anyone would wish to.</p>
<p>Rayman, meanwhile, features as the announcer of the game's deathmatches.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">Ubisoft announced Quartz</a>, its "energy-efficient" NFT platform for AAA games, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">didn't appear to be a success</a>.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-to-continue-with-nft-platform-quartz-despite-criticism">criticism</a>, Ubisoft has ploughed on. Back in October this year it quietly released its first-ever blockchain game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k"> tactical NFT battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</a> where players purchase NFT figurines to battle using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now it's added Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. to its growing NFT portfolio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Catly developers SuperAuthenti have released gameplay of its game following allegations that the game used AI for its trailer that was shown during 2024’s The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Despite SuperAuthenti shooting down the allegations repeatedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/catly-devs-no-ai-used-in-the-trailer-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers seemingly couldn’t escape accusations</a> that the game had used AI and web3 technologies. A PR representative said, “We are very surprised by such speculations. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion.”</p>



<p>The developers have since uploaded gameplay <span>to its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>St</span>eam page</a>, which shows that the game is real and uses Unreal Engine 5.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Catly’s game description reads, “An open-world adventure filled with surprises and joy, side by side with Cats! Build your dream island, meet various characters, and enjoy caring for your cats, dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more! Explore freely and have endless fun with your furry companions!”</p>



<p>As for whether the original reveal trailer used AI or not remains to be seen, but the recent gameplay trailer release begs the question of why the developers didn’t release it in the first place. After all, there should have been some internal concerns that the original reveal trailer looked somewhat dodgy. </p>



<p>What do you think of Catly’s gameplay video? Have the developers regained trust with its recent trailer? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>A sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is being considered "positively" but studio Tango Gameworks is "considering various opportunities" before fully committing.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-director-i-want-to-cherish-this-ip">IGN</a>, studio head Colin Mack, Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira discussed the future of the franchise.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft closed Tango Gameworks</a> it was acquired by Krafton. At the time of the acquisition a sequel to rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush had begun, but Mack has now clarified the studio is considering its options.</p>

<p>"We are considering a sequel positively," said Mack. "We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, 'This is what we're going to do'."</p>
<p>"Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options," added Johanas. "We're currently at the stage of considering various opportunities."</p>
<p>Johanas stated many members of the development team have a "strong attachment" to Hi-Fi Rush, adding: "Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP."</p>
<p>However he believes it's "important to try new things", which is seemingly a philosophy that itself led to the development of Hi-Fi Rush - a clear change in tone for the studio following <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Egashira said creating new experiences is "in the DNA of Tango Gameworks".</p>
<p>"Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated," he said. "I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the centre, without losing our passion."</p>
<p>As previously reported, Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">a build for a Hi-Fi Rush sequel was about six months old</a> ahead of the studio acquisition.</p>
<p>"[Tango] want to make sure [it] surpasses the expectations of the existing fans," said Park. "For instance, some of the feedback about Hi-Fi Rush was that some people felt it was [just] going through factories, so now they want to give a more open world type of experience. I don't think it's going to be completely open world, but a more dynamic environment [that] you play in. Also, having more advanced technology applied to the rhythm action so that it feels more synchronised."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A fourth Sonic the Hedgehog film is on the way, with a spring 2027 release date.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/">Variety</a>, Paramount is currently preparing for a new film as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> releases in cinemas this weekend.</p>
<p>Fans have already been speculating which new characters will be introduced in the post-credits of the third film, who will undoubtedly be the focus of the inevitable fourth film.</p>

<p>The first two Sonic the Hedgehog films have earned a combined global box office total of $725.2m, with the third film expected to top the box office this Christmas season.</p>
<p>Plot details for Sonic the Hedgehog 4 are obviously being kept under wraps for the moment, so it's unclear who from the cast will return.</p>
<p>Jeff Fowler has directed all three Sonic films, with Ben Schwartz as the voice of the titular blue blur and Jim Carrey as antagonist Dr. Robotnik.</p>
<p>The third film introduces Shadow the Hedgehog from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> game, voiced here by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p>"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Eurogamer Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.</p>
<p>"Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-demo-now-available-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Bokeh Game Studio announced the release of a free Slitterhead demo on all platforms. This demo lets players try out the game's first chapter (tutorial included), and its save data will carry over to the full game if they purchase it afterward. On that note, 30% discounts are now available on PlayStation, Steam, and Epic Game Store; there are no discounts for the Xbox version, though.</p>
<p>In addition, the physical PS5 Day 1 Edition, which is distributed in North America by XSEED Games, is now available at a $10 discount off the MSRP of $59.99. It includes a physical copy of the game, a CD with original songs from the game composed by Akira Yamaoka, an art book with over 100 pages of gruesome details, and a sticker sheet, all packaged in a custom outer box.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/unnamed-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There was a fair amount of anticipation for Slitterhead ahead of its release, mostly because the game has been designed by Keiichiro Toyama, the legendary creator of Silent Hill and Gravity Rush, among other games.</p>
<p>However, the game wasn't received as well as Bokeh Game Studio hoped for. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/slitterhead-three-nights-kowlong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game was rated just 6.3 out of 10. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about his experience with Slitterhead:</p>
<p><em>For Bokeh Game Studio’s inaugural title, Slitterhead is such a strange anomaly to try and recommend over the other horror games that have topped 2024’s list of new releases. Those intimately familiar with Keiichiro Toyama’s general vibes would gladly find some enjoyment in his new studio’s new IP, but it can be tough to recommend for fans who haven’t already been lured in with the premise of a playable Wong War-Kai experience. Slitterhead is an experience that's fantastic in still shots or in story trailers but the actual gameplay becomes a muddled mess when the player is forced into repetitive chase and combat sequences.</em></p>

			<p>Game developer and publisher Maximum Entertainment has announced a new first-person sniper simulation game titled Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi. It was developed in collaboration with Brandon Webb, a former SEAL Sniper course Head Instructor, to achieve a realistic gaming experience. As a SEAL sniper, you'll navigate high-stakes environments, operate lifelike weapon systems, and rely on your skill to complete dynamic, high-stakes objectives under pressure.</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to conduct advanced training in long-range shooting in various environmental conditions that influence the elevation and wind compensations. They'll also get to master tactical techniques such as milling, stalking, and creating hides.</p>
<p>They will perform authentic interactions with their sniper rifles, from manual scope adjustments to bolt operation and a full suite of ballistics influenced by weather, distance, and ammunition types.</p>
<p>Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi takes place in the titular city located in the Al-Anbar province of Iraq. Here, players will explore anything from urban enclaves to open farm grounds, with locations inspired by real operations made by the SEAL team. Mission types will include&nbsp;Special Reconnaissance, Area Surveillance, Overwatch, and High-Value Target neutralization.</p>
<p>Maximum Entertainment promises 'endless replayability' thanks to emergent events such as ambushes and IED discoveries. The game also supports an online cooperative mode where players team up with a spotter to communicate, strategize, and control the battlefield. While one player focuses on communications, intel, and firing solution calculations, the other executes high-stakes precision shots with no room for error. Over the course of the game, it will be possible to unlock new weapon systems, attachments, and equipment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/top-call-of-duty-players-to-watch-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s 2025 season is in full flow, and there are plenty of players on the board eager to prove themselves this year. It has been a mixed bag of matches to kickstart the competitive season, and some shockers have been handed out. In the opening weeks of the CDL 2025 season, Atlanta FaZe plummeted to the bottom of the table, sending shockwaves through COD’s community.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to break down the top Call of Duty players to watch in 2025. From the upcoming rookie talent to the future world champions, this list covers everyone worth watching this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mixed-bag">Mixed Bag</h2>



<p>Here are the players you should keep an eye on as the competitive season unfolds.</p>



<h3 id="h-isaiah-gwinn-gwinn">Isaiah ‘Gwinn’ Gwinn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gwinn hit the ground running this year with the Carolina Royal Ravens. He served an instrumental role in the team being propelled to the top of the table, securing a perfect record in the opening weeks against some capable squads, including Atlanta FaZe. He was pivotal in handing FaZe the first 0 – 3 loss the team has secured in almost two years.</p>



<p>By mid-December, Gwinn was sitting on a KD of 1.34, leading the pack and standing atop some of the best Call of Duty players in the world.</p>



<h3 id="h-thomas-scrap-ernst">Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scrap’s ascension has been a glorious thing to watch. He started as a loud-mouthed rookie on Toronto Ultra, beefing with anyone who would look in his direction. He eventually mellowed and became much more rounded out as a player, but the Call of Duty League Championship has remained out of reach for him two years in a row.</p>



<p>With a second-place finish in 2023 and a third-place finish in 2024, it’s only a matter of time before this world-class player secures his trophy, and this year, he’s backed by a killer team on LA Thieves.</p>



<h3 id="h-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro">Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s impossible to jot down the most electrifying competitors in COD esports and <strong>not </strong>include Shotzzy. For years, this young pro player has been a superstar of the game, securing two world championships and dominating from every angle. He’s one of the most entertaining players to watch, and many consider him to be godlike on the sticks.</p>



<p>Last year, he secured the world championship with OpTic Texas, and he’s already started strong this season. In Black Ops 6, Shotzzy can make the most of Omnimovement, flying around the map with reckless abandon, and even if he doesn’t go back-to-back at CDL Champs, he’s one of the most hilarious players to watch, period.</p>



<h3 id="h-khalid-khhx-almadhi">Khalid ‘Khhx’ Almadhi</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Khhx is one of the newest players in the Call of Duty League, entering the fray with the Vegas Falcons, an all-new squad backed by a Saudi Arabian investment. Fans wrote off the Vegas Falcons ahead of the competitive season, and a donut hasn’t helped the squad gain much traction, but a standout member of the team is Khalid ‘Khhx’ Almadhi.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, the Vegas Falcons boasted a 0 – 4 win record and a 14% map win percentage, which is woeful, but Khhx has been working like gangbusters to escape the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>



<p>His debut match against the Royal Ravens was a loss, but it saw him secure a solid opening KD, and per the stats, he went on to hit a 1.28 KD in his second spin, becoming the first player to kickstart his tenure in the CDL with two matches above a 1.2 KD. To open the season, he sat above the likes of Dashy and Pred in terms of overall KD.</p>



<h3 id="h-paco-hydra-rusiewiez">Paco ‘HyDra’ Rusiewiez</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>HyDra has been a phenomenal player year in, year out since debuting with the New York Subliners in 2021. In the Modern Warfare II season, he skyrocketed to success with the squad, securing two Major wins and a world championship victory, along with a smattering of MVP awards.</p>



<p>Last season, he snatched a second-place finish at COD Champs, securing some of the most exhilarating plays in the wider tournament and cementing himself as one to watch for years to come. This year, he’s flying the LA Thieves banner alongside Envoy, Scrap, and Ghosty, which many consider to be one of the greatest potential-filled rosters <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>He has opened the season with a 1.18 overall KD and a perfect record of 4 – 0, at the time of publishing. Few players are more worthy of your time or attention than HyDra.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/naoe-fastest-assassin-ever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naoe-will-be-%E2%80%98the-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made%E2%80%99-ubisoft-says.1066056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/naoe-fastest-assassin-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released early next year, and already the game has started splitting the community down the middle. Since the title was revealed by Ubisoft earlier this year, it has proven to be a divisive game, and nobody truly knows how to feel about it. It was given a significant pushback by Ubisoft already, as it was supposed to be released in October 2024.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ubisoft’s Jonathan Dumont took a deep dive into Naoe, one of the game’s lead characters who fights alongside Yasuke, the first assassin in the series based on someone who <strong>actually existed</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-speedy">Super Speedy</h2>



<p>In the interview with Entertainment Weekly, the creative director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, explained the advantages of Naoe, a ‘shinobi’-style character with insane agility levels:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Naoe’s the fastest Assassin we ever made. She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn’t have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed fans spent years begging for a title to surface set in Japan, but when it was finally revealed, it left many feeling disappointed. Given that Ubisoft was beaten to the punch by the likes of Ghost of Tsushima, a high bar has been set that the current Ubisoft formula might not be able to reach.</p>



<p>The proof will be in the pudding, though.</p>



<p>In 2023, Ubisoft released Assassin’s Creed Mirage, and it was taken in remarkably well by fans because it was a small-form game that was seen as a return to the more classic AC experience. In AC Shadows, it’s back to the gargantuan open-world RPG model.</p>



<p>In Shadows, Naoe’s story is all about self-discovery and the betterment of her character and those close to her. Dumont explored that in the interview with <a href="https://ew.com/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-backstory-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made-exclusive-8762696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught. Can she make a better world?</p>



<p>The Hidden Blade is given by her father, and we’re going to learn a little bit more what that means.</p>



<p>She does feel like a panther looking at her prey.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch amidst a packed release window on February 14 – are you looking forward to the game? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
