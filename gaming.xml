			<p>Though the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature will be part of next-gen game development, it won't see massive adoption on PlayStation 6 and the next generation Xbox, especially in the cross-generation period.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627665">commented</a> on the possibility of next-generation consoles having access to the DirectX 12 Work Graphs feature, which delivers better performance and improved scalbility across complex workloads including procedural generation, particle systems and AI logic, saying that while <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-%E2%80%98top-of-mind%E2%80%99-exploring-%E2%80%98new-and-enhanced%E2%80%99-ways-to-play.1685298/post-270627867">hardware and API will be ready</a>, it is unlikely to see widespread adoption, as the engines and tools currently in use don't support this style of graphics programming. As such, it will be a while to see if the feature will bring significant performance improvements on consoles that go well beyond what we have already seen on PC<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-performance-boost/"> shortly after its release.</a></p>



<p>Very little is currently known about next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft, other than the fact that they are in the works. While rumors on the next Xbox are scarce, there's been considerably more unconfirmed information on the PlayStation 6, which is supposedly launching in two different editions - a home console and a portable system speculated to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/">more powerful than the Xbox Series S </a>that will be able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">run PlayStation 5 games natively</a>, although performance may not be great without developer intervention.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bithell Games and publisher Big Fan have announced that fast-paced tactical game&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted from all storefronts in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will be removed from digital storefronts on July 17th. That includes PC and consoles; as the two studios say, as of that date, "new purchases of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront".</p>

<p>However, if you do already own the game, then you'll still be able to play it after that date. That includes both physical and digital copies, thankfully, so it's not completely disappearing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/john-wick-hex-delisting-shooting.jpg?itok=WjI3_x27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/john-wick-hex-delisting-shooting.jpg?itok=8kNE40Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted this week.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, it's a tactical strategy game created by&nbsp;<em>Thomas Was Alone&nbsp;</em>and <i>Subsurface Circular&nbsp;</i>developer Mike Bithell under his Bithell Games label.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-goes-tactical-on-epic-store-with-john-wick-hex" rel="nofollow">in May 2019</a> and released in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-hex-launches-for-pc-on-october-8th-consoles-to-follow" rel="nofollow">October that same year</a>, the game takes place prior to the events of the popular&nbsp;<em>John Wick&nbsp;</em>movies. It sees the titular hitman descending into the underworld to rescue allies Winston and Charon from a new enemy calling himself Hex.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>offers what Bithell calls "fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game", with the gameplay "capturing the series' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, which shows off the game's unique graphic novel art style and some of its tactical gameplay, right here.</p>




<p>Big Fan and Bithell Games didn't give any reason for the sudden delisting of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, but it's almost certainly got something to do with licensing rights, given that the game is based on an existing property.</p>

<p>If you do want to grab&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>before it's delisted, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1405790/John_Wick_Hex/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/john-wick-hex/9pb1c8s0922m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/john-wick-hex-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as their current-gen successors via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <p>Fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch alert. This one's patch 01.003.200, and it brings the latest in pointy flag tip technology, in addition to another round of weapon balancing. You'll need that flag stabbiness too, as the latest Galactic War twist has seen the Automatons try to wrestle control of Super Earth's space station.</p>
<p>Yep, stop trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">rename a city 'Gun'</a> for five minutes, some stuff's going down in HD2 that you need to be clued in on, even if its just so you can run around the room cheering at how much more effective your Flame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sentry">Sentry</a>'ll now be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As has become the standard for Helldivers 2 updates that pass a certain beefiness threshold, patch 01.003.200 has both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/601909716088521243?l=english">notes</a> and a video explainer that sees design director Niklas Malmborg joined by senior designer Patrik 'Fluffy' Lasorta to talk through the changes.</p>
<p>First of all, the devs have slightly reduced the time it takes your diver to get up after ragdolling, as well as boosting chest injury bleed damage because the latter was previously at a level so low that "it appeared to have no effect". There are also a bunch of tweaks to weapons, mainly aimed at boosting how effective stunning, bayonet-induced stagger, and the firestarting capabilities of stuff like the aforementioned Flame Sentry are.</p>

<p>By far the most important change, however, is the following one to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">Masters of Ceremony warbond</a>'s One True Flag stratagem. "Thanks to some groundbreaking military research into pointier flag tips, the flag can now be proudly planted directly into enemies — dead or alive — ensuring the eternal colors of Super Earth are never tainted, only quenched by the blood of its foes," Arrowhead wrote, with Malmborg adding in the video that "a surprising amount of code" needed messing with to pull this off.</p>
<p>Hellpods and enemies have also undergone some tweaks, but I'm now gonna pivot to something far more urgent. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1394621065032106064">fresh Major Order</a> dropped alongside this patch, and it's seeing the Automatons move to secure sites key to the running of the Democracy Space Station - which the divers have been using to help further Super Earth's goals since late last year.</p>
<p>Claorell, Tarsh, and Gaellivare are the planets folks are being tasked with holding to prevent the DSS being destroyed or falling into enemy hands. Arrowhead also notes that "enemy troop movements indicate this is only the first of several planned waves of attack", meaning "additional invasions are anticipated".</p>
<p>So, it looks like defending the floating hunk of metal is gonna be the next big goal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-lets-you-impale-baddies-with-flags-as-the-bots-take-aim-at-the-democracy-space-station]]></content:encoded>

So while you’ve only a couple of weeks left to finish <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> on your PS4 or PS5, the good news is that you can already move on to <em>Cyberpunk</em>.

Deep Field Games’ paranormal craft-me-do has been phenomenally popular on Steam, boasting the enviable Overwhelmingly Positive rating, with 94 percent of over 32,000 reviews giving it a thumbs up. It’s joined by Don’t Nod’s 2024 story-heavy action-RPG <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, and 2020's super-tough third-person roguelite, <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>. Oh, and Amazon’s <em>New World: Aeternum</em> for some reason.</p><p>But where PlayStation giveth it must also taketh away, so come August you’ll see a bunch of games disappearing. Along with Geralt’s departure there’s also the rather tough loss of the fantastic <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, as well as <em>Wild Hearts </em>(eh), <em>UFC 5</em>, and cutesy creature collector <em>Bugsnax</em>, amongst a bunch of others including six different <em>Sword Art Online</em> games.</p><p>It’s a sad time to see <em>The Witcher 3</em> disappearing, given the game is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-mod-support-ps5-xbox-final-patch-1851783100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-mod-support-ps5-xbox-final-patch-1851783100">soon to be able to support mods on the PlayStation</a></span>, but the ten-year-old title can often be picked up for great prices in sales.</p><p>And while you almost certainly cannot start and finish&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> before it goes, you definitely can complete metroidvania-infused action-adventure&nbsp;<em>Jedi: Survivor</em>.

<header><section>
<p>Though how successful it will be remains to be seen</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95f062d6a1ddf/switch-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has seemingly taken steps to combat so-called 'eSlop' on the Switch 2 – at least in Japan and some regions in Asia.</p>
<p>In a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rolls-out-new-eshop-publishing-guidelines-for-switch-2-in-asia-seemingly-to-curb-spam-games">IGN</a>, Nintendo has implemented new guidelines for publishing on the Switch 2 eShop, most (if not all) of which appear to be targeting the relentless proliferation of low-quality 'eSlop' games. How successful this proves to be remains to be seen in these early days, but it at least sounds like Nintendo is <em>trying</em> to make the eShop a much better experience on Switch 2 than its predecessor.</p>
<p>So what at the guidelines? Well, the first is all about bundles. The new rule states that the maximum number of titles eligible for bundles is five within the first year of a game's release. This number then increases by one for each year the game is available, up to a maximum of eight. This is seemingly targeting a tactic used by some publishers in which constant bundles would be advertised to keep their games near the top of the eShop listings.</p>
<p>The second guideline looks at sensitive content. Nintendo specifically states what would constitute sensitive content, and this includes "sexualization of children, overly sexual content, discrimination and hate, exploitation of social issues, instructing criminal activity, and political statements". The third guideline targets games with inaccurate descriptions, stating "It is prohibited to provide inaccurate descriptions of the contents of a product. It is prohibited to provide description of the content of a product as under development if it is not expected to be implemented in the product".</p>
<p>And finally, Nintendo is prohibiting any drastic changes to a game without due cause, including any title changes and anything that might severely differentiate the title from its presence on other platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, titles found to be violating these guidelines may lead to revisions being requested from Nintendo, or in some cases, a complete refusal to sell the game on the eShop. As we mentioned at the top, it's still early days yet, so it remains to be seen just how successful these guidelines may prove in keeping the 'eSlop' out, but hopefully we'll see a lot more curation on the eShop in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to let you know if and when these guidelines are implemented in the West.</p>

Square Enix has taken an interesting approach to this when it comes to <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</em>: tell everyone tough shit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The forthcoming re-re-re-remake of the first two <em>Dragon Quest</em> games is due October 30, coming to all current consoles and both the Switch and the Switch 2. Square Enix has made it clear that the Switch 2 version will take advantage of the brand new console’s more advanced tech, explaining this distinction by saying “each version has a different graphical specification based on the hardware’s processing capabilities.” The publisher goes on to point out that beyond this, there are no differences to what’s actually <em>in</em> the game, whether that’s story or in-game items. OK, that all makes sense.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq1and2/faq/en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq1and2/faq/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new FAQ on the Japanese site for the series</a></span> then breaks down potential confusion over compatibility: the Switch 1 version will work on the Switch 2, but the Switch 2 version won’t work on the Switch 1 (perfectly normal, but underlined by the Switch 2 build coming with an empty cart). Further, playing the Switch 1 version on the Switch 2 won’t unlock its improved version, but rather run exactly the same as it would on the original console. Right, that sucks, but sure. So, given all this, what’s the option for people who buy the Switch 1 cart, but then get a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the improved graphics in the game? Um, the option is to spend another $60 and buy the whole game over again.</p><p>“Can copies of the Switch version of DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake be upgraded to the Switch 2 version?” the FAQ asks itself, rather tellingly acknowledging the frequency with which such a question will be asked. “No,” it replies to itself, “there is no upgrade path currently available or planned. Please buy your copy for whichever system you would like to play it on.”</p><p>Clearly any publisher can do whatever it wants. What Square apparently wants is to roll its eyes and flip a finger at anyone who might upgrade from their current console to the new one at any point after they’ve bought this game. And it’s that peculiarly forthright attitude of, “Just buy the right version,” in the FAQ that makes it much harder to swallow.</p><p>It’s not exactly an inconceivable situation that a Switch 1 owner might buy this remake of the classic 1986 <em>Dragon Warrior </em>and its 1987 sequel in October this year, and then a couple of months later, under their Christmas tree, discover a shiny new Switch 2. Now, the “copy for whichever system you would like to play it on” has rather dramatically changed. That person might, quite reasonably, assume there would be a way to upgrade their version of the game for this new device, and they wouldn’t be wildly out of order to think they might be allowed to do that for free. At the very worst, for something like a $10 fee, as outrageous as that would be given both the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game cost exactly the same.</p><p>It’s worth noting that saves won’t be able to transfer between the two versions, either, suggesting these are two incompatible versions of the same game.</p><p>So, should you be one of the the very many people who will be in this situation or one like it, Squeenix’s expectation is that you just spend another $60 on a game you already bought. Obviously, most people will just play the crappier Switch 1 version on their Switch 2 and take their lumps, making it even harder to see why the Japanese publisher would take such a bizarre  path. Just let people upgrade their copy, Square! What’s going on here?</p><p>We’ve reached out to Square Enix to try to understand the thinking behind this decision, and will update this article should we find out.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-square-enix-switch-2-upgrade-1851786270]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI development seems to be proceeding well, so much so that the expectations of the game appearing during this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase weren't just speculation, but an educated guess.</p>



<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDr2ZSFIEXk&amp;t=4105s">XB2 podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden commented on the sixth entry in the series, saying that it is in a "quite playable" state, without providing any additional information, and that the game's current state is the reason why the game could have been expected to be shown at this year's Xbox Games Showcase. Unfortunately, the game's release window remains unknown, as Corden has no idea how far along the game is, as finding sources inside Bethesda is difficult.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it has been a long time since the release of the fifth entry in the series, fans of the Bethesda series can make the wait for The Elder Scrolls VI more bearable by returning to Cyrondiil with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The remaster uses Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the game's original engine for gameplay, offering an experience that is extremely faithful to the original while updating it where needed. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>

Now, the union that represents a number of devs left in limbo by that game's canning have issued an update about the process of fighting for their futures.</p>
<p>ZOS' MMO, codenamed Project Blackbird, wasn't the only game Microsoft pulled the plug on as they let go of around 9k people. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Rare's Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot were also wiped out, with the latter studio being shuttered to boot.</p>

<p>"Earlier this month, Microsoft indefinitely shelved an unannounced MMORPG at ZeniMax Online Studios, a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on the project," wrote ZeniMax Online Studios United (ZOSU), not to be confused with similarly named union ZeniMax Workers United. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">The former</a> represents web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists who were working on ESO and this unannounced MMO, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">the latter</a> is focused on QA staff.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, a future has been stolen from many of us and our community will never experience an amazing game," they continued, "However, despite discussions regarding the status of our employment, the fact is: we have not yet been laid off."</p>

</span></p><p>The current state of play the union outline is that their "worker-volunteers" are busy bargaining with Microsoft on behalf of those affected members.</p>
<p>"Where Microsoft has failed to support the talented craftspeople who have generated billions in revenue, our union has stepped up to provide clarity and support," they wrote. "It is true that a layoff may be in the future for some of our members. However, as a result of our organising, we are able to ensure that those impacted will be able to depart with dignity."</p>
<p>While being able to "depart with dignity" potentially being the best outcome some of these devs can hope for doesn't sound all that comforting, one can only imagine how much worse a situation these devs might be in without something in place to help fight their case.</p>

            <p>Octopath Traveller co-developer Acquire is working on three new original games, in a new deal with Middle Eastern publisher Red Dunes Games.</p>
<p>Acquire (owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>) is best known for the likes of Tenchu and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a>, as well as supporting Nintendo's RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> and co-developing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Octopath Traveller games.</p>
<p>The three original games in development will be shown at this year's Tokyo Game Show in September, as reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2025/07/14/tenchu-studio-acquire-and-red-dunes-games-unveil-global-co-dev-deal/">Forbes</a>, and will be released on PC and major consoles. The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Tremor (featuring "city-shaking kaiju battles")</li>
<li>Project Umbra ("dark fantasy hunts")</li>
<li>Project Shadowcar ("a shadowy espionage thriller")</li>

<p>"As Acquire, a studio that has long valued originality from Japan in game development, we are thrilled to have found a wonderful partner in Red Dunes Games and embark on a bold new global challenge together," said CEO Takuma Endo.</p>
<p>"We've always believed in the power of originality. Now, with Red Dunes, we're building something truly international."</p>
<p>Red Dunes Games, based in Abu Dhabi, has until now focused on indie games, but is looking to expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>"Acquire is a legendary studio with a deep creative legacy, and we are honoured to work with them to build the next wave of original games," said Sultan Darmaki, CEO and creative director. "This partnership is a reflection of our belief that the future of gaming lies in global collaboration, where stories cross borders, and innovation knows no region."</p>
<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership released last year. "A relatively minor instalment, but in a series this magical, that's still good news," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">our review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveller-co-developer-working-on-three-new-original-games-coming-to-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">John Wick Hex</a>, a wonderful tactical RPG, is being delisted off digital storefronts on the 17th July.</p>
<p>Developed by Bithell Games and released back in 2019, it will still be playable by those who already own the game. But after the cutoff date on the 17th, those interested in the game will no longer be able to buy it on Steam, GOG, or other platforms. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEg20P">You can still grab it now on Humble</a> for a fraction of its standard price.</p>
<p>A statement released by the publisher Big Fan Games reads as follows: "After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Console) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront."</p>

<p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-wick-hex-review-sweet-economy">reviewed John Wick Hex favourably</a>, as Donlan wrote: "There is a great game lurking in John Wick. This series is so infused with the spirit of games, its world-building is so gamey, how could there not be? I'm still not sure that John Wick Hex is actually that precise game, but who cares when it's pretty great in its own right?"</p>
<p>The story of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-john-wick-hex-ended-up-a-strategy-game-instead-of-a-shooter">how it turned out to be a strategy game rather than a shooter like you'd expect</a> is also interesting, with developer Mike Bithell stating: "I wanted to give players that sense of strategic thinking, that high-level choreography. Then came the process of making that, pitching that, working with them, and then getting all of the filmmakers from the movies involved. They were telling me how John makes decisions, and then we went 'OK how do we make that into a game that explores that', and that to me seemed way more interesting than doing a shooter."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-excellent-john-wick-hex-will-be-delisted-later-this-week-currently-on-sale]]></content:encoded>

Many such horses. You play as Kofun, a boy shaped like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun">keyhole tomb</a> who is also sort of an actual keyhole tomb but also a boy who wants to fulfill his destiny <em>as</em> a keyhole tomb, namely by finding a dead body to bury inside of himself. He lives in a park with his mate Haniwa, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haniwa">Haniwa</a>. Haniwa's secret is that he's very good at calligraphy. Here's some visual orientation in case you're not caught up yet.</p>

<p>It's from Cavyhouse, whose previous offering was “dungeon agriculturalization roguelite game” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1396980/The_Sealed_Ampoule">The Sealed Ampoule</a>. The demo itself is a little too short to get a good feel for things, but if it's at all representative, the game is primarily about hanging out with good weirdos and poking objects.</p>
<p>You hang about in the park Kofun and Hanawa live in. You slide down a slide. Swing on a swing. Swing on a bar, an annoying object for its refusal to bend to the verb-noun symmetry found elsewhere. You collect points for doing all this, then spend them on pondering various objects. I very much enjoy the idea of a <em>pondering currency</em>, both conceptually and in practise. It's all suitably whimsical but then Kofun will occasionally gesture at the fact that he is, undoubtedly, a tomb. I am nothing if not curious to see where this all goes. <a href="https://www.artribune.com/progettazione/2025/07/anticipazioni-videogiochi/">Cheers to The Attribune</a> for the spot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finally-a-game-about-a-boy-who-thinks-hes-a-tomb-searching-for-a-dead-body-to-bury-inside-of-him]]></content:encoded>

"Two and a half years after the acquisition, the Madrid studio has not received a single contract from Testronic. The employees suspect that the initial intention was to drain the studio of its content and offshore the work. Along with CSVI and CGT union, the workers believe may be no valid reason for the redundancy plan."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-star-wars-battlefront-2-player-surge-exposes-a-major-flaw-in-ea-s-business-model" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Star Wars Battlefront II player surge exposes the flaws in EA's business model</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid and CGT allege that Testronic wants to shutter the studio so it can focus on Secret 6 Manila, where they claim working conditions are "much more precarious and wages much lower." Those factors, they say, will enable Testronic to commit "more unchecked labor exploitation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As soon as the Madrid studio was acquired, the new leadership failed to take on the necessary responsibilities and tasks for client acquisition, a role that had been effectively managed by the previous CEO, who was dismissed after fulfilling his sales contract," continues the release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Secret 6 Madrid is dedicated exclusively to art development for video games and lacks a department for actively seeking new clients, as it was assured that this responsibility would fall entirely on Testronic and its sales department. In this way, the Madrid studio was left to survive solely on the contracts it had maintained due to its strong reputation with previous clients.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ousted Unknown Worlds founders, former CEO sue Krafton for breach of contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Given these circumstances, the managers of the Madrid studio tried to coordinate with Testronic's sales team to develop joint strategies that could bring new contracts to the studio. The proposed meetings never took place, and the email exchanges on this matter led nowhere; on several occasions, there was no response from Testronic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the face of those issues, Secret 6 Madrid's management team claims it actively sought to attend industry events and contact studios directly to secure contracts and in turn their future. Testronic allegedly refused those requests and even prohibited Secret 6 from directly contacting potential clients.&nbsp; What's more, the Madrid team alleges that only Secret 6 representatives from Manila were allowed to travel to events, leaving them unable to effectively promote their arm of the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the press release, Testronic also told the Madrid team to raise their fees to increase profit margins "despite repeated warnings from the Madrid managers that this decision would harm the studio and could lead to the loss of contracts—something that, in fact, occurred with two clients the studio had been collaborating with for several years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Testronic's response was that if the clients did not agree to these price hikes, the contracts should be terminated immediately, even if this meant not having other projects for the Madrid studio to work on. These price increases were entirely unrealistic and risky, given the current state of the video game market, which is why workers and unions consider it to have been a 'suicidal decision' in every sense."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/exploring-sabotage-studio-s-strategy-for-balancing-creativity-and-sustainability-game-developer-podcast-ep-50" target="_self" data-discover="true">Exploring Sabotage Studio's strategy for balancing creativity and sustainability - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 50</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid claims it proved to be "financially solvent" in terms of production capacity and earnings despite those challenges, and suggests it has a number of clients who wish to continue providing the studio with work.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it&quot;">"I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Four members of the Secret 6 Madrid team, including two studio managers, have now spoken to Game Developer to discuss the impact of their fight against their parent company. All four sources chose to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, but explain how Testronic effectively abandoned Secret 6 Madrid as soon as it was acquired by the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From day one it was quite clear what sort of intentions they had," said one source. "It's that they wanted [to expand their] presence in the Asian market. [...] That's the reason we were feeling a little bit afraid, because we could see that our offices in Manila were more attractive to them than us—even when the strong arm [of the business] is here in Madrid."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say Testronic's treatment of Secret 6 Madrid is like purchasing a plant and then refusing to water it, and emphasize that the only person at the company who was searching for new contracts under the Testronic banner was their former CEO. We're told how Secret 6 Madrid has received very little support or contact from their parent company, but that their first meeting with a Testronic sales exec made it clear they were "selling smoke" and had no intention of nurturing the Madrid studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, multiple sources claim that when Testronic did eventually hire a sales person to assist the studio, they brought in someone who "didn't know the difference between 3D and 2D art." Given Secret 6 Madrid specializes in art outsourcing, it was a confusing decision that left the studio high and dry. "They couldn't sell art, basically." adds another source. "But that's what they told us: 'hey, you've got this person in case you want to use them.' But they didn't do anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source claims that, the day after Testronic told staff Secret 6 Madrid would be closed, the studio was approached by a client who wanted to sign a contract worth a purported €800,000, but that Testronic remained entirely focused on dismantling the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing those aforementioned price hikes, one person says that Testronic didn't advise the Madrid office to raise its prices but rather mandated the move. There was no room for discussion or compromise. "[We were told] 'you are going to raise the rates for every single client by at least 15 percent, and if they say no you are going to stop working for them immediately.' This is not a real strategy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source describes that approach was like being forced to play poker without the ability to do anything but go all in on each hand. "It was really, really dangerous for us," they add, noting that relationships with some clients turned sour as a result.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has culminated in a dire situation that has left Secret 6 Madrid workers fighting for their livelihoods. In an ideal world, the team want to continue developing video games under the Secret 6 banner—but given the precarious situation they have been placed in are also attempting to secure solid severance packages in tandem with CGT.&nbsp;Right now, they haven't ruled out striking if discussions stall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The first thing we want is to continue doing our labor. To continue being able to create games, and to continue having this amazing team of people creating games in the future," adds one source. "They don't want to let us continue—and they are saying 'no, we are going to close you down."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another employee agrees and says Testronic has never made a "serious" proposal that will enable the team to continue working. All four explain that watching Testronic slowly put their studio to the sword over the course of years has massively impacted their wellbeing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For me personally it has been awful," says one person. "You could actually see that we were running out of projects for a long time and we couldn't do anything. [...] It has been exhausting, because at some point we realized that we were trying to save something that someone else had decided should be left to die. That was very hard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I feel like they took the opportunity for us to be able to keep growing as a team, and that really hurts because there are exceptional people here with a lot of talent and we are very close as a team. I admire every single person here that's in the office and all of our colleagues that are online, and they are great. The humanity that's here is exceptional."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source feels Secret 6 Madrid wouldn't be facing closure if Testronic had "wanted to do their job" and claims that lives are being upended because their parent company has abandoned their responsibilities. Such is the feeling of injustice at the decision to shutter Secret 6 Madrid that at least one member of the team has traveled from another region in Spain to Madrid "to fight and sit on the negotiation table."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it," they say. That passion is evident no matter who speaks up—although one source explains their frustration has now turned to anger. "They tried to choke us from the start of this whole process—and this is very very frustrating," they add. "[I'm feeling] both stress and fear. A mixture of emotions and feelings, but most of it is rage. We are raging about this whole redundancy process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The real kicker, according to one person, is that Testronic "will most likely get away with it." As is so often the case when major conglomerates and corporations make sweeping cuts in the name of sustainability, growth, or whatever other buzzword they roll out to appease investors, the executives making those decisions are left unscathed and often escape accountability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of Testronic, we have reached out multiple times to the company since word of the closure began spreading on social media. So far, we haven't heard back. One source explains they "would love" to hear what the company has to say publicly on the matter—not least because it seems the firm has been decidedly unresponsive when discussing the situation internally.&nbsp;"To be honest, I think they know what they have been doing is wrong," they add. "[But] it's quite clear they don't want to talk."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has once again reached out to Testronic for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

		<p>Publisher Big Fan Games has announced that John Wick Hex is going to be delisted from all platforms on July 17th, but a reason behind this delisting was not given. In a statement, Big Fan Games did state that anyone who has a digital copy of the game already on any platform will still be able to play John Wick Hex after the game is delisted, and physical copies of the game will not be impacted either.</p>

<p>The full statement about the John Wick Hex delisting from Big Fan Games reads, <em>“John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025.After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Console) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront.”</em></p>
<p>John Wick Hex was developed by Bithell Games, with Mike Bithell taking to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3ltxcisuy2c22">BlueSky</a> to give his own thoughts on the delisting, but he has not been able to give the reason for the delisting. He said, <em>“Pour one out (and pick up a copy asap if you want one). This one was a weird journey.. initially polarised folks, but now it’s one of the consistent favourites people wanna chat with me about when I’m doing public stuff. My first disappeared game, a weird feeling. It’s legacy will be that you can watch me getting my arse kicked on the John Wick 3 special features by the eventual director of Love Hurts. My pink face will echo through eternity.”</em></p>

<p>In our John Wick Hex review, Miguel said, <em>“John Wick Hex is the last form you might expect a John Wick game to take, but this unique, inventive puzzler kept my mind racing from beginning to end. While the gameplay and interesting story shed light on some important aspects of the film franchise, the sometimes punishing difficulty and surprising lack of focus on John Wick himself left me a little disappointed. This isn’t a perfect video game adaptation of a film, but it’s certainly the most original one I’ve ever played.”</em></p>

<p>Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> is due out on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, and ahead of release, an official FAQ has shared an important detail.</p>
<p>It's been confirmed there's no upgrade path currently available or planned, so if you want to play it on a particular platform, you'll need to buy it on that system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can copies of the Switch version of DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake be upgraded to the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no upgrade path currently available or planned. Please buy your copy for whichever system you would like to play it on.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vnogpq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the text of the image above, it's mentioned how the Switch version "cannot be upgraded" and there are "no plans for such an upgrade path in the future". Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes for the game can only be used with the Switch 2 version (and vice versa with the Switch release and codes).</p>
<p>So, there you go – if you are buying the game on the Switch with hopes of upgrading it at some point, now you know you can't do that. And keep in mind a 'Game-Key Card' release for the Switch 2 version has also been confirmed.</p>
