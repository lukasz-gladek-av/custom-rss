  <p id="9Y8409"><em>The Sympathizer</em> is full of twists and turns — and why wouldn’t it be? It’s a show (based on a book of the same name by Viet Thanh Nguyen) that follows a Viet Cong double agent from the end of the Vietnam War to life as a refugee in America as he works to secure the Viet Cong’s victory. All the while, the show wrestles with themes of self and identity, as filtered through The Captain (Hoa Xuande), said double agent; his Vietnamese community in 1970s Los Angeles; and the variety of white men he works for (all played by Robert Downey Jr.). </p>
<p id="PUPIe6">In the final episode, we finally catch up with The Captain’s present-day story in a reeducation camp in Vietnam, led by the shadowy Commissar, who’s been demanding the Captain’s story be written out in exacting detail. It’s no surprise that the true name of the Commissar — another figure defined by his title more than himself<strong> </strong>— would be another surprise in the plot. But, like any unveiling of true identity in <em>The Sympathizer</em>, it’s more a twist of the knife than anything else. </p>

<p id="jltha1">In the final episode, the Captain finds out the Commissar is in fact his friend Mẫn, now scarred from napalm strikes during the fall of Saigon. Worse yet, this old friend/prison camp supervisor<strong> </strong>is <em>still</em> going to torture him for information. </p>
<p id="9YRsQi">It’s a tough way for the Captain to find out that his visions of Mẫn — alone in an office and highly decorated, leading the bright future for Vietnam — weren’t accurate. Throughout the show, the Captain’s reflections were a neat framing device and something he saw as mostly a formality, the one thing standing between him and the bright future of Communist Vietnam he had fought so hard for. Now, staring him in the face, is the cold reality of what his struggle has culminated in. It’s all in keeping with the way <em>The Sympathizer</em> has been using the Captain’s imaginative visions as specters of his subjective (and warped) point of view.</p>
<p id="H3RxPJ">“The ghosts really pertain to his consciousness, his conscience about his actions,” Xuande told Polygon. “The Captain’s journey is really about trying to survive, trying to weave his way out, and trying to never be found out, and, obviously, toeing the line between his allegiances.”</p>
<p id="9qjIGv">In that light, his vision with Mẫn isn’t all that different from his visions of Sonny or the Major; they’re all, as Xuande puts it, an expression of “the trauma that he’s been hiding from.” They’re a startling way for the Captain to realize that his actions have been more about finding any means to survive than about following his communist ideals, or fighting for a better Vietnam.</p>
<p id="ptfQUT">“When they come back to haunt and remind him about the very things he’s been neglecting in his memory, it’s a reminder for him that everything that he believes and thought he was doing for the cause might not actually be right.” </p>
<p id="R3QYHs">This is an idea that <em>The Sympathizer</em> underlines again and again with the Captain’s character: Nothing about his life is straightforward or neat, and none of it went the way he planned. Even as he seems to confess to Sonny or carry out the general’s orders to kill him, the Captain is acting for his own reasons, rather than purely “the cause.” </p>

</p>
<p id="YSDc1V">Such corruption of idealistic impulses is something Mẫn also knows all too well, seemingly disillusioned with the state of the country at the same time he does his job. He is, as his dual character names speak to, a different person now, much harder than he was as a spy under American imperialism. But (much like Downey Jr.’s parade of white authority figures) Duy Nguyễn wanted to make sure you could see the connective tissue between every version of Mẫn.</p>
<p id="UyLftz">“To develop this character, I had to really dig deep: What is Mẫn? How does he talk? How does he move? How does he act around his friend, or does he act alone with just the Captain?” Nguyễn says. “He’s the dentist, so he’s very still; he has to be precise. And he’s intellectual, so he has to stay upright. The way he talks is clear — so those are the parts I keep.</p>
<p id="5mUjVW">“[In episode 7], he is so damaged, but he still wants to keep the presence in front of his friends. He just wants to try to be the same person his friend saw the last time.” </p>
<p id="q9Hjqo">Which is crucial; all of episode 7 — and the crux of <em>The Sympathizer</em>’s final turn — comes down to how Mẫn’s turn plays. He is the single person, the crucial vector point, around which the Captain’s story gets suddenly jerked back, calling his bluffs and calling out all his perspective gaps. Like the Captain, he is a study of dualities: a person and a rank; loyal to the cause, yet wary; a ghost from the past and a vision of the brave new fractured and corrupted world. After filtering so much of the narrative — and, with it, the war, its aftershocks, and all the complexities contained within those — through the Captain’s identity, Mẫn is the only one who can match and cut through the noise of the story the Captain has been telling himself. </p>
<p id="Gf9zGw">And the truth is at once infinitely more complex and far simpler than he was prepared to believe. Through his torture, the Captain finally reconciles with some of the worst things he did for the war, going all the way back to one of the earliest scenes of the show (that we now know was actually the rape of a fellow Communist agent). He has to accept who he is and where he comes from. And he has to accept that nothing about his trauma and suffering has necessarily fixed his nation. All that hardship might’ve just borne more pain — or, worse, indifference to pain. As the sexually assaulted Communist agent tells him, after all her years in the war and the camp, “nothing can disappoint” her now. </p>
<p id="xXblq9">In the end, it’s Mẫn who gets the Captain (and Bon) free of the camp, back on a boat headed for the ol’ U.S. of A. It once again makes him a study in conflict; after so many years of loving (and trying to hate) that place, it might be his salvation after all. As the Captain looks back on Vietnam, he now sees a nation of ghosts — more clearly than ever. </p>

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The second season of<em> My Adventures with Superman</em>, an animated retelling of the Man of Steel’s early heroics, has finally arrived. </p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">Season one ended on a few cliffhangers, so here’s everything you need to know about season two’s release schedule so you can watch its episodes as they come out.</p> <h2 id="h-my-adventures-with-superman-episode-release-schedule" data-injectable="false">My Adventures with Superman episode release schedule</h2> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">New episodes of <em>My Adventures with Superman</em> season two will air on Adult Swim at 12:00 A.M. ET, aka midnight. In an improvement from its predecessor, this season’s episodes will be the first show to air on Adult Swim’s iconic Toonami block. The first two episodes of the season aired back to back on May 26, but the rest of season two’s episodes will air individually. We already know the names of six of season two’s ten episodes, and they’re listed in the release schedule below.</p>

Episodes of season one were uploaded to HBO Max after they premiered on Adult Swim. While the first episodes of season two are not on the streaming service as of this writing, it probably won’t be long before they make their way onto the show’s HBO Max page.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-my-adventures-with-superman-season-two-about" data-injectable="false">What is My Adventures with Superman season two about?</h2> <figure data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="My Adventures with Superman | SEASON 2 TRAILER | adult swim" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8Ihhvbr2aA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><em>My Adventures with Superman</em>‘s first season followed the beginning of Clark Kent’s career as both a reporter at the Daily Planet and as Superman, focusing primarily on his budding relationship with Lois Lane. As the series progressed, Clark, Lois, and Jimmy Olson found themselves entangled in the machinations of Task Force X, an anti-alien government task force helmed by Amanda Waller and the mysterious “General.”</p>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">The final episodes of season one were packed with several shocking relations, the most notable being that the General was Lois’ estranged father, Samuel Lane, and that Superman’s homeworld of Krypton had launched a failed invasion of Earth shortly before Clark’s arrival on the Kent family farm.</p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="false">If season two’s episode titles are anything to go by, its story will focus on the fallout of these revelations and their impact on Clark and Lois’ relationship. With Sam on the outs with an increasingly militant Task Force X and the post-credits scene of season one’s finale teasing the arrival of legacy Superman villains Brainiac and General Zod, it’s clear that season two’s stakes will be even higher than season one’s.</p>

<p data-characters="371" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As we ramp up toward the launch of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em>, Bungie has been releasing ViDocs detailing the development of the last major expansion in the game’s current story arc. While these look at every aspect of the game’s new content, it’s the design for its location, the heart of the Traveler, The Pale Heart, that’s piqued my interest. </p> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">In <em>The Final Shape</em>, Guardians will travel into the Traveler to battle The Witness and prevent it from doing what it’s been trying to wreak havoc on the universe, as it’s been trying to do ever since <em>Destiny</em> was initially released. In The Pale Heart, we’ll find a world that’s forged from our memories and its. As a result, it’s the strangest place I’ve ever seen in the franchise. </p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">In their efforts to make The Pale Heart as strange as <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s story requires it to be, Bungie has inadvertently created a location that would look right at home in <em>Warframe</em>. As someone who is currently rolling through the story missions for <em>Warframe</em> but also has hundreds of hours in <em>Destiny 2</em>, I think this location looks like a real treat. </p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Becoming Legend - Part 1: Confronting Oblivion" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nvU01d_gh0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">Lead Concept Artist for <em>The Final Shape</em>, Gabriel Garza, explains in the first ViDoc how the vision for The Pale Heart was to make it feel surreal. The team achieved this by using objects that are normal, everyday ordinary to us, and placing them in unexpected places. The term he uses is “shire-to-spire,” which, to me, feels like a blend of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">One of the best surreal shots is of a room with pillars detailed with hands and faces. As I play more and more of <em>Warframe</em>, I find the faces of the Grineer enemies, particularly those with shoulders that are just a bit too high, quite unnerving. The faces in the shot above give me that same feeling. It’s very reminiscent of Han Solo’s body frozen in Carbonite, his face strained in pain and always seeming to try to burst out of the hardened shell. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Another outstanding example of the strangeness in The Pale Heart is this house with The Witness’s ever-trailing headdress coming out of the chimney. This reminds me a lot of the house in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-returnal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal</a></em> that you could stumble upon at any point, and it’s much more terrifying because it’s so totally out of place. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Maybe the best shot that directly translates to <em>Warframe</em>, though, is this one of a large Ghost stuck in a rocky outcrop. The poor machine that’s usually so full of life and floating around to try to protect its Guardian is instead a statue in death for all to see. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">This image juxtaposes the giant humanoid in <em>Warframe</em>‘s <em>Whispers in the Walls</em> questline. In that story, players discover a giant humanoid, an unfinished project that is very much aware of its surroundings and moves and responds to you. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">The Pale Heart’s dead Ghost is no less unnerving because it’s more a part of the scenery. What it shows is that the location is struggling to reconcile what it should be. On one hand, it wants to be a Ghost that is helpful to Guardians. On the other, it wants to be a lush, vibrant world and not the frozen wasteland The Witness desires, hence its overall strangeness. </p> <figure data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The image that really cements just how unsettling The Pale Heart really is, though, is the concept art of a giant, hellish Ghost on the horizon. It’s as if the brightest source of light and reassurance in <em>Destiny 2</em> has been rendered a demon and grown to immense proportions, so there’s no possible way we could beat it. </p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">This image also details Russia, the first point in <em>Destiny</em> where every player begins their journey. It leads into the distance up to this demonic Ghost. It’s almost like the world is actively hostile to us and wants to hurt us. Of course, that is the influence of The Witness and shows how everything we know can be twisted to work against us. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">The last example I want to use takes us back to hands. Bungie has made tree hands in The Pale Heart, and they’re the creepiest thing you could ever hope to see in a landscape as you venture forth to battle the forces of darkness. I don’t think it’s hands that are necessarily the creepy thing here, but I know that growing body parts is a basic part of nature. </p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">While <em>Warframe</em> isn’t a horror game, I feel a lot of body horror when looking at some of its characters. Faces on machines or places you don’t expect them, and machines resembling humans moving in ways that almost make me feel sick. Most of these characters and enemies are genuinely fantastic, and I love speaking to and fighting them because of that blend of organic, inorganic, and immensely strange they bring to the table. </p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2</em> has always felt very sleek and futuristic to me. Even its version of strange has always been beautiful in a way, whether it’s a Hive nest, a Fallen ship, or Mars covered in sludge as its ice caps melt. The Pale Heart is the first time I’ve seen Bungie truly embrace the strange and create environments that might make you feel a bit icky or even violated as you explore. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="false">I can’t wait to jump into this new world and uncover all its creepy secrets. Like Caonpic Jars tucked away out of sight, I’m sure the unsettling elements of The Pale Heart will maintain the sense of dread you feel when your sixth sense tells you something isn’t quite right about the environment you find yourself in. </p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer PopCap and publisher EA have been working on the latest entry in the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plants Vs. Zombies</a></em> series, <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia</em>, for the past four years or so. It’s been through a few soft launches and periods of unavailability, but it’s still very much in development. </p> <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">However, alongside this work on the third tower defense title in the series, a group of fans have been working on a game called <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em>. It was announced as being in development on May 1, 2024, but it didn’t even last the rest of the month before EA and PopCap stepped in to put a stop to it. The thing is, neither company seems to have been that harsh with the fans, yet despite this game clearly infringing the franchise’s copyright, the fan developers are crushed by their game’s cancelation. </p>
 <h2 id="h-why-was-plants-vs-zombies-3-what-could-have-been-shut-down" data-injectable="false">Why was <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> shut down?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">The reason that <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> was shut down is because it heavily infringes the PopCap and EA’s copyright for not only <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia</em>, but also the series as a whole. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">The game may be a fan project, but it’s set in the universe PopCap created, uses the company’s characters, the design for the games that sparked the series, and everything else that makes up the essence of the series. On May 14, 2024, the creators of <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> <a href="https://x.com/PvZ3_WCHB/status/1794523282068390099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received communication</a> from PopCap and EA asking them to stop development. </p> <figure data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">— Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been (@PvZ3_WCHB) <a href="https://twitter.com/PvZ3_WCHB/status/1794523282068390099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">The direct communication asked the project’s founder to stop development because it’s an alternative version of PopCap and EA’s game. The message, sent via Reddit, explained how PopCap is generally okay with fan projects but has to draw the line somewhere. The line, it turns out, is drawn at creating alternative versions of <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> games. </p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="true">The fans understood where PopCap was coming from but felt this reaction was pretty rash. At the time the message was received, only the artwork for <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> had been released publicly. However, as user <a href="https://x.com/chhopsky/status/1794725022407536661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chhopsky</a> points out on Twitter, it looks a lot like someone cut out the tagline for PopCap’s game and stuck their own in its place. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>i genuinely do not even know where to begin roasting this</p><p>you announced you were making a numbered sequel in a series you don't own</p><p>why didn't photoshopping the TRADEMARK SYMBOL out of the art you stole make you think 'hmm maybe i might be violating something, but what?' <a href="https://t.co/HvfJeGykJM">https://t.co/HvfJeGykJM</a> <a href="https://t.co/fxBS9Hmhid">pic.twitter.com/fxBS9Hmhid</a></p></div>— christina 死神 (@chhopsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/chhopsky/status/1794725022407536661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="771" data-injectable="true">In their response to PopCap, the founder of the fan project made it clear they didn’t want this game to be an “alternative” to PopCap’s. In fact, they outlined how the image they’d shared was temporary, and the game they wanted to make would use original artwork, sprites, and music and have its own storyline. Furthermore, the game wouldn’t be monetized in any way or listed in the same market space as PopCap’s original title. </p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">PopCap’s response to this was, I think, pretty reasonable. It explained how the fan project couldn’t use any of the original characters it had created, such as PeaShooter, Sunflower, Wall-nut, Conehead Zombie, and every other face you see in the official series. There would be trouble if the fan project contained redrawn versions of these characters. </p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">However, PopCap is very clear that if <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> contains all-new characters created specifically for its setting and story, that wouldn’t be an issue. Its response is actually pretty encouraging on that front. </p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">The founder’s takeaway was that PopCap was singling the game out and that making original characters to fill in for those the developer had made in the first place wasn’t worth it. Considering the amount of work it would take to make meaningfully different stand-ins, I have to agree. But it’s hard to say how others would have felt about this, given that the game was meant to be the product of passionate fans who just wanted to make a game they were desperate for in the franchise. </p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">Understandably, the founder hasn’t gone into too much detail about what the plan for <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> is moving forward. The group certainly can’t make the game now, but there is a choice to be made between continuing it in secret and distributing it quietly or, given PopCaps’ requirements, just making a full alternative to<em> Plants vs. Zombies</em>. </p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">I would absolutely love to see a passionate group of fans of this series, which was one of the first to really make a splash on smartphones back in the day, make something they feel is better and serves the needs of the players. After all, as the <a href="https://x.com/PvZ3_WCHB/status/1794523313899000314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder points out in their thread</a>, there’s some contradiction between what PopCap said to them about protecting the work of its artists and EA’s intention of using generative AI to replace them. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What was <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> was a fan project created to address two major problems with <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em> that EA and PopCap made. First, the official game seemed to be in a bit of a development hell for several years. It initially soft-launched to a set number of users before being taken down. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Then, it was restored in certain regions and taken down again. It only officially launched in 2024, but it was still a soft launch. The fan project basically aimed to be a full game for fans to enjoy, not one that would appear and disappear for even longer. </p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">The second issue that <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> was built to fix was fans’ unaddressed expectations of gameplay. The <a href="https://pvzcc.fandom.com/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_3:_What_Could_Have_Been" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project’s website</a> doesn’t specify exactly what these are, but I imagine these gripes must have been present in both previous titles to warrant a group of fans getting together to fix them in a new game. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">It certainly looks like the team had some huge plans for <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> and always made it clear that it couldn’t monetize it, so it would be free for anyone who wanted it. That doesn’t change the fact that the game uses assets created by PopCap and EA.</p> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="false">If the project’s creators had stayed quiet about their game and distributed it to friends and fans, it might have seen the light of day. As it stands, this fan game made it to 23 days in active development and even had applications for more people to join in that time. Thankfully, no legal action appears to have been taken, so no one is losing money or suffering that much over it. </p>

					<p>The collaboration that would bring to Star Wars Outlaws was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-lucasfilm-new-star-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in January 2021, when Lucasfilm Games revealed it had partnered with Ubisoft Massive (Tom Clancy's The Division) to make an open-world game based on George Lucas's beloved sci-fi universe.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-ubisoft-massive-early-states-the-division-2-support-into-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> investors the project was still in the early stages of development. Indeed, in early 2022, leaker Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-ubisoft-massive-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believed</a> the game wouldn't be released until 2025. However, in late 2022, Ubisoft Massive was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-massive-entertainment-playtesting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking for playtesters</a> in the area around Malmö, and in early 2023, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-open-world-game-news-teased-by-ubisoft-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> big incoming news on the project. Ahead of the Summer 2023 events, Kotaku <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-open-world-star-wars-game-to-arrive-in-early-2024-kotaku-sources-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a rumor that the game would actually be released in early 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_DiscoveraGalaxyofOpportunity-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Release date, platforms, pricing, editions</h2>
<p>The official unveiling of Star Wars Outlaws occurred during Summer Game Fest, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed a brief trailer</a>. However, the real stunner came with the Ubisoft Forward keynote, when the developers debuted <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-first-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an impressive gameplay demo</a> that showed a combination of tight third-person combat, big open world vistas, and seamless planet-to-space transitions.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws was immediately set for a 2024 release window, although it was likely originally planned for a Q1 launch, as previously reported by Kotaku. However, in October 2023, Ubisoft practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-moves-star-wars-outlaws-to-next-fiscal-year-delays-skull-and-bones-to-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a small delay into the next fiscal year and out of Q1.</p>
<p>Following a series of ratings from various boards, Star Wars Outlaws finally received <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-is-out-on-august-30-pre-orders-are-now-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its August 30 launch date</a> in early April, which is also when pre-orders opened on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>All editions of the game, including the Standard one priced at $69.99, will receive the Kessel Runner Bonus Pack, which includes cosmetic packs for your speeder and starship. The Gold Edition, priced at $109.99, adds three days of early access, the Season Pass with two post-launch DLCs that will introduce all-new stories, quests, and areas to discover, as well as the exclusive Jabba's Gambit mission and the Kessel Runner Character Pack with cosmetics for Kay and Nix. Lastly, the Ultimate Edition ($129.99) adds the Rogue Infiltrator Bundle (cosmetics for Kay, Nix, her speeder, and the spaceship), the Sabacc Shark Bundle (cosmetics for Kay, her blaster, Nix, the speeder, and the spaceship), and a digital artbook featuring a selection of the game's concept art and visuals and unique cinematic storyboards.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated game will also be playable on day one with the Ubisoft+ Premium subscription.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_CapturedInEngine_Akiva_Action_WIDE-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Genre and Setting</h2>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set between the events of the second and third films released in theaters: 1980's The Empire Strikes Back and 1983's Return of the Jedi. The developers picked this specific period in the story because it was a time when the Empire didn't care too much about certain illegal activities, allowing the criminal underworld to thrive. It is here that protagonist Kay Vess (played by actress Humberly González, who previously starred in Ubisoft's Far Cry 6 as Mercedes 'Jonrón' Martin), clearly inspired by the legendary scoundrel Han Solo, attempts one of the biggest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen with the help of her Merqaal companion Nix. Confirmed planets include Tatooine (the Mos Eisley cantina will be in the game), Kijimi, Akiva, and Toshara.</p>
<p>As far as genre goes, this is the first-ever open world Star Wars game, and it will feature typical third-person action/adventure mechanics. It's also single-player only.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_BuildYourReputation-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The game will place a significant emphasis on stealth. Kay is, after all, essentially a thief, and she can take down enemies after silently approaching them from behind. She'll be helped significantly by Nix, a tiny Merqqal who can distract enemies in various ways, such as attacking them head-on or interacting with the environment. Kay also has her trusty blaster and a series of gadgets to aid in combat situations.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the protagonist is a freelancer of sorts. As such, she'll have dealings with various factions from the criminal underworld, taking on high-risk, high-reward contracts. This all ties back to the reputation system built into the Star Wars Outlaws. Lead Systems Designer Matthieu Delisle recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-freeform-space-travel-between-planets-reputation-system-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>If you have a bad reputation with the syndicates, they won't let you in. You can sneak in, but if you get caught, you will be kicked out. However, if you have a good reputation once you've worked good rep with the Pyke Syndicate, for example, you'll be able to freely go in and then you can get access to a bunch of opportunities. That can be things like jobs for the syndicates, merchants with some of the better stuff for sale, intel, rumors, and can also be high-stakes Sabacc tables. The syndicates are hubs of opportunities that you get access to with the right rep.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, player choices will be critical, and some of them will take place in RPG-style branching dialogues, though this won't lead to multiple endings.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Star Wars Outlaws is the first open world game set in this beloved setting. Ubisoft Massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-big-assassins-creed-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the planets have all been handcrafted and will be as large as two or three zones from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Kay will have a speeder at her disposal to travel on the ground.</p>
<p>There is, of course, also space flight in the game with Kay's Trailblazer spaceship. However, Ubisoft clarified there wouldn't be freeform space travel, meaning that players will fast-travel (technically with the spaceship's hyperdrive) between the orbits of the various planets. Here, though, they'll find various points of interest, things to do, places to explore, and, of course, dogfights.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_JumpintothePilotSeat-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Technology &amp; Specs</h2>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is powered by Ubisoft Massive's acclaimed Snowdrop engine, already seen in Tom Clancy's The Division and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, among others. The studio has partnered with NVIDIA to support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reveals-star-wars-outlaws-black-myth-wukong-and-naraka-bladepoint-are-all-getting-dlss-3-and-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3</a> (Frame Generation), Reflex, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination, and RTX Global Illumination</a> on PCs equipped with GeForce RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Last month, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-intel-cpu-launch-partner-star-wars-outlaws-14th-gen-optimizations-game-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of a partnership with Intel on the CPU front. There will be a Star Wars Outlaws bundle for those who purchase qualifying Intel Core 14th Gen processors at select retailers. Moreover, Intel promises special optimizations for those users rocking these CPUs.</p>
<p>Ubisoft still hasn't shared the official system requirements for this game. We will update this article once they are released.</p>

<p data-characters="318" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Within every <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> game, an unseen force rules from the shadows to determine the flow of the game–alright, maybe that’s a bit dramatic but it’s not an exaggeration. At the core of MTG lies its greatest feature known as the <strong>Stack</strong> which plays a crucial role in determining how spells are resolved.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">Becoming an expert on the Stack isn’t necessary to enjoy MTG, but knowing the basics will set you apart from other players regardless of what <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/">deck archetype you play with</a>. With a little knowledge, you can look at a sequence of cards and understand the order in which they play out along with the board state afterward. This guide will serve as an introduction to the Stack and the various spells and actions that it applies (or doesn’t apply) to.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-stack-in-mtg" data-injectable="false">What is the Stack in MTG?</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">The Stack isn’t represented physically within an MTG game. Though to understand how it works, we can imagine the spells or abilities that are played within a step to be ‘stacked’ on top of each other. The system for determining how these cards resolve is known as <strong>‘first in, last out’</strong> or <strong>FILO</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">The Active Player (the player whose turn it is) introduces the first spell or ability to the Stack which can then be responded to by the Non-Active Players. This is another MTG system referred to as <strong>APNAP</strong> or <strong>‘Active Player, then Non-Active Player’</strong>. Players can continue to respond back and forth by adding cards to the Stack until they’re out of mana or appropriate responses. After all players pass their priority, the Stack begins to resolve the spells from top to bottom (remember FILO?)&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">Still a bit confused? Let’s go over an example. One of your first encounters with the Stack will be when you cast a creature spell and your opponent responds with a counterspell. Here’s how this basic two-card Stack would play out:&nbsp;</p> <ol data-found-items="3" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false"> <li>Casting a creature spell uses the Stack which gives your opponents a chance to respond. Imagine that when casting the spell, the card is sitting in a waiting room. The creature hasn’t entered the battlefield yet and won’t do so unless it successfully resolves.&nbsp;</li> <li>The counterspell goes on top of the creature spell and if no other cards are added, will be the first card to resolve. What happens is that the counterspell resolves and effectively negates the resolution of the creature spell underneath it.&nbsp;</li> <li>The creature card never enters the battlefield and isn’t considered ‘killed’ so any respective triggers aren’t activated. It’s simply moved to the graveyard.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-the-stack-example.webp&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Fairly simple right? But in MTG, things can quickly become complicated. The Stack is used by many actions and spells but some don’t go onto the Stack and therefore cannot be responded to. Understanding what interacts with the Stack can help you make more informed decisions in MTG. Let’s take a look at what uses and doesn’t use the Stack.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What uses the Stack in MTG?</h2> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true"> <li>Casting spells</li> <li>Activated abilities (not to be confused with mana abilities)</li> <li>Triggered abilities</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">The list of what uses the Stack looks small, but it encompasses the majority of processes found within <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What doesn’t use the Stack in MTG?</h2> <ul data-found-items="16" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="770" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Special actions (such as<strong> </strong>Foretell or Morph)</li> <li data-index="1">Mana abilities (tapping a land for mana is considered a mana ability.)</li> <li data-index="2">Playing land cards</li> <li data-index="3">Paying costs (such as cumulative upkeep)</li> <li data-index="4">Static abilities (abilities that are always active, such as Flying or First Strike)</li> <li data-index="5">Combat damage (the combat damage itself isn’t added to the Stack but abilities that trigger from combat damage are)</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-mtg-turn-phases-and-steps-explained/">All turn-based actions</a> <ul> <li data-index="6">Phasing in/phasing out permanents</li> <li data-index="7">Drawing a card during the draw step</li> <li data-index="8">Discarding cards during the cleanup step</li> <li data-index="9">Day and night transitions</li> <li data-index="10">Placing Lore counters on Sagas upon entering the first Main Phase</li> <li data-index="11">Rolling to visit Attractions</li> <li data-index="12">Choosing opponents to attack at the beginning of the combat step</li> <li data-index="13">Declaring attackers (not to be confused with triggers from creatures attacking)</li> <li data-index="14">Declaring blockers (not to be confused with triggers from being attacked)</li> <li data-index="15">Designating the damage assignment order amongst blocking creatures (which creature blocks first)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">While the above list can look a bit intimidating, it’s worth pointing out that many actions that don’t use the Stack flow naturally within the game and aren’t controlled by players. Focus on remembering the three actions that do use the Stack and you’ll be just fine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">The Stack is often treated like the Boogeyman of MTG but it can be every player’s best friend. Take advantage of it and don’t be afraid to start a chain of counterspells– it happens more often than you think.&nbsp;</p>

There was a lot of hype for the release of <em>Dark Souls</em> <em>Remastered</em> back in 2018, but the final product left a lot to be desired. Even though it didn’t introduce new problems, it just didn’t offer much in terms of graphical improvements. In fact, the remastered version looks so similar to the original <em>Prepare To Die</em> release that I trust this is the first time you’re reminded you haven’t been playing the OG <em>Dark Souls</em> PC since you paid for the remaster.</p> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Are you sick of waiting for <em>Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree</em>, but don’t want to go through another playthrough of the base game? Then it’s a good time to revisit the series’ roots, as modder <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftserve">fromsoftserve</a> just released <em>Dark Souls Re-Remastered</em>, a mod that offers many of the graphical improvements that should’ve been present on the official remaster.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-operation-new-blood-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reveals-operation-new-blood-for-rainbow-six-siege.881925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-operation-new-blood-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ubisoft has officially lifted the lid on Operation New Blood, the next season of Rainbow Six Siege. It’s bringing a vast array of changes to the game’s ecosystem, introducing two new (kind of) Operators, and kicking off the global launch of the Marketplace. With a 25-minute video, Ubisoft broke down everything that players are going to receive at the core of Operation New Blood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-changes">Prepare for Changes</h2>



<p>Arguably the biggest component of Operation New Blood is the introduction of Striker and Sentry, two new Operators that are modelled on the ‘Recruit’ persona in Rainbow Six. These highly customisable characters are designed to be ‘introductory Operators’, being introduced as ‘Swiss-Army Knife’ characters. They won’t have unique abilities but they will have a slew of gadgets and weapons that they can use to remain versatile.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also confirmed that the in-game Marketplace is going live, but there are some prerequisites. Only players with 2FA activated <strong>and </strong>a LL25 account will be able to access the Marketplace and start trading with other players.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: Operation New Blood Reveal Panel" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPsE9sn5TdI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Elsewhere, onboarding and training elements have been buffed. An ‘Endless Drill’ mechanic has been introduced that’ll allow players to warm up more effectively before their matches. Similarly, Ubisoft has made the game’s ecosystem much more reliable and welcoming by boosting the anti-cheat and player protection systems, such as by pairing with Steam and using the VAC ban mechanics to ensure malicious operators can’t create multiple accounts to keep up their griefing.</p>



<p>In terms of balancing, both Fenrir and Solis have been hit pretty hard. They’ve had their gadgetry switched out and their abilities have been switched up a little. For instance, Fenrir’s F-NATTs only have two charges now, and Solis’ goggles can’t be used in Prep and they have a 10-second duration rather than 20 seconds. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/first-time-reader-heres-your-beginners-guide-to-the-red-rising-space-opera-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-time-reader-heres-your-beginners-guide-to-the-red-rising-space-opera-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Here’s everything you need to know about <em>Red Rising</em>, Pierce Brown’s beloved dystopian book series which has remained a definite pick of almost every top 10 sci-fi listicle in the past decade.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Taking place in the far future, <em>Red Rising </em>combines elements of conventional space opera epics with Asimov-inspired motifs to open a new chapter in spacefaring storytelling. Brown’s fast-paced narrative, richly-detailed worldbuilding, and lifelike characters have all contributed to <em>Red Rising</em>’s massive success over the years.</p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">The American author has written 6 books in the series so far, with a seventh and final installment expected to bring the series to a conclusion in the near future. There’s also a live-action series in the works at Universal Pictures, though we’re no closer to hearing anything new about that project than we were when interest in a potential adaptation grew in 2021. But you’re here to know about the story itself, so let’s get ride to it.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-the-plot-of-red-rising-by-pierce-brown" data-injectable="false"><strong>What is the plot of <em>Red Rising</em> by Pierce Brown?</strong></h2> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Taking place several hundred years in the future, the first <em>Red Rising </em>novel opens on Mars. Humanity has colonized planets and moons in the Solar System, and but regressed back to a splintered hierarchy of social classes designated by color. At the top of this pyramid are the Golds, who rule with an iron first and have enhanced their physical abilities and features thanks to genetic engineering and breeding programs.</p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Next comes the Silvers, the Coppers, the Pinks, the Obsidians, the Blues and the Yellows, each taking up a unique function in society. Last comes the Reds, who are laborers and miners and generally considered the lowest class, essentially slaves in all but name.</p> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">Our main protagonist is a Red named Darrow. He and other fellow Reds are working underground on Mars to make the world habitable for future generations, little knowing that Mars has been habitable for quite a while. A tragedy turns Darrow’s life upside down, putting him in touch with a group of rebel Reds (called the Sons of Ares) who are trying to infiltrate the Golds and dismantle the prejudiced system from within.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">This sets the stage for <em>Red Rising</em>’s main narrative thrust, and though it may sound too cliche and worn at first glance, Pierce Brown’s story is anything but, weaving together history and philosophy in an action-packed plot that will have you at the edge of your seat from the first few chapters to the very end. <em>Red Rising </em>is nothing if not a page-turner.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>How many books are in the <em>Red Rising</em> series?</strong></h2> <p data-characters="94" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">As mentioned earlier, Pierce Brown has written 6 main books in the <em>Red Rising</em> saga. These are:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Red Rising</em> (2014)</li> <li><em>Golden Son</em> (2015)</li> <li><em>Morning Star </em>(2016)</li> <li><em>Iron Gold </em>(2018)</li> <li><em>Dark Age </em>(2019)</li> <li><em>Light Bringer</em> (2023)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">The final book in the series, titled <em>Red God</em>, is currently in the works, and hopefully, we won’t have to wait for it as long as we did between <em>Dark Age </em>and <em>Light Bringer</em>. Brown himself has confirmed via an Instagram post that <em>Red God </em>would be releasing “soon after” <em>Light Bringer</em>. As such, many fans believe 2025 will be the year when the <em>Red Rising </em>saga finally comes to a conclusion.</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">There is also a prequel comic series centering around the Sons of Ares (released under the title of <em>Red Rising: Sons of Ares</em>) and how they came together to oppose the Sovereign’s tyrannical government.</p> <figure data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Pierce Brown Talks Red Rising and LIGHT BRINGER!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1gMFY_MelA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>What can you expect from <em>Red Rising</em>, tonally and thematically?</strong></h2> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">As I already touched on this, <em>Red Rising </em>can feel derivative and downright cliche, especially when you’re reading the first book. Pierce Brown draws a lot of influence from<em> The Hunger Games </em>and other Battle Royale-esque stories of the last decade, so much so that at times, it might even remind you of some of the other prominent Young Adult novels out there. But <em>Red Rising </em>is more than the sum of its parts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="false">Book 2, <em>Golden Son</em>, marks a massive improvement over the original, both in prose and storytelling terms. And by the time you’re done with the first trilogy, <em>Red Rising</em> will have turned into one of your favorite sci-fi stories. The setting is dystopian and brutal, the action scenes can be gritty, and there are a lot of grotesque elements like sexual violence to wade through when you’re starting out, so make sure to consider all of this if you decide to give Pierce Brown’s imaginative futuristic world a go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-many-books-are-in-stephen-kings-the-dark-tower-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-many-books-are-in-stephen-kings-the-dark-tower-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="269" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Stephen King’s <em>The Dark Tower</em> series may be one of the best in fantasy. It’s certainly one of the best series King has ever written. Not only because of every book in the main series but also because of the books that make up the wider series around those. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"><em>The Dark Tower</em> series is one that all Stephen King fans and fantasy readers should dive into. It tells a brilliant tale that weaves through time and space, blurring the lines between sci-fi, fantasy, and even horror at some points. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">The core series consists of several books that are a delight to read, but there’s more to this universe that I only stumbled upon as a Stephen King fan because I’d read the other material already. Anyone reading the series or looking to jump into it should consider these wider entries to help them determine the number of books in the series. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-many-books-are-in-the-dark-tower-series" data-injectable="false">How many books are in <em>The Dark Tower</em> series?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">There are <strong>eight books in the main <em>The Dark Tower</em> series</strong>. These are just the books that make up the series that you’ll read if you’re working through it from start to finish. These are as follows.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><em>The Gunslinger</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Drawing of the Three</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Waste Lands</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Wizard and Glass</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Wind Through the Keyhole</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Wolves of the Calla</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Song of Susanna</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Dark Tower</em></strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">However, there are several other novels that are linked to <em>The Dark Tower</em> by means of King’s ambitious shared universe. With these included, there are <strong>15 books in <em>The Dark Tower</em> series</strong>. Almost double what you might be expecting if you’re buying the set. The wider books you should read to get the context you need for their characters and concepts are as follows. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><em>The Stand</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Hearts in Atlantis</em></strong></li> <li><em><strong>Everything’s Eventual</strong></em></li> <li><strong><em>The Eyes of the Dragon</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Salem’s Lot</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Black House</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Insomnia</em></strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Lastly, there are a number of <em>The Dark Tower </em>graphic novels published by Marvel between 2007 and 2017 that serve to flesh out the backstory of characters like Roland or adapt novellas. These are purely supplemental to the novels themselves, but these graphic novels look fantastic and are a nice way to keep expanding your knowledge of this absolutely massive, interlinking world. </p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Many King fans believe you can infer that most, if not all, of his novels are somehow connected to <em>The Dark Tower</em> series. It’s such a sprawling universe that everything could be connected to it because that’s how it’s been designed. I like to think that figuring out these connections is just a good excuse to read even more of Stephen King’s work. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Do you have to read Stephen King’s other books to understand <em>The Dark Tower</em> series?</h2> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">No, you don’t have to read anything other than <em>The Dark Tower</em> series to enjoy that specific set of books. However, Stephen King has been crafting a universe ever since he first started writing short stories for magazines and TV shows. They all interconnect in some way, and the ones that link with <em>The Dark Tower</em> series do so for a reason. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="false">There are characters you’ll meet in the books that are linked to <em>The Dark Tower</em> series that you get more out of by understanding their stories and where they’ve come from. It’s almost like watching<em> The Avengers</em> without having watched the individual superhero movies. You understand who everyone is, but you’ll miss certain nods to their past or references that give context to a situation or character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/rainbow-six-siege-y9s2-operation-new-blood-remasters-recruit-updates-fenrir-and-solis-and-opens-the-marketplace/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rainbow-six-siege-y9s2-operation-new-blood-remasters-recruit-updates-fenrir-and-solis-and-opens-the-marketplace<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Rainbow Six Siege: Operation New Blood</em> is the game’s second season for its ninth year. It looks back at the game’s past to make old Operators more viable while providing meaningful updates that will make the game healthier and offer more to seasoned veterans and newcomers. </p> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true"><em>Operation New Blood</em> doesn’t bring a fancy new Operator to the table in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a></em>. Instead, it goes right back to the beginning, to an Operator that’s more of a meme than anything else and transforms them into a viable character you can take into any match. Ubisoft invited me to a press briefing on the new season to show me what it’s all about, and I’m confident everyone, whether you’re brand new to the game or have played since day one, will appreciate the impact it’s going to have. </p>
 <h2 id="h-recruit-gets-remastered-as-striker-and-sentry-operators" data-injectable="false">Recruit gets remastered as Striker and Sentry Operators</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The part we all care about in each new season of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is, of course, the new Operator. As I’ve already mentioned, <em>Operation New Blood</em> doesn’t add a new Operator because the team has completely revamped and remastered Recruit. </p>
 <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">That’s right; the operator who caused everyone in the lobby to start a recruiting party is no longer there. Recruit now has two Operators: Striker for Attackers and Sentry for Defenders. They each feature slight visual tweaks so you can tell them apart, with Striker wearing a rappelling harness and Sentry donning a helmet. </p> <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="877" data-injectable="true">The differences between the two are so much more than skin-deep, though. Their ability is to equip two of any of the gadgets available to the team they’re on. In many ways, this is so much more powerful than any other Operator abilities because you can create a character with gear that plays to your strengths without limitations. You can lay unexpected traps as Sentry to catch out incoming Attackers with combinations they can’t predict and bring the tools that fit you best as Striker to force Defenders to think outside the box. </p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">The customization bleeds a little into the weapons the pair can equip. Striker can use the M4 and M249 primary and ITA12S and 5.7 USG secondary weapons. Sentry has a choice between the Commando 9 or M870 primaries and C75 Auto or Super Shorty secondaries. As with the gadgets, it’s up to you how you equip your Operator so you have every advantage when going into a match. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="717" data-injectable="true">The reason the development team opted to remaster Recruit is because he was basically never used, as was the intention. He was there if you didn’t have an Operator to choose from as a backup, and because multiple players could use him, an unwritten rule evolved where everyone had to be Recruit if there was one Recruit in a lobby. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">Now that Recruit is Sentry and Striker, only one player can use them, so there are no more Recruit parties. That’s a small sacrifice to make for the ability to bring an unexpected and overpowered loadout into every match, though. No longer is Recruit a joke. These new Operators should have teams quaking in their boots. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Fenrir and Solis reworks</h3> <figure data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">In addition to Recruit’s glorious remaster, Ubisoft wanted to begin examining other Operators and bring them in line with the modern meta. With Operation New Blood, Fenrir and Solis are being reworked, so their abilities are slightly weaker, meaning teams don’t need to build around them or specifically counter them. </p> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">Solis’ SPEC-IO Electro-Sensor is a nightmare because it picks up electronic devices Attackers are using, be they drones, traps, or other devices, and pings them for the entire team. That ability is still intact, but it’s being limited to a 10-second capacity from 15. You’ll also need to allow the glasses to fully charge before using them again, so you’ve got to make every use count. </p>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Furthermore, Solis now can’t use this ability during the Prep Phase, and even once that’s over, she can’t detect stationary drones that aren’t being used by an Attacker. So you could place a drone in the Prep Phase and use it in the middle of a match to work around Solis’ ability now. </p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">Finally, Solis’ detection rate has been decreased to force players using her to step out of their comfort zone a bit more. You’ve got to weigh up the risk of exposing yourself against the possible rewards of traps and drones you think you’ve seen. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Fenrir is having his F-NATT Dread Mine capacity dropped to 4 from 5 and activation codes have also decreased from 4 to 3. This means he has fewer mines to detonate and can only lay three effective traps before the ability is useless, so players using him have to think much more carefully about how they’ll use the mines they have. </p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">You can’t waste mines now. You’ve got to consider where Defenders will be, what the main routes are, how you want to push enemy players into a specific room or trap them somewhere, and make every mine count. The goal with these changes was to make Fenrir less scary, and he certainly sounds it with his ability curtailed. </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">With the launch of <em>Operation New Blood</em>, Fenrir will also lose barbed wire as a gadget and get observation blockers instead. Once again, this makes him so much less of a threat, so you don’t need to build a team or pick an Operator to specifically work against him. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Maps and modes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">Map filtering comes to <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> this season. This allows you to pick any map across ranked and non-ranked matches to get into the matches you desperately want to play. It should help players practice on the maps they’re uncomfortable with but also let us casual players stick to the maps we know so we can be useful for our team. </p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Later during <em>Operation New Blood</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>‘s Attrition mode will return as a limited-time event. The rules of these matches eliminate all previously used Operators over rounds, and five are eliminated before you even start. It encourages play with new characters but also chaotic gameplay as players attempt to win using gadgets they have no idea how to work. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft took a look at the Stadium Alpha and Bravo maps this season because they know they’re fan favorites, but they’re not built for regular play. That’s not changed, with better routes and clearer lines of sight to objectives specifically, so each map can be played like a traditional match and used more frequently. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">It’s no secret that <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is a difficult game to get into. <em>Operation New Blood</em> changes the onboarding process to make it a bit more approachable. The Versus playlist is getting loads of new content, with more playable Operators like Blackbeard, Ace, and Hibana, and AI Defenders playing Vigil and Thunderbird to help provide a more realistic experience for those learning the ropes. </p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">There’s also a new training mode, Endless Drill, that pits players against dummies they must hunt down and kill in a colossal building consisting of multiple floors. This training session can last for 60 minutes and sounds brutal, but it’ll help you figure out the mechanics you must know in every match without someone shouting at you or shooting you for being new. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Player protection</h2> <figure data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">Speaking of player toxicity, Ubisoft is keen to reduce it as much as possible. It’s still working on the Reputation System that will eventually track your games played and the ratings others have given you based on your behavior, but it’s not quite ready yet. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">More immediately, Ubisoft has made what it claims to be a seven-fold improvement in how it makes bans, resulting in 60% more player bans and a huge reduction in toxicity. It’s also working on DDoS detection and a slew of other systems that will make it easier to detect cheaters and create a safer space for everyone. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Marketplace and Membership</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">After a successful stint in beta, the Marketplace is opening up to all players above Level 25 in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> from <strong>June 25, 2024</strong>. This is where you’ll be able to buy and sell cosmetics using R6 Credits, meaning each one you earn now has far more value. I think the best part of Marketplace will be the ability to complete cosmetic sets you’ve got pieces of from past events or just get the entire set from someone who doesn’t want it. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The last new feature <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is getting with <em>Operation New Blood</em> is Membership. Think of this as the Fortnite Crew subscription of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. The Membership fee, which is $9.99 per month or $79.99 for the year, awards you exclusive Epic cosmetics and the Battle Pass’s premium track. If you renew your Membership every month, you’ll get even more items, such as Operator Cards, for that loyalty. </p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false"><em>Operation New Blood</em> is a season that seeks to level the playing field in <em>Rainbow Six Siege,</em> so it’s easier to get into and compete against long-time fans once you’ve developed the necessary skills in its upgraded training. The aspects I’m most excited about are Sentry and Striker because I can’t wait to ruin the enemy’s day with my insane loadout and erratic behavior. I’m sure this will bode well for Attrition when it arrives, too. </p>

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Steven Erikson’s <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> is one of the most sprawling fantasy sagas ever written. The plot unfolds over thousands of years, documenting the expansive and turbulent history of the Malazan Empire through the perspectives of a vast cast of rich characters. </p> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">As you can probably tell, the <em>Malazan</em> series has a gigantic scope, making it tricky for new readers to know which book to read first. Fortunately, the saga is broken into five sub-series, making it slightly easier to decipher where each book falls on the timeline.</p> <h2 id="h-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-release-order" data-injectable="false">Malazan Book of the Fallen release order</h2> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> chronicles the triumphs and tribulations of the titular empire, following the deeply interwoven tales of those caught in the vicious cycle of violent expansion and near-disastrous decline that defines Malazan’s history. The primary <em>Malazan </em>series includes twenty books and six novellas collected into two anthologies.</p>

 <h2 id="h-what-is-the-definitive-malazan-reading-order" data-injectable="false">What is the definitive Malazan reading order?</h2> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">I don’t think there’s any reason not to read the <em>Malazan</em> books in the official reading order. Some <em>Malazan</em> fans argue that new readers should read the books in the <em>Malazan Books of the Fallen</em> set first, as they tell what could be considered the “main” story of the series. Others argue that you should read the book chronologically, which gives you a clear picture of how the Malazan Empire and the world around it came to be.</p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">As a <em>Malazan</em> fan, I’d recommend sticking with the publication order. While you won’t know all the details about some of the characters who pop up for a while, reading the books in the order they were released gives you the clearest picture of the three major plotlines that tie the series together. Once you get to later books, you’ll receive new information about certain characters that will reframe their role in the series in fun and unexpected ways.</p>

<p data-characters="326" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The only correct answer to the age-old question, “Who doesn’t love dragons?” is nobody. Almost every culture has at least one story about a dragon or dragon-adjacent creature, and those myths have inspired countless fantasy writers to tell their own stories about the most iconic creature in all of folklore.</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Fantasy writers have penned hundreds of dragon-themed fantasy novels over the years, and I’ve read a good chunk of them. As a self-taught dragon expert, I am qualified to talk about the pieces of draconic literature that soar above their competition. Here are my picks for the top 10 fantasy books about dragons.</p> <h3 id="h-10-eragon-by-christopher-paolini" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. Eragon by Christopher Paolini</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Anyone who went to elementary, middle, or high school during the mid-2000s saw Eragon on a library shelf. The first of Paolini’s four-part <em>Inheritance Cycle</em> series, <em>Eragon </em>tells the tale of the titular farm boy, who forms a bond with a newly-hatched dragon and embarks on a journey to save the world from a tyrannical king, who happens to be a former member of an order of dragon-riding warriors.</p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"><em>Eragon</em> and its sequels have gotten a lot of well-deserved flack for blatantly copying world-building and plot elements from other fantasy novels. With that said, the book introduced millions of young fantasy readers to the concept of dragon-riding, and for that, it deserves a spot on this list.</p> <h3 id="h-9-the-lost-hero-by-rick-riordan" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney-Hyperion Books</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">The first book in the second installment of Rick Riordan’s legendary <em>Camp-Half-Blood Chronicles</em> series, <em>The Lost Hero</em> follows a trio of teenage demi-gods as they embark on a quest to discover what happened to the titular hero of <em>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</em>. Their primary mode of transportation is a robotic dragon the size of a monster truck.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">If a mechanical dragon flying over the skies of Chicago doesn’t sound like something you’d be interested in, don’t worry; it’s not the only incredible fantasy creature in the book. Honestly, the only reason <em>The Lost Hero</em> is ranked so low is that the mech-dragon (whose name translates to Happy) isn’t in it as much as the cover would have you believe.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-fablehaven-secrets-of-the-dragon-sanctuary-by-brandon-mull" data-injectable="false"><strong>8. Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary by Brandon Mull</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Shadow Mountain Publishing</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">Brandon Mull’s <em>Fablehaven</em> series is one of the most underrated YA fantasy sagas out there, and its fourth installment is perfect for dragon fans. Continuing the adventures of siblings Seth and Kendra Sorenson, <em>Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary</em> sees the duo delve into Wyrmroost, an animal sanctuary for magical creatures built to house dragons of all shapes and sizes.</p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Secrets has a dragon for everybody; it’s got a small fairy dragon, it’s got a poisonous serpentine dragon, and it’s even got a black-winged demon dragon who serves as the main villain. Unfortunately, <em>Secret </em>is the penultimate chapter of a very interconnected five-book series, so you can only enjoy it by reading the previous <em>Fablehaven </em>books first. But like I said, <em>Fablehaven </em>is a great read, so that is fine.</p>
 <h3 id="h-7-how-to-train-your-dragon-by-cressida-cowell" data-injectable="false"><strong>7. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dreamworks</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Dreamworks turned <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> into a household name with their epic trilogy of films, but the story of Hiccup and Toothless began as a book by Cressida Cowell. There are many differences between the original <em>How</em> novel and its film adaption, the most noticeable being that Vikings and dragons get along from the start.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">One thing that got noticed in translation was the story’s focus on the bond between a boy and his dragon. Alone in a world that doesn’t find much value in either of them, Hiccup and Toothless find hope and affirmation in each other, and seeing their relationship grow from a convenient alliance into a true friendship is bound to melt readers’ hearts.</p> <h3 id="h-6-ascendant-by-micheal-j-miller" data-injectable="false"><strong>6. Ascendant by Micheal J. Miller</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Michael R. Miller</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">A much darker take on the traditional “boy-meets-dragon” tale, the first installment of Micheal J. Millers’ <em>Song of Chaos</em> series pulls no punches. Weakness is a curse in the world Holt Cook was born in, so when he goes against the grain and saves a blind dragon hatchling from an early and “well-deserved” death, the consequences are as immediate as they are earth-shattering.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false"><em>Ascendant</em> has enough high-flying dragon-riding adventure to keep the average fantasy fan reading. Still, it’s not afraid to tackle challenging subjects like ableism, disability rights, and the importance of self-advocacy. Be prepared for some heavy feels.</p> <h3 id="h-5-nimona-by-nd-stevenson" data-injectable="false"><strong>5. Nimona by ND Stevenson</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HarperCollins</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">I’ll admit that I might be cheating a little by putting <em>Nimona</em> on this list. ND Stevenson’s seminal webcomic-turned-graphic novel is technically about a shapeshifter, but the titular changeling’s favorite form is that of a dragon, so it counts.</p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true"><em>Nimona</em> is a fairly standard story about a rebellious mimic’s quest to destroy a corrupt order of seemingly heroic knights at first glance. If you dig a little deeper, however, you’ll find that <em>Nimona</em> is a thoughtful exploration of the LGBTQ+ experience and the importance of standing up against exclusionary institutions and systems.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-the-hobbit-by-j-r-r-tolkien" data-injectable="false"><strong>4. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">Let’s be honest; how could I not include <em>The Hobbit</em> on a list like this? J.R.R. Tolkien grew up hearing tales of heroes slaying dragons, and the book that introduced the realm of Middle-Earth to the world is a testament to his love for the scaly beasts.</p>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Within the first few chapters of <em>The Hobbit</em>, it’s crystal clear that Bilbo’s journey to the Misty Mountains will end with him confronting the dragon Smaug. While I could go into more detail about how Smaug shaped the public’s perception of dragons, the fact that the aptly named “Dragon Dread” is the template most fantasy writers use to model their dragons after says all that needs to be said.</p>
 <h3 id="h-3-dragonflight-by-anne-mccaffrey" data-injectable="false"><strong>3. Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via pernesedragons.tumblr.com</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">Anne McCaffrey did not invent the idea of dragon-riding, but she did inject it into the public imagination with her <em>Dragonriders of Pern</em> saga. I could have filled this list with entries from this series, but none of these entries would exist if it weren’t for <em>Dragonflight</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><em>Dragonflight</em> does a fantastic job introducing the world of Pern, where humans and dragons fight side-by-side to keep a parasitic fungus known as Thread from consuming everything on the planet. This world-building is woven organically into <em>Dragonflight</em>‘s already exciting plot, which revolves around a banished princess’ quest to reclaim her kingdom from a wicked usurper. If you like what you read, keep reading; there’s plenty of Pern left for you to experience.</p>
 <h3 id="h-2-dealing-with-dragons-by-patricia-c-wrede" data-injectable="false"><strong>2. Dealing With Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Jane Yolen Books &amp; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Most traditional stories about dragons portray them as mindless beasts who fly around scorching villages and kidnapping young maidens. However, recent contemporary titles have challenged the idea that dragons are inherently malicious, and that turn began with Patricia C. Wrede’s <em>Dealing with Dragons</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Set in a world where classical fairy tale tropes are law, the rebellious princess Cimorene decides to buck tradition by running away from home and voluntarily becoming the “prisoner” of the feared dragon Kazul. Cimorene is a refreshingly nonconformist protagonist, and her non-violent approach to conflict makes <em>Dealing with Dragons</em> an excellent pick for kids who may have trouble holding their tempers.</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-the-dragonet-prophecy-by-tui-t-sutherland" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. The Dragonet Prophecy by Tui T. Sutherland</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Scholastic</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Tui T. Sutherland’s <em>Wings of Fire</em> series does what dragon enthusiasts have been asking for for years: it makes dragons the main characters of a fantasy epic. On the continents of Pyrrhia and Pantala, dragons reign supreme, and humans are little more than animals to be eaten or studied from afar.</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"><em>The Dragonet Prophecy</em>, the first book in Sutherland’s series, weaves an epic coming-of-age tale about young dragons who find themselves caught amid a bloody civil war of succession. This book, and those that follow it, have a little something for every degree of dragon fan, and that’s why it’s the best fantasy book about dragons.</p>

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re a <em>One Piece</em> fan, then you probably take pride in the franchise’s impeccable world-building. If you don’t, why aren’t you? Eiichiro Oda is a genius when it comes to lore development, so much so that new revelations often give rise to a slew of new questions. At least, that’s usually the case.</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">With the series <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-one-piece-arcs-ever-ranked/">entering its final arc</a>, Oda is starting to drop one big revelation after another, such as the ever-elusive Dr. Vegapunk finally making his appearance. But despite the consecutive lore dumps, there remain multiple unanswered mysteries, such as these. </p> <figure data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via ONE PIECE Official YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-what-is-the-one-piece" data-injectable="false">1. What is the One Piece?</h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">The titular treasure is the main driving point of the series’ narrative. Gol D. Roger’s proclamation of the One Piece’s existence spurred the Great Age of Piracy, and Whitebeard’s last words reignited the world’s interest in it. The rules stay the same. Whoever finds the greatest treasure is set to be the next Pirate King.</p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="836" data-injectable="true">It’s been decades since <em>One Piece</em>‘s release, and fans of the series still have no inkling of what the treasure may be. Interestingly, most characters in the series are in the same predicament. Only those who accompanied Gol D. Roger on his final voyage know what the treasure actually is. While we don’t know what One Piece is, we at least know what One Piece is not. After all, Oda already confirmed that it would not be some nonsense like memories or friendship.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation </figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-what-is-luffy-s-dream" data-injectable="false">2. What is Luffy’s dream?</h2> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">Luffy has repeatedly proclaimed his goal to become the King of the Pirates countless times, but that’s not the dream I am referring to. After leaving Wano Country, Luffy told his crewmates about an old dream of his. He also told Ace and Sabo about the same dream during their younger years. Unfortunately, though, we didn’t receive the same privilege. </p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">What we do know, however, is that it cannot be something ordinary. After all, both his crewmates and his brothers called his dream crazy, and crazy pretty much aligns with Luffy’s character.</p> <figure data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via ONE PIECE Official YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-what-exactly-is-uranus" data-injectable="false">3. What exactly is Uranus?</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">The Ancient Weapons are said to be the strongest weapons in <em>One Piece</em> verse. Each one is capable of destroying countries on their own. We were acquainted with Poseidon, who turns out to be Princess Shirahoshi. While we are yet to see Pluton in actuality, we are at least aware that it comes in the form of a ship. Franky already destroyed its blueprints, though, so there is less chance for us to witness its destructive glory.</p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">Unlike the other two, Uranus remains a total mystery. We only know that Uranus exists, but we have no idea of its whereabouts or its capabilities. For all we know, it may already be in the World Government’s hands.</p> <figure data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-what-secrets-does-the-void-century-hold" data-injectable="false">4. What secrets does the Void Century hold?</h2> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">As its name suggests, the Void Century pertains to the time period with almost no historical records. It’s not that the records have magically disappeared; it’s just that the World Government is sparing no effort in eradicating its traces. They destroyed any records about the Void Century and made researching it a capital offense.</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">What exactly happened during the Void Century, you ask? That, we don’t know. However, the Void Century is said to hold the true history of the world. The only remaining means of unraveling its mysteries is by deciphering the Poneglyphs, which is something only Nico Robin can do.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via IMDB</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-what-role-does-the-nefeltari-family-play" data-injectable="false">5. What role does the Nefeltari family play?</h2> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The Nefeltari family was introduced early on with Vivi seeking the Straw Hats’ help to free her country. However, recent developments reveal that the Nefeltari family is more than just ordinary royals. They turned out to be one of the twenty monarchs who established the World Government, but unlike the other nineteen, they opted out of ascending to Mary Geoise.</p>
 <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Lili, the then-queen of Alabasta, vanished before returning to her kingdom. With Lili turning out to have inherited the Will of D, a new question arises: What role did and will the Nefeltari family play in the grand scheme of things, especially since learning of Lili’s true identity warranted ending King Cobra’s life?</p> <figure data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-what-is-the-will-of-d" data-injectable="false">6. What is the Will of D?</h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Speaking of the Will of D, that is another mystery that is yet to be answered. Many prominent characters possess the initial D, and most of them are said to make waves in the world. A few who bear this initial are Monkey D. Luffy and his kin, the above-mentioned Nefeltari D. Lili and her kin, Gol D. Roger, and Marshall D. Teech.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">Based on those examples, there really must be something with the initial D. However, only future chapters of <em>One Piece</em> can reveal what that something is.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-why-was-zunesha-punished" data-injectable="false">7. Why was Zunesha punished?</h2> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece </em>is no stranger to weird islands, but Zou remains unique. The moving island home of the Mink Tribe can move because it sits on top of a gigantic elephant—Zunesha.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">Recent developments revealed that Zunesha isn’t just a mindless, perpetual-moving creature. In fact, Zunesha was Joy Boy’s companion who was punished for committing a certain crime. As to what that specific crime is, we can only make guesses at the moment. </p> <figure data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-what-wonders-does-the-ancient-kingdom-hold" data-injectable="false">8. What wonders does the Ancient Kingdom hold?</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The Ancient Kingdom was once a very powerful kingdom, so powerful that 20 other kingdoms joined arms to eradicate it. After Luffy and the Straw Hats met Vegapunk, they learned that despite being named the Ancient Kingdom, it was a technologically advanced civilization. </p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">These bits and pieces, however, fail to give the whole picture of the Ancient Kingdom’s grandeur. After all, Vegapunk also stated that despite Egghead being renowned as a Future Island, it was far from reaching the Ancient Kingdom’s level.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via ONE PIECE Official YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-9-what-secrets-does-blackbeard-hold" data-injectable="false">9. What secrets does Blackbeard hold?</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Blackbeard is probably one of the most detestable characters in <em>One Piece</em>. He betrayed his original crew, handed Ace to the Marines, stole Whitebeard’s Devil Fruit powers, and the list just goes on. However, it’s undeniable that he is one effective villain, and part of it is how mysterious he is.</p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Blackbeard is the only character known to handle two Devil Fruit powers. According to Buggy, Blackbeard could also go days without a wink of sleep. Marco also noted that he had a rather unique body, though he didn’t specify why. While many theories are floating around — including Blackbeard having multiple personalities — the series has yet to provide a definitive answer.</p> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-who-is-luffy-s-mom" data-injectable="false">10. Who is Luffy’s Mom?</h2> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">A very simple query, yet it continues to boggle many fans’ minds. We already know about Luffy’s father, the revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, and his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp. However, little is known about his mother and grandmother. So, why focus on Luffy’s mother? Because there are more interesting discussions about her.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="false">There are many theories about who Luffy’s mom can be, but my favorite is the one involving Crocodile. The theory states that Crocodile was originally a woman who turned into a man using Ivankov’s Devil Fruit powers. Ivankov’s ties with the Revolutionary Army give the theory some weight.</p>

  <p id="c4wp9l">Not every filmmaker gets their debut feature enshrined in the Criterion Collection. But not every filmmaker’s debut feature packs the punch <em>Girlfight </em>does.</p>
<p id="LNJbZF">Decades after release, Karyn Kusama’s debut movie, <em>Girlfight</em>, still holds up — it’s no surprise that it launched her career as a director of subversive horror drama (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/19/21524290/what-to-watch-netflix-amazon-hulu-jennifers-body-babadook-over-garden-wall"><em>Jennifer’s Body</em></a>, <em>The Invitation</em>) and memorable television (<em>Yellowjackets</em>, <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>), along with launching Michelle Rodriguez as a star. <em>Girlfight</em> is coming to the <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/33189-girlfight">Criterion Collection on May 28</a>, with a brand-new 4K digital restoration supervised by Kusama, new interviews and commentary from the director, and a slick new cover by Jillian Adel.</p>
<p id="rWhsrE"><em>Girlfight</em>, the story of a troubled high schooler who takes up boxing in secret as an outlet for her frustrations, aches with high school emotions in and out of the boxing ring. At the same time, it subverts boxing-movie tropes. Rodriguez plays Diana Guzman, a teenager who’s frequently in trouble for fighting at school and alienated from her father (Paul Calderón) at home. When she tries boxing in secret to get some of that tension off her chest, she shows a real talent for the sweet science. At the gym, she meets a boy (named Adrian, making Diana the Rocky in this equation) and a new father figure in her trainer (Jaime Tirelli).</p>

<p id="8odOLW">Making <em>Girlfight </em>was a long process for Kusama, who wrote the movie after taking up boxing herself in 1992. Production companies begged her to cast a white woman in the lead role, but she stood her ground, insisting on a Latina lead and finding Rodriguez in an extensive audition process focusing largely on non-professional actors. After financiers backed out two days before pre-production in 1999, legendary filmmaker (and Kusama’s former mentor) John Sayles and his creative partner and producer Maggie Renzi stepped in and helped fund the film.</p>
<p id="BZNTDL">Polygon spoke to Kusama on a video call ahead of the movie’s Criterion release. We spoke about revisiting her first movie for the restoration, when she knew she had a star in Rodriguez, and whether <em>Girlfight </em>could be made the same way now.</p>
<p id="BOptin"><strong>Polygon: Congratulations on </strong><em><strong>Girlfight </strong></em><strong>being added to the Criterion Collection. When did you find out, and what was your reaction?</strong></p>
<p id="sA2B7b"><strong>Karyn Kusama: </strong>This must have been last year, Criterion reached out to me and said, “We’d really like to remaster <em>Girlfight</em> and release an edition of the film.” I was floored and so excited. I am such a Criterion nerd, as you might imagine, so it was literally a dream come true. For me, this just felt like the ultimate stamp of approval.</p>
<p id="tBiG5C"><strong>Does it mean more to you because it was this one?</strong></p>
<p id="Gu63K5">I think what I appreciate is that it’s my first movie. And as someone now who’s got more than 20 years of time and experience to look back at the film, there’s so many things I might do differently — I might improve, I might cut, or change or refine. And so the idea that it can still work for anyone, despite the fact that I would love to get back in there and completely retool it, that’s gratifying.</p>

<p id="2kcVRt"><strong>Watching it now, I was struck by the balance between the boxing elements, the family drama, the character study, Michelle Rodriguez’s amazing performance, and the high school romance. How do you think back on the balance of all those elements?</strong></p>
<p id="ipCsFP">I never felt like I would want to make a purely boxing-oriented movie. In some ways, the true story is about this character entering a new world, and finding a place for herself within it. And in doing so, opening herself up to a kind of vulnerability that she doesn’t feel capable of exposing at home. It is so much about this tension between the closed emotional world of her family life and the more expansive emotional world of, paradoxically, a boxing ring. So that was something I knew I wanted to do. But I don’t know at the time if I was really weighing the balance of it all. </p>
<p id="IJLL9B">In somewhat ham-fisted terms, I was trying to tell a story about a young woman for whom traditional expressions of femininity didn’t quite feel true to her. And so it was so much about trying to find a path toward self-acceptance, toward some kind of openness, to whatever kind of weirdo she ultimately was going to be.</p>
<p id="mrAabE"><strong>When you look at the movie now, what would you want to tweak?</strong></p>
<p id="4bciV7">I think I would probably lift some scenes and tighten some scenes. I think I would know a little bit more how to evoke the same emotional impact with fewer cuts or fewer shots. I would just get to the heart of the matter faster. But that being said, I think some of what I wrestle with in the movie is also inherent to it, you know, which is a lot of non-actors, a lot of young, raw performances. And in some respects, that’s part of the charm, I hope, of the movie.</p>
<p id="qAdsgY"><strong>And it helps that the central three of her family are so strong</strong>.</p>
<p id="D5reEq">Oh, good. Yeah, I think so. Obviously, Paul Calderón [who played Marie’s father] was a wonderful and well-known actor at the time, and still, and so he could kind of anchor the rest of the cast. But you know, it’s funny, I always find with movies, for me, it’s a process of making the thing, hoping that I made the truest thing I could make, and then moving on and not looking back. And so what’s really weird about doing the Criterion edition is — the process of looking back is both wonderful and painful. I was looking at the movie a lot. So it gave me a lot of time to think about, <em>Oh, I could have done that. I should have done that. </em>A lot of woulda, coulda, shoulda.</p>

<p id="cR4X2n"><strong>Do you think things have changed in the industry over the past two decades? Would making </strong><em><strong>Girlfight </strong></em><strong>now be the same, easier, or more difficult?</strong></p>
<p id="5OGSTx">That’s something I have to chew on. Because in some ways, obviously we all want the answer to be “Things are better now.” I think the hard reality is that we are still almost even more entrenched in a star-driven system. So it would be even harder now, I think, to make a movie with a completely fresh face as the center of the film.</p>
<p id="4yXalP">And luckily for me, when I made <em>Girlfight</em>, Michelle ended up having a true electric, charismatic star power that allowed her to continue to make movies. But now I find it’s still really, really hard. In terms of the questions around representation? I think the conversations are more deliberately coded around what is permissible. But I think ultimately, there is still a lot of resistance to a complicated or complex depiction of the world as we actually live in it. </p>
<p id="acr3Nv"><strong>Working with Michelle Rodriguez on the movie, what did you learn about what makes a movie star and how to showcase that?</strong></p>
<p id="6ctOC5">Oh, that’s such a good question. I mean, first of all, she has a funny un-self-consciousness as an actor. In the initial auditioning process, and initially working with her, I had to kind of remind her of staying in character and staying on book and all of the basics around being an actor. What she didn’t have was shame. There was a quality to her of just like, <em>I’m here. The world can start now.</em> And that quality of guileless confidence is really important. She demanded attention.</p>
<p id="wWE0ev">And that simple kind of intensity is something that I’ve really learned is actually not common across the board. It’s not like every actor I work with has that same intensity, though I’ve certainly worked with actors who had more training and more experience and more discipline. Michelle has a kind of ineffable charisma. </p>
<p id="pc2rRN"><strong>Was there a specific moment with her where you were like, </strong><em><strong>Oh, she’s different</strong></em><strong>, or is that just something that you learned over the course of filming?</strong></p>
<p id="AYEpox">It’s really funny, because I have such a vivid memory of doing all those initial auditions and having hundreds of people in front of us for interviews and short auditions. And we taped them all. And because I’m kind of obsessed with thoroughness, I decided to just go through the process of looking at all the tapes.</p>
<p id="j6ETch">And it was in that moment of looking at her tape, even though she was untrained, completely inexperienced, completely unprepared, kind of every negative you could imagine, she held the screen with such totality that I felt like, <em>Huh, that’s interesting. I have to keep looking at her, I have to keep engaging with this presence.</em> And so it just meant we kept bringing her back. But that initial feeling about her was definitely something that now I look at and I realize, <em>Oh, that was her. That was her star power.</em></p>

</p>
<p id="izlwnN"><strong>Would you have predicted her going on to star in major franchises like the Fast and the Furious?</strong></p>
<p id="EkuCUy">At the time, I couldn’t, but she called it for herself way earlier than I could have. Because she always knew what she liked. Immediately when she read <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>, she was like, <em>I know I have to do this, and I know it will be a global franchise</em>. She understood that part of entertainment a lot better than I did.</p>
<p id="jj93ug"><strong>Have there been opportunities for you to work with her on projects of that scale? Is that something you’re interested in?</strong></p>
<p id="Md2pRi">You mean like the giant franchises?</p>
<p id="QmaBjJ"><strong>Yeah. Doesn’t strike me as totally your vibe, but you never know.</strong></p>
<p id="0kjNlY">No, it’s not really my vibe. And a lot of that just has to do with the idea that you need to be making something that is of a piece of a very large entity with a lot of history, and a lot of relationships that people are already bringing to the characters, into the worlds. For that reason, I’m not sure I’d be the best candidate for that kind of work, but never say never, I guess.</p>
<p id="ZJlTAU"><strong>You’re in this really interesting space with both TV and movie opportunities. Where’s your focus next, and what do you see yourself moving toward?</strong></p>
<p id="eL9BEP">I need to be making personal movies again. That’s where I really learn and flex and experiment and fail and try and all of it, you know. So that’s what’s next for me, is just figuring out what the next feature is going to be. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2s-best-boons-practically-break-the-game/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hades-2s-best-boons-practically-break-the-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Clearing runs in <em>Hades 2</em> relies on you mixing and matching boons and weapons. You need to think about how these things synergize to create a Time-stopping build. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-boons-for-each-god-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best boons in <em>Hades 2</em></a> don’t need outside help; they pretty much break the game on their own.</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">As it is with many newly launched games, <em>Hades 2</em> is no outlier to busted items. The game is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Early Access</a>, so it’s likely we’ll see buffs and nerfs to weapons, items, boons, and other upgrades while it’s in development. But until then, there are a few boons you should seek out before they’re changed (<em>if </em>they get changed). </p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-break-hades-2-with-the-best-overpowered-boons" data-injectable="false">How to break <em>Hades 2</em> with the best-overpowered boons</h2> <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true">Poseidon offers one of my favorite boons in the game merely due to its game-breaking potential. And it’s not alone in that category. As also spotted by others in the community, several boons completely break Hades 2 at nearly no penalty at all. We’re talking boons that give you free items, nearly unlimited Magick, and invulnerability to projectiles. If you’ve been struggling against the ravages of Time, consider these god-like boons as options.</p>
 <h3 id="h-poseidon-double-up" data-injectable="false">Poseidon – Double Up</h3> <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">As hinted earlier, Poseidon’s best boon in <em>Hades 2</em> is Double Up. It doesn’t increase your damage… at least not directly. Damp uncle’s most useful boon has a chance to create a duplicate of a “Minor Find” — items such as Gold Crowns, Psyche, and Ash. But did you know <strong>it also counts toward Poms of Power and <em>Gifts of the Moon</em></strong>? Selene’s boons seem minor at first, but the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-path-of-stars-and-upgrades-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Stars can make you powerful</a> or temporarily invulnerable with the right upgrades. Having double the points for upgrades is nothing to turn your nose at.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">The duplication effect isn’t a rare occurrence, either. <strong>At its base rarity, the boon has a 25% chance to double an award</strong>. It rises to <em>30%</em> at the next level up. That’s a duped item practically one out of every three times, all for free. Can you imagine what’s possible with a triple Pom? </p>
 <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false"><strong>To increase your odds of getting the boon, use <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-keepsakes-in-hades-2-and-how-to-get-them-nectar-gift-guide/#1-best-keepsakes-in-hades-2-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poseidon’s Keepsake</a> ‘Vivid Sea’</strong>. Hell, I’d suggest hunting down the boon just to hear Poseidon’s fantastic laugh whenever it procs. </p> <h3 id="h-hestia-soot-sprint" data-injectable="false">Hestia – Soot Sprint</h3> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">Soot Sprint is easily the most useful boon gifted by the goddess Hestia. When taken, the boon destroys all nearby projectiles as you sprint while inflicting the Scorch curse on the enemies that fired. Perhaps that doesn’t sound too fantastic at first since Scorch isn’t exactly the most impressive curse. But <strong>Soot Sprint deletes all damaging projectiles near Melinoe as she sprints while damaging foes, <em>all for free</em></strong>. There is no Magick needed to prime for Soot Sprint to do its thing; you run, and projectiles are erased just like that.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">For those who have it rough in Oceanus, Soot Sprint is a godsend. Well, literally, I guess. Fellow enjoyers of the original <em>Hades </em>still sing the praises of Athena’s Divine Dash, her best boon, which gave you invulnerability and reflection on dash. Soot Sprint is just as good, and arguably better, as it lasts for as long as you hold the sprint button down. </p>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false"><strong>If you want to give Soot Sprint a chance, you can improve your odds of getting it by equipping Hestia’s Keepsake ‘Everlasting Ember’</strong>. </p> <h3 id="h-hera-born-gain" data-injectable="false">Hera – Born Gain</h3> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><strong>Hera’s Born Gain boon gives you almost unlimited Magick</strong>. No, that’s not hyperbole. Every time you reach zero Magick, your Magick bar is restored with the caveat of having a small amount permanently primed. By primed, I mean a small portion of your Magick meter is reduced. Some boons prime Magick to be used, which means you’ll need to weigh the positives and negatives of having a reduced bar. Usually, that means giving up several dozen Magick points. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="591" data-current-count="891" data-injectable="true">Born Gain, though, uses ten at its most basic rarity. Yes, <em>ten</em>. It takes even less as it levels up. At Epic, it only primes six Magick. If you’re rocking more than 150 Magick before taking the gift, this is a laughable penalty. And it can go lower. If you’re equipped with Poseidon’s Fluid Gain, which drops a bubble that replenishes a small amount of Magick, or the Arcana Card ‘The Unseen’, which passively restores Magick, Born Again’s caveat becomes inconsequential. Keep grabbing Soul Tonics as you see them, and you’ll never run dry of Magick.</p>
 <p data-characters="94" data-current-count="94" data-injectable="false"><strong>To up the odds of getting Born Gain, equip Hera’s Keepsake ‘Iridescent Fan</strong>‘.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-%E2%80%93-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions.881850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The best Electro main DPS in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/">Wuthering Waves</a></em>, Calcharo sets himself apart through his ability to obliterate enemies while in his Deathblade Gear state. He also has one of the most fun, albeit technical, playstyles in the game, given his reliance on mix-ups. </p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">But even after considering the above, you will still need to make use of a tailor-made team and build for him to shine in the late game. Here’s the best Calcharo build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, as well as a team sure to allow him to showcase all of his might. </p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-calcharo" data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Calcharo</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">The best weapon for Calcharo in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan’s</a> signature 5-star Verdant Summit. The weapon excels by providing him with a 12% boost in Electro DMG and a total of 48.6% Crit DMG —the latter when at level 90. The 5-star will also allow you to strengthen the damage of his Mercy Heavy Attack by up to 48%. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">If our top pick is not an option for you, my main alternative will be the also 5-star Lustrous Razor. The weapon will provide Calcharo with both a handy amount of ER and a massive amount of ATK. Lustrous Razor also allows him to get an extra 14% boost in Resonance Liberation DMG by performing his Skill twice. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best 4-Star Alternatives </h3> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">My main 4-star pick for Calcharo is the Battle-Pass exclusive Autumntrace. The weapon will offer him both a 20% increase in Crit Rate at level 90 and an easy-to-trigger up to 20% ATK buff. For those not planning on getting the Premium Pass, Helios Cleaver will be my main pick, given its high ATK value and focused buff.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Calcharo in Wuthering Waves </h2> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">As you might have guessed, the best Sonata for Calcharo is a 5-piece Void Thunder. When equipped, the set will offer a permanent 10% Electro DMG buff and allow him to get another 15% by performing his Resonance Skill. The buff triggered by the Skill will last 15 seconds and can stack two times to a total of 30%. </p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">For the echoes, I recommend using either Thundering Mephis or Tempest Mephis as your main in a one Overlord, two Common, and two Elites composition. Although Thundering’s moveset is more to my liking, both echoes will buff Calcharo’s Electro and Liberation DMG by 12% after being used. The buff will last 15 seconds. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Best Stas and Substats</h3> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">Main stat-wise, I recommend that you invest in Crit Rate above all else. This is vital, as Calcharo’s low attack speed while in his regular state will demand it. For the remaining stats, focus on Electro DMG and ATK in equal measure. Crit Rate, Crit DMG, Energy Regen, and ATK will be my substat picks. Make sure to get his Crit Rate to around 60% for optimal damage. </p>
 <p data-characters="89" data-current-count="89" data-injectable="false">To recap, here are the best echoes for Calcharo, as well as our recommended main stats. </p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Echo Tier / Cost</th><th data-align="center">Echo Pick</th><th data-align="center">Ideal Main Stat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Overlord / 4</td><td data-align="center">Thundering Mephis / Tempest Mephis</td><td data-align="center">Crit Rate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elite / 3</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elite / 3</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG &gt; ATK%</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Common / 1</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">ATK%</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Common / 1</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">ATK%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Calcharo Team Compositions</h2> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">The best team for Calcharo in<em> Wuthering Waves </em>will feature him as its main DPS, Jianxin as its sub-DPS/main support, and Verina as its healer. Jianxin is vital here, given her ability to offer a 14-second 38%&nbsp;Resonance Liberation DMG Deepen buff through her Outro Skill. We will then have in Verina both all the healing we might need and the ability to resurrect party members.</p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">Using Sanhua in the sub-DPS role can also work, as she can offer a 38% Basic Attack DMG Deepen boost. If you don’t have Verina, Baizhi can also excel. You will have to raise her to R5 to unlock the ability to revive, though.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">If her kit remains unchanged, Yinlin will become the best pick for the sub-DPS/support role by a large margin. The reason for that lies in her Outro Skill’s ability to buff Calcharo’s Electro DMG by 20% and Liberation DMG by 25%. Luckily we won’t have to wait too much for her to debut, as she will be the star of the game’s second character-focused banner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-has-won-its-landmark-destiny-2-cheating-case-against-aimjunkies-phoenix-digital-what-now/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bungie-has-won-its-landmark-destiny-2-cheating-case-against-aimjunkies-phoenix-digital-what-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="280" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Bungie has finally won its lawsuit against Aimjunkies/Phoenix Digital, a company that made cheats for games like <em>Destiny 2</em>. The case initially saw Bungie sue the companies for terms of service, but the case took a wild turn after the accused turned around and countersued Bungie. </p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Game File journalist <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794154042190700617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1794154042190700617%7Ctwgr%5Eb5746c6dcb14637c50df3410a871a4fbf48ce133%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1czyyan%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo</a> broke the story, revealing Bungie’s win, which amounts to $63,210 in damages. The real win, though, is the precedent this case sets. Other devs can now point to a case where a jury has voted in favor of a game developer regarding cheats being made for their games. </p> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Though the win was in Bungie’s favor, the case wasn’t without its twists. James May, who Bungie alleged it caught reverse-engineering <em>Destiny 2</em> to make cheats, claimed that he didn’t infringe Bungie’s copyright. Instead, he claimed Bungie infringed his by snooping on his computer. In reality, Bungie has the right, as per <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s terms of service, to use certain methods to detect if you’re using cheat software. </p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Following the loss, Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer insists he’s going to fight this decision. His first move will be a move to dismiss the verdict, followed by an appeal if that fails. </p> <figure data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-landmark-destiny-2-cheating-lawsuit-isn-t-the-first-of-its-kind-and-it-won-t-be-the-last" data-injectable="false">Landmark Destiny 2 cheating lawsuit isn’t the first of its kind – and it won’t be the last</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">While this case might be the first of its kind that a jury has voted on, it’s not the first time a game developer or publisher has won a lawsuit against companies making cheats. As pointed out by Totilo in a separate <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794215661226651904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, “Game companies have been getting default rulings against cheat-makers for years, often with giant, multi-million-$ awards. This was the rare case where cheat-makers pushed back, said their actions weren’t illegal and it was left for a jury to decide.”</p>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">Bungie, who says it has spent millions directly combatting cheats in <em>Destiny 2</em> and has received numerous complaints about in-game cheats over the years, has been battling Aimjunkies/Phoenix Digital since mid-2021. The developer sued for $65,000, which is how much it estimated Aimjunkies made from <em>Destiny 2</em> cheats, but that’s nothing compared to the millions spent on anti-cheat measures. </p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">The outcome of this case is likely to have reaching implications about how such a lawsuit can be applied in the future. Because this was a jury trial, it can be considered precedent for saying that such cheats infringe on a developer or publisher’s copyright. </p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">Bungie has been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-awarded-12-million-in-latest-destiny-2-cheat-seller-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting cheaters for years</a> but cheats inevitably pop up once a game is popular enough, aiming to give those willing to pay an unfair edge. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="false">With <em>Destiny 2</em> set to receive much less support in terms of new content once <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Final Shape</a></em> has been released, you have to wonder if Bungie will put the energy and money into a lawsuit like this again. Regardless, it’s a good note to end the game’s legal journey on if that’s what this is. </p>

 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUA7RoEONQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full ViDoc</a> is very much worth a watch if you’re excited about the final expansion for <em>Destiny 2</em>. All you need to hear has been cut and put together by <a href="https://x.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1793677260643508265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny Bulletin on Twitter</a>, though, in case you can’t wait to hear what our new Zavalla sounds like. </p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Lance Reddick was one of the greatest and most prolific actors of our time. A quick check of his IMDB profile shows 121 actor credits, 4 as a producer, and 2 on soundtracks. His voice was fantastic, the perfect blend of depth, attitude, and emotion, allowing him to fit easily into incredibly serious roles by bringing a level of authority to any situation that you simply understood without context. </p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">When Reddick spoke, you listened, and that’s a hard act to follow. From what we’ve heard from him so far, Keith David isn’t going all in on replicating Reddick’s voice as closely as possible. Instead, he’s bringing to the table what his predecessor did. Raw emotion, depth, attitude, and that same authority that you obey without question because you know this man is asking you to saunter up to the gates of hell for the fight of your life for a reason. </p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s expansions and seasons have always been pocketed with emotional crescendos. The opening to <em>The Taken King</em>, <em>Rise of Iron</em>‘s tale of the ultimate warriors sacrificing themselves, reconnecting with Rasputin in <em>Warmind</em>, and, more recently, seeing Crow become a heroic character after falling so hard from grace and Eris Morn take one for the team as the most badass witch in the galaxy. </p>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">Commander Zavalla may not always have been the focal point of these stories, but he has been a stronghold when the game cracks our steely Guardian exteriors and forces us to remember that not everyone is going to come back from death. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="false">Handling that kind of role is a huge amount of pressure. In the two clips we’ve seen, though, David demonstrates both a vulnerable Zavalla, and the strong, commanding voice we often need him to be. There’s no doubt in my mind that he’ll be the perfect Zavalla come <em>The Final Shape</em>. Not because of any one particular thing his voice portrays but because of how it embodies the unbreakable pillar of <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>

            <p>Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has opened up about crunch culture at the studio, acknowledging that the team did, at times, "have to do a bit of crunch" when "things happened that [the studio] didn't foresee".</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A Vincke hosted after his address at the Digital Dragons conference in Poland, Vincke was asked if the team ever had to crunch – that is, the term given to the extreme overtime studios compel staff to do to get a game ready for its release date – and whilst Vincke said the team wasn't "overly" required to crunch, and it was "certainly less on BG3 than we did in the past", "It would be a lie to say that we didn't" crunch at all.</p>

<p>"We didn't overly crunch," Vincke said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GR+</a>). "but we did have to do a bit of crunch. And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p>
<p>Vincke further added that anyone who had to work late was paid for their overtime – many studios purportedly do not – and only "very, very, very rarely" would people work over the weekend or past 8pm at night.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios shared the "disappointing news" that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-xbox-physical-edition-gets-a-bit-of-a-delay-due-to-production-issues">physical PS5 North America deluxe editions have been delayed once again</a>, this time to July 2024.</p>
<p>Larian also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything else to do with Dungeons and Dragons… but it did tease that it had other games in development.</p>

It’s one thing to make space look good; it’s another thing entirely to faithfully recreate the cockpit of a 747 and the whole world around which it might fly.</p><p>On&nbsp;<a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of&nbsp;<em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;the fourth and final installment of our series on the five senses of video games, we asked <em>Polygon’s </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/authors/charlie-hall">Charlie Hall</a> to help us make sense of the current state of the art in flight simulation. Hall, who once spent more than four months in VR <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/14/18182580/elite-dangerous-distant-worlds-2-waypoints-sign-ups">mapping the edge of the Milky Way galaxy in <em>Elite: Dangerous</em></a>, has more experience in a virtual cockpit than most. We wanted to know how the pros set up their simulators to get the most realistic experience and why it’s so complicated to make a virtual world look like the real one.</p><p>Hall makes the case that while VR and XR headsets hold a lot of promise for even more realistic experiences in the future, the best virtual cockpits of today are still made up of multi-monitor setups and power-hungry GPUs. That’s true whether you’re playing in your house or you’re running the official <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil/news/Navy-and-Air-Force-fighters-train-joint-force-NAWCADs-Joint-Simulation-Environment/Tue">F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning simulators</a> at the US Air Force.

WB Games’ crossover platform fighter dropped in Open Beta in 2022, and the plan at the time seemed to be a smooth transition to a full launch. Instead the game was temporarily shut down, despite having run multiple Battle Passes and taking real money for skins and other cosmetics. Several months later, a relaunch is right around the corner with 1.0 scheduled for May 28, 2024. So, what happens to all that purchased content, and would there be any compensation for those founding players when <em>MultiVersus</em> returned?

    </div><div>



            <p>2K is rumoured to have secured the official FIFA license to develop the next FIFA game.</p>
<p>That's according to unverified claims from retailer <a href="https://x.com/mohplay_inc_">@mohplay_inc_</a>, which alleges that "the partnership is confirmed, and 2K will be developing a new football game series", albeit without sharing their source.</p>

<p>The news has been received with excitement, alarm, and scepticism in equal measure, not least because the leaker claims "FIFA 2K25 is set to launch this year, just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2K26!", which seems an incredibly quick turnaround.</p>
<p>Others are just delighted at the prospect of EA's football series having competition beyond Konami's eFootball franchise, which secured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/efootball-2022-season-1-review-too-little-too-late">an Avoid in our review</a> when it first released back in 2022.</p>

</span></p><p>EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher was keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it, announcing that this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-trumpets-11m-players-in-first-week-1m-more-than-fifa-23">EA Sports FC 24, reached 11.3m players in its first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>That's compared to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-23-had-series-largest-ever-number-of-players-at-launch">10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23</a> during the same period - a figure EA referred to as "record-breaking" and the "biggest launch period" in the franchise's history at the time.</p>
<p>EA Sports FC launched for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch at the end of September, earning itself 3 out of 5 stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-review-sensible-changes-and-disappointing-constants">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC review</a>. "There are improvements, and there are problems, business as usual," contributor Josh Wise wrote. "The era of EA Sports' FIFA may be over, but the game goes on."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-delayed-to-second-half-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2</a> was arguably the star of the recent Warhammer Skulls 2024 live stream. The long-awaited sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-maine-2-co-op-operations-mode-6v6-pvp-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off the multiplayer modes</a> available in the final release: the PvE Operations mode, which runs parallel to the co-op enabled campaign, where you'll play as your own customized Space Marine and work as a team to defeat various Xeno abominations; and the PvP Eternal War mode, where Chaos and Empire will once again clash with chainswords in intense 6v6 multiplayer battles.</p>
<p>In both modes, players will pick between six multiplayer classes with very different gameplay. By playing them, they’ll be able to upgrade these classes with different perks and customize their armor from helm to greaves, with a wide selection of cosmetic elements, such as colors, heraldry decals, pauldrons, gauntlets, and more.&nbsp;On that note, publisher Focus Home Interactive later <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1794020543798427832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a clarification</a> that will probably make many fans happy:</p>
<ul>
<li>There aren't any microtransactions in Space Marine 2. No in-game cash shop.</li>
<li>All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Paid DLCs will be cosmetic only.</li>
</ul>
<p>The six multiplayer classes are Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper, and Heavy. The classes are similar but not quite all the same compared to the original game, which included Tactical, Assault, Devastator, Raptor, Dreadnought, and Havoc.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. All pre-orders will receive the Macragge's Chosen cosmetic DLC, which includes the Ultramarines-inspired skin set for the bolt rifle, the chainsword, and the Crux Terminatus pauldron.</p>

<p>The Gold Edition, priced at $89.99 on PC and $99.99 on consoles, also provides four days of early access (meaning players would start playing on September 5 instead of 9) and the Season Pass, which will revolve around cosmetics. The $99.99 (on PC; $109.99 on consoles) digital-only Ultra Edition adds the Ultramarines Champion Pack with two unique cosmetics for your Heavy Bolter and Power Armour. Finally, the $249.99 Collector's Edition also includes the Collector’s Case with unique artwork, a finely painted and detailed 8.25 x 6.7" resin statue of protagonist Lieutenant Titus (with two interchangeable heads: with and without the helmet), the game’s official Steelbook, and the 172-page book 'The Art and Making of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2'.</p>

  <p id="Ig3jIz">It’s been decades since games started implementing in-game communication devices that resemble our own real-life phones — and it’s often a successful mechanic for separating and consolidating menus, as well as tracking progress. But recently, I’ve noticed a weird trend: mobile games that are set entirely inside of a simulated mobile device. In other words, phone games where playing them feels like being on your phone. And frankly, I’m over it.</p>
<p id="HLrYqP">Take <em>Guildlings</em>, the very cute turn-based RPG. The game opens with you, a character named Coda, discovering your magical phone (also called a Tome). The phone comes with a purple fairy-like wisp that acts sort of like your avatar to move about the world — when your Tome brings you to new places in Worldaria, you’ll use your wisp to control Guildlings (aka wizards) through battles and exploration. </p>

<p id="WvF9te">The game eventually transitions into these more complex interactions — you can move around, investigate with different items, recruit new Guildlings, and ultimately battle other wisps and wizards — but for the first 15 minutes or so, you’re basically just using a text-like chat on your magical phone to make foundational decisions. It’s... frustrating. And it doesn’t do justice to the game’s otherwise decent gameplay.</p>
<p id="pEbTjq">This chat system carries on throughout the game, and its clunkiness probably doesn’t bother most players. But my patience for my real-life phone is wearing thin, because at this point this thing is more tool and less gadget. When I play a game on it, I want to forget how annoying my phone is to use. Instead, I’m often met — particularly at the outset of a game — with a UI that vaguely imitates the UI of my real phone, but with fewer decisions and less control.</p>
<p id="nraG3G">There are plenty of titles that successfully pull off the design of an in-game phone. Nearly every mystery game I’ve played includes a phone, and it’s not the most exciting part of the game, but it’s often unobtrusive — you usually get notifications triggered by location or plot, and you otherwise don’t need to use the faux phone. In <em>Guildlings</em>, the game <em>is</em> the phone, and for that reason, I have to really try to get into it. Moreover, it’s not the only instance of a clunky phone-within-a-phone game I’ve found.</p>
<p id="nrJpg7">In-game texts in particular feel a bit tired, since this format is ostensibly a much easier way to design game conversations than animating several characters speaking to one another. <em>An Elmwood Trail</em> is an example of this. The game is well written and decently interesting, but it’s primarily set inside faux iPhones that only give you two options for each text you send. For a game, that’s predictable — but for a phone, it’s extremely limiting.</p>

<p id="YVBMjo">In the opening scenes of <em>Elmwood</em>, you’re a detective choosing responses to send to an unknown number that’s trying to blackmail you into solving a case. The conversation is fine, but it ends up being a miss for me because I don’t find it fun to wait for someone to respond to my text. I also wish I could choose between more than two options — we know the technology is out there to put in our own responses and let the game digest and decide what happens next based on keywords we send (looking at you, <em>Scribblenauts</em>). I realize that type of game would be much more laborious to create, write, and design. But something in between the two would be wondrous.</p>
<p id="DEDppo">As <em>Elmwood</em> progresses, you’ll gather other evidence to investigate, and one of the first pieces is another character’s phone. This device has some impressive nuggets of detail that should be celebrated: emails that contain clues, photos of the character’s cat, a Pixabowl (aka Instagram) app.</p>
<p id="XWUJQQ">But this setup falls short for me because it all so closely resembles my real-life phone that it’s almost stressful. Maybe a younger audience finds this <em>more</em> alluring than a game without phones. Ultimately, I’ve found myself wishing developers wouldn’t rely so much on a watered-down version of a real-life item that can do everything to tell their stories. </p>
<p id="Hoa0XH">In <em>Elmwood</em>, eventually you can interact with items on your desk in addition to your device-based evidence. I don’t want to punch down at this game outright, because holistically it isn’t bad — but I do think there’s something uninspired about using incoming texts and calls to introduce the story. Further, I think there’s much more interesting commentary about phones and metagaming to be had. </p>

<p id="BMUnZ5"><em>Reigns</em> is an example of a game that uses elements of smartphone-like UI, but these elements are so piecemeal that the experience is still really enjoyable. Using the “swipe left for no, swipe right for yes” format of lots of dating apps, the game leads you through binary decisions that extend or truncate your reign as king. You can read it a bit as commentary on the way we use dating apps (er, the way <em>you</em> use dating apps — I’m married) — don’t think, just swipe. The game even prompts players to slow down and read to fully understand the implications of their decisions, which sounds like advice plenty of my friends who use dating apps could stand to internalize.</p>

<p id="QVZmyZ">There’s also <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, the steamy RPG with turn-based battles — and a superpower in-game phone. The (very good, very fun) game takes place outside of the device, which is only used for communications between characters and tracking missions. <em>Honkai</em> accomplishes something I haven’t seen elsewhere: The phone UI in this game is better than my real phone. It’s faster with sleeker design and intuitive menus, along with cheeky texts that come as delightful surprises rather than obtrusive notifications.</p>
<p id="Pm6KQR">I’d be a fool to think phones in games are going anywhere, and really, I don’t want them to. But I’m genuinely more enthused by mobile games that create a version of my phone that’s <em>more</em> exciting than the one I use all day every day. Particularly since modern phones are lightning-fast and virtually ubiquitous, I enjoy playing games that synthesize or critique our real-life use of our smartphones rather than replicate it. </p>

        <p>Not a bad overall selection by any means.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Chillblast has just announced a new range of pre-built gaming PCs that aim to provide good all-round specs, beefy performance and fantastic aesthetics for what are generally decent prices. Named Edge, this range of three new PCs hits the mid-range, upper-mid-range and absolute top end of the market in generally compelling packages that you may well want to consider.</p>
<h2>Chillblast Karve</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/cb-karve.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For most people, the Karve (from <a href="https://chillblast.sjv.io/R5MjAy" rel="sponsored noopener" target="_blank">£1,449.95</a>) is likely to be a good choice, pairing a six core &amp; 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, a derivative of one of our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-gaming-cpu-top-amd-intel-processors-for-your-next-build#bestbudgetAMD">favourite budget CPUs</a> with an RTX 4060 Ti to offer a system that should muster 1080p HFR gaming, and push into 1440p. Elsewhere, this PC also doesn't skimp on components with a 240mm AIO for cooling the 5600X, as well as offering a 2TB Crucial P3 Plus inside for storage, which is an excellent PCIe 4.0 SSD in a good capacity, 16GB of DDR4-3200 RAM, and an 80+ Gold-rated Corsair RMe 750W PSU for powering the system. The 4060 Ti inside is also vertically mounted for better aesthetics, which goes hand in hand with the white case that the Karve comes in.</p>
<h2>Chillblast Vantage</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/cb-vantage-copy.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Going up the price ladder, the Vantage (from <a href="https://chillblast.sjv.io/y2X3ay" rel="sponsored noopener" target="_blank">£2,029.99</a>) swaps to using a Hyte Y60 case, which is in-keeping with the trendier angle Chillblast is going for with these new PCs, and packs in Intel's marvellous i5-14600K CPU with 14 cores and 20 threads. This is a CPU that, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-intel-core-i9-14900k-core-i5-14600k-review?page=5">our testing</a>, offers strong performance in content creation workloads, and while it isn't as impressive as AMD's -X3D chips for gaming, it's still more than competent. This is paired with an RTX 4070 Super, which is the best of Nvidia's Super refresh of cards, and offers fantastic results at 1440p with RT on demanding titles such as Cyberpunk 2077, as we noted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review">our review</a>. The Vantage uses the same Crucial P3 Plus 2TB NVMe drive, adds in 32GB of DDR5-5600 CL40 RAM, and opts to up the PSU to an 850W 80+ Gold Corsair RMe option. The 14600K is cooled by a 360mm AIO this time, while the 4070 Super is also vertically mounted, too.</p>
<h2>Chillblast Verge</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/cb-verge.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And if you're quite frankly insane, then there's the Verge (from <a href="https://chillblast.sjv.io/m5P3LZ" rel="sponsored noopener" target="_blank">£5,709.95</a>), which makes for one of the most ridiculous PCs money can buy today. It goes all-out with its spec sheet, pairing Intel's flagship i9-14900KF and its 24 cores and 32 thread combo with a water cooled RTX 4090. That's no expense spared, then! The 14-900KF is one of the best processors for content creation workloads and offers excellent gaming performance, too, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-extreme-performance">RTX 4090</a> remains unmatched in its power for 4K ray-traced gaming. It maintains the same DDR5-5600 CL40 RAM as the Vantage, but doubles the capacity to 64GB,  and upgrades the SSD to a 2TB Kingston Fury Renegade option, which offers quicker reads and writes and better random speeds than the Crucial P3 Plus, making it an excellent choice for intensive workloads. Moreover, the Verge also comes with a custom water loop with a 360mm radiator, as well as a beefy 1000W 80+ Gold rated Corsair RMe PSU. It also provides a trendy Hyte Y60 case, complete with a screen on the corner side panel so you can check vital temperatures and system utilisation, or display silly messages - whatever floats your boat.</p>
<p>So, there you have it - that's Chillblast's new range of Edge gaming PCs, which are some fantastic looking choices if you want a new PC for content creation or gaming workloads without the hassle or frightening experience of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-jumping-in-at-the-deep-end-the-truths-of-building-a-high-spec-gaming-pc-as-a-first-build">building a high-spec one yourself</a>.</p>
