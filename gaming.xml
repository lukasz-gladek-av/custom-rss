            <p>
Pokémon Go has dropped a gigantic hint it will add Gen 8's game-changing Dynamax mechanic in the not-too-distant future. 
</p>
<p>
The tease, which takes centre stage in the game's new 8th Anniversary artwork, shows a Dynamaxed Wartortle alongside the eight generation's trio of Starter Pokémon: Grooky, Scorbunny and Sobble. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka suggested to Eurogamer</a> that a long-awaited release of the franchise's eighth generation would come with a focus on "what makes those Pokémon special".

<p>
Pokémon Go has so far largely skipped over the launch of Gen 8 species to focus more on Gen 9 critters from the more recent Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 
</p>
<p>
Now, fans are clamouring for the game to get back to filling out its Gen 8 Pokédex - and this year's anniversary artwork appears to suggest it will do just this. 
</p>
<p>
"We've definitely been thinking a lot about Gen 8 for a while in Pokémon Go," Steranka told me last month. "Nothing to share right now in terms of the timing or launch strategy there, but something we're always trying to do is play homage to the source material and do right by that source material.
</p>
<p>
"Know that as the team is thinking about Gen 8 Pokémon, they're thinking about Galar, they're thinking about what makes those Pokémon special, and when it's time for them to make their debut in Pokémon Go, it will make sense."
</p>
<p>
A fair word of caution - Pokémon Go's anniversary artwork often teases unreleased Pokémon species and characters that still take months, if not years, to arrive. In some cases, players are still waiting for things like Mega Mewtwo (teased three years back). 
</p>
<p>
"Sometimes in that there's a bit of a peer into the future beyond that year and sometimes it might be a little bit more aspirational than we're ready to go for," Steranka told me, discussing the anniversary artwork teases. "So I wouldn't look to that as a definitive roadmap of any given year in Pokémon Go. Instead, it's something we're excited about and almost like a creative vision for where we would generally like the game to go in the future, but not as a one-to-one of what's to come."
</p>
<p>
Plans change, in other words - but this year's giant signal Dynamax is on the radar seems fairly definitive. 
</p>
<p>
For the unitiated, Pokémon capable of Dynamax can grow in size (not unlike Pokémon Go's raid bosses currently) and use more powerful Max Moves. 
</p>
<p>
On top of this, there's a separate Gigantamax system which grants even more powerful G-Max Moves and gives creatures a whole new appearance. Pokémon Go fans have suggested this could get added to the game with a similar system to its current Mega Evolution mechanic. 
</p>
<p>
In the nearer future, Pokémon Go is set to celebrate its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-to-be-adding-fuse-mechanic-as-necrozma-confirmed-for-go-fest">annual Go Fest Global this coming weekend</a>, with the arrival of Mythical Pokémon Marshadow and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-waited-until-yesterdays-eclipse-to-announce-necrozmas-arrival">Necrozma</a> for all players.

            <p>
An issue with Final Fantasy 14 on Xbox is still not resolved, despite maintenance over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
Director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Naoki Yoshida last week offered his "sincere apologies"</a> for issues discovered in new expansion Dawntrail, including transition freezes on Xbox.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday the game was down for maintenance and, in a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/f6cdae7e7a04944478ae628ee52511a0eb3f3a90">follow up post</a>, Square Enix noted it had "taken preliminary steps" to address the issue but it's still not fixed.

<p>

"We have taken several measures that we anticipate will effectively address the memory fragmentation issue we previously identified," reads the post with regards to the game becoming unresponsive when transitioning between areas on Xbox consoles.
</p>
<p>
"Despite our ongoing investigation into the matter with the assistance of Microsoft, the issue persists in some of our development environments.
</p>
<p>
"Our current progress involves rigorous testing of each potential cause of the issue and verifying the impact of each measure. However, it is highly likely that it will take time to fully uncover and address the issue, so we have applied a version of the process that we believe may be effective to the public servers. Therefore, while we have not yet received the final confirmation that the issue has been fully addressed, we will continue to monitor the situation in the public environment after the patch has been applied."
</p>
<p>
If additional time is required to resolve the issue, Square Enix will consider extending <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/5f736b6fea2b84d97fa617b3399d12a5dff797e5">free game time to those affected</a>.

</p>
<p>
Other issues were fully addressed during maintenance, including certain animations not displaying properly. This, amusingly, included the Eat Pizza emote becoming distorted with a certain male Au Ra face type.

In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909">previous blog post</a>, Yoshida stated Final Fantasy 14 has reached "a record number of concurrent users" not seen since the release of A Realm Reborn in 2013.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously spoke to Yoshida during a Dawntrail preview in which he stated there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-no-chance-of-final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-launch-server-woes-naoki-yoshida-says-after-endwalker-issues">"almost no chance" of server congestion for the expansion's launch</a>. He added that should access be smooth, it's not due to a drop in players but the use of so many new servers. The high concurrent players are testament to that.
</p>
<p>
Recently, a report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">Square Enix is developing a mobile version</a> of its MMORPG along with Tencent.

The feature lets users control RGB lights using the open HID LampArray standard, and manufacturers like Acer, Asus, HP, HyperX, Logitech, Razer, and Twinkly have all partnered with Microsoft to support this.</p><p>The Dynamic Lighting support on Asus’ latest motherboards requires a BIOS update that should be available in the coming weeks. A beta version is available right now from Asus’ forums for <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/amd-600-series/x670-resource/m-p/1026026/highlight/true#M6656">AMD</a> and <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/intel-700-600-series/raptorlake-resources/m-p/1024858/highlight/true#M23638">Intel</a> boards, but I wouldn’t recommend flashing a beta BIOS unless you’re happy to restore an older BIOS version if you run into bugs.</p><p>Once your Asus board supports Dynamic Lighting you can then manage the brightness, colors, and effects in the Settings section of Windows 11. The lighting controls are fairly basic right now, but at least you can avoid Asus’ Armory Crate tool and use native RGB controls in Windows. This also means you don’t have to use third-party RGB controller software&nbsp;<a href="https://openrgb.org/">like OpenRGB</a> either, unless you need the extra functionality it provides.</p><p>The Intel Z790 beta BIOS updates even include the microcode update that should help with some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">Intel’s game crashing issues</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While the actual races themselves were created by the modders - “from scratch based on CDPR's writing” -  all the writing and audio used was found in the game files. So conversations, characters, journal entries, and even quest board notices all appear in the mod as they would have in the game. You’ll kick off the races at Novigrad, after which you’ll choose to sail for either the city or Redania. There’s four tournaments in all. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-3-tips">The Witcher 3</a>’s boats were never particularly exciting, but there’s plenty of conversations between quests to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>This is the latest cut content discovery made since modding tool <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-redkit-mod-tools-launch-may-21st-enabling-a-new-era-of-ambitious-overhauls">REDKit</a>’s release. Modders recently found a big chunk of ending on the cutting room floor, including a scene in which Yennefer betrayed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modders-uncover-a-last-minute-yennefer-betrayal-in-the-witcher-3-cut-content">Lodge Of Sorceresses</a>. I’m left wondering if we’ll ever get to see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-was-going-to-include-ice-skating-but-it-was-cut">famous ice skating swordfights</a> that were prototyped but ultimately abandoned, although it doesn’t sound like they got far enough to leave any trace in the files. Book readers will know that violent ice skating isn’t new territory for the series, but the developers ultimately felt that introducing a new system so late in the game was “quite wonky.” Embrace wonkiness, say I. Until then, why not have a glance at our best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3 mods</a>. At this rate, though, they’ll surely be needing an update soon.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, everybody? Following last week's slight (and perhaps slightly editorialised) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-1">dry spell</a>, there is a non-zero quantity of promising new PC games in the offing, and they cover a nice spread of genres.</p> <!--more-->
<p>On Tuesday 9th July, we've got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/">Once Human</a>, a free-to-play multiplayer open world survival shooter set in a world polluted by sanity-eroding Stardust. On Wednesday 10th July, there's the early access launch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2776500/Time_Treker/">Time Treker</a> (sic), aka Vampire Survivor but with anime mecha. Thursday 11th July unleashes the first-person stomping of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/">Anger Foot</a>, and the Viva Pinata-adjacent gardening thrills of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928540/Horticular/">Horticular</a>. And on Friday 12th July, the SNES-style horror maze running of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193720/Super_Dark_Deception/">Super Dark Deception</a>, the cyberpunk deck-building of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2181950/Zero_Division/">Zero Division</a>, and the fungal-fingered scholarship of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536570/The_Last_Alchemist/">The Last Alchemist</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, you can keep track of the latest developments in the tumultuous realm of PC gaming via the liveblog below, and make vicious jokes about our puns in the attached comments thread. Also as ever, the liveblog is sponsored by the Maw, the reeking, raging embodiment of the endless hunger for News, whose million lamprey gullets we strive ever to fill with, as the case may be, articles about dogs in Zenless Zone Zero, or people getting mad at Call of Duty.

    <p>On a similar note, Ubisoft executive producer Mark Rubin has responded to complaints that XDefiant is rather buggy right now, commenting that unlike Call Of Duty (one of Rubin's previous gigs), the new game has been made using an engine that isn't designed for first-person shooting.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rushed out? No. What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO.

    Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tim-hooded-horse_manor-lords-is-a-pretty-interesting-case-study-activity-7215509660999503874-5CO0/">objected at length</a> to Hinterland CEO's Raphael van Lierop characterising Hooded Horse's city builder Manor Lords as "a pretty interesting case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access development". In his LinkedIn post, Van Lierop comments that the game hasn't been updated significantly since it topped charts at launch. "Early Access is a marathon, and when you launch you need to have your next major content expansion pretty much in the queue," he writes. Bender's take is that "this is exactly the kind of distorted endless growth/burden of expectations/line must go up perspective that causes so much trouble in the games industry."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/godot-engine-creator-will-go-with-full-path-tracing-instead-of-a-lumen-like-hybrid-nanite-like-system-not-planned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The free cross-platform open-source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot</a> game-making engine has been around for over ten years now. Created by Argentinian developers Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur, it has been used so far by indie developers in games like Deponia, The Case of the Golden Idol, Cassette Beasts, Brotato, and the upcoming Slay the Spire 2. Perhaps the highest-profile game made with Godot was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-colors-ultimate-new-sonic-team-game-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a>, developed by Blind Squirrel Games.</p>
<p>As with all active engines, Godot is continuously updated by its makers. Last year, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/open-source-godot-engine-gets-amd-fsr-2-2-support-a-range-of-opengl-shader-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 and several shader improvements. What's next, though? Well, yesterday, creator Juan Linietsky <a href="https://x.com/reduzio/status/1809936892802289813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a lengthy thread on Twitter/X</a> outlining the team's goal for a cinematic renderer: they'd rather go with full path tracing than with a hybrid solution like Unreal Engine 5's Lumen.</p>
<p><em>The first thing to understand is that this type of technology is more in the realm of cinematic renderers. It requires more modern, dedicated GPUs as a baseline. Most Godot users currently do not need or aim for this with their games; hence, it is not a priority. Instead, most of the work the past year was to first modernize the rendering base code and solve all the existing problems. This was needed before any work on a cinematic renderer.</em></p>
<p><em>But okay, let's say everything is ready to do a cinematic renderer. The first thing to understand is that Godot is not Epic. The project does not have 150 veteran graphics engineers who can maintain an insanely huge renderer. [...] </em><em>First of all, it should be ray/path-tracing only (with base raster pass). This saves incredible amounts of work, as shadows, GI, reflections, etc. would all be ray traced. Hybrids like Unreal or Unity HDRP are far too much complexity, and hardware is getting there anyway.</em></p>
<p>It's an interesting take, even though path tracing games can still be counted on one hand. Lumen does have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ser-improves-ue5-lumens-hardware-rt-performance-says-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardware-accelerated ray tracing option</a>, by the way, but again, most developers just skip it in favor of the baseline software solution.</p>
<p>Godot's Juan Linietsky also dived into why he'd rather not follow Epic's approach to virtualized geometry (Nanite):</p>
<p><em>As for Nanite. The problem with it is that it is also just too complex; it works as a hierarchical meshless LOD, plus it's not that friendly with raytracing, which is our main goal. Instead, a much simpler approach can be using more traditional auto-LODs with meshlets, all GPU-driven. This works great with raytracing (just stream LOD levels together). Has a bit more overdraw? Sure, but remember, we don't have shadow maps, so we don't care. Downsides? Probably slower for insanely complex, huge geometry if it spans hundreds of meters. Just divide it up (which most, if not all, games, do anyway), but for anything else, you still get great performance and detail. Also likely will use meshlet LRU less efficiently, but to be honest, unless you are an AAA studio, you don't care about these things; you have something close that solves a similar problem, and on the Godot side, something way simpler to do and maintain.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Linietsky did not provide any timeline as to when the path-traced cinematic rendered might be implemented in Godot, but we'll be certain to keep an eye out on the engine's updates.</p>

			<p>Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku studio is working on a game that will surprise fans, according to online reports.</p>
<p>During the Essence of Fandom event at Anime Expo, the studio <a href="https://x.com/TheYakuzaGuy/status/1809818709252534411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1809818709252534411%7Ctwgr%5Eae66d3d16f50313a8918cfefcca1e0ae1d5a7e4d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Flike-a-dragon-studio-says-fans-will-be-surprised-by-its-next-game%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed their next game</a> and while they couldn't exactly talk about it, they could say that it will surprise fans. Later, it was clarified that they were talking about the next entry in the Like a Dragon series and not about another franchise.</p>
<p>While it will be a while until the next entry in the series releases, fans of the Like a Dragon franchise have <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/">a live-action TV adaptation</a> to look forward to. Directed by Masaharu Take and Kengo Takimoto and starring Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma Kiryu, the show is said to feature the intense fight sequences the series is known for, as well as the most engaging versions of the character and Kamurochō ever made, according to Masayoshi Yokoyama, head of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Like a Dragon series, formerly known as Yakuza in the West, is Infinite Wealth. The game is built upon the mechanics of its predecessor, which introduced turn-based combat to the series, and is a "rollercoaster of emotions and crime drama", as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod-%E2%80%98cybermp%E2%80%99-in-the-works.921171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>'CyberMP' is an upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mod that's currently in pre-alpha stage.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mode-was-canceled-due-to-the-games-rough-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled the multiplayer mode</a> for the Cyberpunk 2077 following the game;s rather rough launch. Initially started as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-a-smaller-project-thats-just-starting-monetization-will-be-wise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'smaller' project</a> for the action-RPG, CDPR decided to can the mode to focus on the game's main single-player experience. "<em>The priority was that the main experience will run for the people in a really good state. And essentially, the switch of priorities meant that other R&amp;D projects had to go away", </em>CDPR's Philipp Webe said in 2022.</p>
<p>Although the game's official multiplayer mode has been canceled, a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cyber_MP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> team of modders</a> has been working on an unofficial mod for the game since last year. Over the course of the year, several short videos of the multiplayer mod in action have been shared, and we now have a gameplay video from YouTube channel 'JuiceHead'. You'll find this nine-minute-long new gameplay video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Actually Playing Cyberpunk 2077 Multiplayer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oKJTufdwzU?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The mod is still in its&nbsp; pre-alpha stage, and no release frames have been provided just yet. The mod will allow Cyberpunk 2077 PC players to play the game with other players, but players won't be able to complete quest cooperatively. Don't expect this unofficial multiplayer mod to be released anytime soon, but we'll update you as soon as we learn more about the mod's progress.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this mod? Will you be playing it? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is available worldwide now for PC and consoles. The game launched rather roughly in late 2020. Although the game did indeed suffer from various issues upon launch, CDPR's VP of PR and Communications has expressed that the game was actually in a better state at launch than it was received. "I actually believe Cyberpunk on launch was way better than it was received, and even the first reviews were positive," CDPR's Platkow-Gilewski said last year. "Then it became a cool thing not to like it. We went from hero to zero really fast. That was the tough moment. We didn't know what was happening. We knew that the game is great, yes we can improve it, yes we need to take time to do it, and we need to rebuild some stuff."</p>

			<p>It looks like 2K Games is developing an unannounced remake of one of its franchises. As often happens in these cases, the rumor started when MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-2k-working-on-unannounced-remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on a LinkedIn resume of a 2K Games 3D artist and Motion Capture Animator the following list of games:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Mafia game</li>
<li>New BioShock game</li>
<li>Supermassive Games project codenamed Erebus (and canceled)</li>
<li>Upcoming Unannounced Remake</li>
</ul>
<p>We already knew that Hangar 13 (which recently released Top Spin 2K25) was making a new entry in the Mafia franchise. Studio General Manager Roman Hladík <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as much in August 2022, when the series was celebrating its twentieth anniversary:</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to confirm we've started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it's a few years away and we can't share anything more right now, we're really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.</em></p>
<p>The same goes for BioShock, of course. The new installment in the dystopian first-person shooter franchise was announced in late 2019, and yet Cloud Chamber is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ramping up recruitment</a> for the project. The third project is also interesting. Supermassive Games partnered with 2K Games to make The Quarry, which launched in June 2022 to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive (9/10) review here on Wccftech</a>. It looks like they were making another game codenamed Erebus; however, it was eventually canceled, which may explain <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-quarry-dark-pictures-dev-supermassive-layoffs-third-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the studio's massive layoffs</a> of a third of its staff a few months ago.</p>
<p>The news of the day is, however, the unannounced remake. Given the publisher's big portfolio, it's really hard to even figure out what it could be. Granted, it's not any one of their sports franchises since remaking an annual sports game wouldn't really make any sense.</p>
<p>That leaves mostly X-COM, Mafia, Civilization, Borderlands, and BioShock. However, Mafia already got <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remake for the first game</a> and a remaster of the second game. BioShock also received remasters as part of the trilogy collection. Perhaps Gearbox's next Borderlands game (which had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be unveiled at Summer Game Fest 2024 but wasn't there after all) is actually a remake of the first one? That one got a remaster, too.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it's something else to look forward to from 2K Games. We'll keep you apprised on any further rumors and leaks on the project.</p>

<p>Zenless Zone Zero was developed by HoYoverse, the studio previously known as miHoYo, and yes, you heard it right, they were the guys responsible for Genshin Impact as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/honkai-star-rail-trails-of-mediocrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honkai Star Rail</a>. Both games have been very successful, and this third one has managed to hit 50 million downloads across the world just four days after the title's debut, which shows that the game is indeed a success in the community and the studio seems to be turning everything it touches into veritable gold.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zenless Zone Zero witnessed 35.7 million users in pre-registration, hence their active downloads are indeed a reflection of how the studio has managed to maintain the hype of their title.

The title was released on July 4 on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401?af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>&nbsp;devices.</p>

<p>The qualifying portion of the Rainbow Six Siege category at the Esports World Cup is now closed and all the challengers have entered the line-up. It’s a stacked deck represented by the best Rainbow Six teams the world has to offer, but some expected competitors failed to make the cut. Now that the board is set, players and fans are preparing for the $2 million event, which will unfold between July 31 and August 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>It has been a successful sprint so far for the Esports World Cup. In the opening days of the event, we saw the Warzone tournament wrap up, followed by T1’s huge win over TES in the League of Legends category. Now, we’re preparing to watch the Rainbow Six Siege portion of the event unfold, which by numbers alone is one of the most valuable categories in the entire showcase, boasting a $2 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Before Rainbow Six comes around, seven more games will take to the stage, covering everything from Apex Legends to PUBG Mobile. It’s a stacked deck out there, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Here’s every team that has made it into the Esports World Cup’s Rainbow Six Siege category:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FaZe Clan </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>w7m Esports </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>Team Liquid </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>FURIA </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>DarkZero </strong>– NA</li>



<li><strong>Luminosity </strong>– NA</li>



<li><strong>Spacestation </strong>– NA</li>



<li><strong>Team BDS </strong>– EU</li>



<li><strong>Wolves Esports </strong>– EU</li>



<li><strong>Into the Breach </strong>– EU</li>



<li><strong>Team Cruelty </strong>– LATAM</li>



<li><strong>Bleed Esports </strong>– APAC</li>



<li><strong>PSG Talon </strong>– APAC</li>



<li><strong>SCARZ </strong>– APAC</li>



<li><strong>Team Bliss </strong>– Oceania</li>



<li><strong>Geekay </strong>– MENA</li>
</ul>



<p>There were high hopes that C9 Beastcoast would qualify for the Esports World Cup, especially since the squad was on a high since winning the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in May. Unfortunately, the squad couldn’t clinch the qualifiers. </p>



<p>Going forward, the expectation is that the trophy will be lifted by the likes of FaZe Clan or perhaps Team BDS – both of these squads have been on fire of late and there’s plenty of potential there for a huge win at the Esports World Cup.</p>

<p>The second trophy has been lifted at the Esports World Cup, and this time, it was in the League of Legends category. In a dominant finish that saw T1 dominate the final stages of the tournament, history was made as Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok notched yet another accolade onto his belt. With the $400,000 grand prize having been issued to T1, alongside the 1,000 Club Championship points, the League of Legends portion of this prestigious event is now at an end.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-record">Another Record</h2>



<p>Faker led his team to victory once again at the Esports World Cup, storming through the playoffs and effortlessly trampling over Bilibili, Team Liquid, and Top Esports. It was a well-deserved victory, but it came with something of a sour taste as it was subsequently revealed that a record-low number of viewers tuned in to watch the iconic South Korean superstar win yet another trophy. This is likely because of the tournament’s setting and financial backing from Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>It was noted that 1.1 million peak viewers were recorded, but that’s nothing compared to some of the biggest League of Legends tournaments that T1 has competed in of late. Admittedly, Riot Games was a late arrival to the Esports World Cup, and it seems almost like the firm wanted to keep its involvement with the event on the down low.</p>



<p>Last year, T1 secured the top prize at the League of Legends World Championship, which marked Faker’s <strong>fourth </strong>Worlds title. There’s no indication that the world-class competitor will slow down, given that he’s one of the most recognisable forces in the esports world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-might-be-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When Bethesda Game Studios pushed out the Fallout 4 next-gen update a couple of months ago, it did so without the consideration of developing mods, such as Fallout: London. This ambitious, game-sized creation has been in development for several years, and it boasts an entirely new world set in the heart of London, England and a voice cast that features some celebrity personalities. </p>



<p>However, when Fallout 4’s major update was released in April 2024, the team at Fallout: London was forced to indefinitely postpone the mod’s release based on the changes the update brought to certain constructs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-will-it">But Will It?</h2>



<p>It was recently revealed that Fallout: London is too big a mod to be hosted on Nexus, which is the leading mod repository for PC gamers worldwide. Instead, the mod will be available to download from GOG, and that’s the final barrier preventing the release of Fallout: London, it was recently confirmed. The team stressed that they’re simply waiting for ‘the green light’ from GOG once the platform has completed QA tests of the super-sized mod.</p>



<p>Fallout: London is expected to be around 35 GB in size and presets the player with several hours of content, even if shade has been cast against it by veteran fans of the franchise because of how lore-breaking it is. Over the years, some of Fallout: London’s development team have been hired by Bethesda Game Studios to work on official Fallout games, and the team has ebbed and flowed.</p>



<p>Following the most recent delay, it was believed by some (me included) that this mod would never see the light of day. It’s great that the work of the Fallout: London team is finally coming to fruition, but it’s ultimately a fantastical fan-made creation that wouldn’t technically fit in the canonical Fallout universe.</p>

<p>Tibia is one of those games you’ve probably never heard of – but really should have. It was released way back in 1997, presenting players with a top-down take on the MMORPG genre, with the developer, Cipsoft, having created a world bursting with opportunities for adventure – but it was a very basic world. Over the years, Tibia was refined, but it never lost the charm that made it so popular with thousands of players.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Cipsoft released the Summer Update for Tibia, introducing a string of changes and quality-of-life improvements that were soaked up positively by the community. Even after more than 26 years, Tibia’s creators are still innovating and keeping things fresh.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lead-the-way">Lead The Way</h2>



<p>Tibia wasn’t the first ever MMORPG to emerge – that credit goes to Neverwinter Nights, which was released in 1991. It <strong>is </strong>a contender for the title of the longest-running (and still active) MMORPG ever, though.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=7952&amp;fbegind=7&amp;fbeginm=6&amp;fbeginy=2024&amp;fendd=7&amp;fendm=7&amp;fendy=2024&amp;flist=11111111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the latest major update</a>, Cipsoft introduced a series of events and tweaks that are designed to make players’ lives a little easier. These improvements included a local ‘quick loot’ mechanic, better pack sorting features, and upgraded UIs. In terms of the more entertaining content, ‘Tibians’ were introduced to The Soulpit, a wave survival arena that can reward players with permanent boosts if they’re able to slay vicious creatures.</p>



<p>Two special events have risen in response to the Summer Update: Sweet Deams and Rise of Podzilla. They’re outlined in the below trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tibia - Summer Update 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1B_svcsK0e8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Elsewhere, Cipsoft has lifted the lid on a new mechanic called The Fragment Workshop, which allows users to ‘maximise the power of (their) gems and optimise (their) character for battle.’</p>



<p>Tibia remains a relatively popular MMORPG with plenty to offer, and updates like this coming a quarter of a century after the game was released are indicative of Cipsoft’s ongoing investment in the game.</p>



<p>The Summer Update is available in Tibia now.</p>

<p>Running 24-hours a day from 30th June to 6th July in Minnesota – and broadcast across the world on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Games Done Quick's Twitch channel</a> – the in-person event was "filled with delightful moments", including everyone's favourite pup <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-the-moment-peanut-butter-becomes-the-first-dog-speedrunner-in-agdq-2024">Peanut Butter</a> playing Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>"The crowd roared at every successful pitch and bat, did the wave, and sang their hearts out with ball game chants," the SGDQ team said. "Other highlights were a coordinated dance of Herald of Darkness during Alan Wake 2 and a musical performance during the 1991 Western classic Sunset Riders."</p>
<p>Crowds gathered physically and virtually for speedy runs of other games like Elden Ring, Minecraft Dungeons, Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain, Halo 3, Old School Runescape, Evil Zone, and "much, much more".</p>

        <p>"Fight for the truth, awaken your resolve, and enter the tournament for the throne."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega has dropped a fresh trailer for Atlus' new RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p>Revealed at a panel at this weekend's Anime Expo 2024, the new teaser gives "viewers an early peek at the turbulent events that kickstart the player’s journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio". You can check it out below:</p>

<p>The video description simply says: "Fight for the truth, awaken your resolve, and enter the tournament for the throne."</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio focuses on a young protagonist drawn into a magical election when the world's king dies. Any person of any social status can become the next king by gaining support of the population, leading to a world-spanning adventure and battle for the throne.</p>
<p>Players will be able to battle in real time with attacks and dodges, which ensures field exploration is dynamic and should make grinding quicker, but turn-based combat remains for traditionalists, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11, 2024</a> on PC via Steam/Windows, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen consoles. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to be a "culmination of our RPGs", said director Katsura Hashino, following the studio's work on the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. Its release marks the 35th anniversary of Atlus' first game. Hashino explained more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-fantasy-election-adapts-personas-social-gameplay">Metaphor's fantasy setting and election twist on familiar Persona gameplay</a>.</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a better time to be an RPG fan? Genre aficionados are eating exceptionally well these days, and Metaphor: ReFantazio is nestling on the horizon with the potential to be the next essential purchase for those in the know. Adding to that hype, ATLUS have released an all-new story trailer at the Anime Expo 2024 panel, offering fans an early peek at the turbulent events that kickstart the player’s journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Story Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5IWiqGKcQg?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today’s Anime Expo panel contained exciting new game details. Metaphor: ReFantazio’s Director Katsura Hashino and Character Designer Shigenori Soejima provided the packed hall with details on the game’s setting, characters, monsters and more. For those in the know, one of the reasons that Metaphor ReFantazio is such a big deal is that these are the creators of Persona 3, 4 and 5, arguably three of the most genre-defining RPGs of the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>You can definitely see that lineage in the visual and character design, with a similarly captivating anime-esque strand carryies through in both the animated cutscenes and in the moment to moment gameplay. There’s an interesting mix of real-time and turn-based aspects to the combat, and it all looks thoroughly enthralling at this point, and that’s before we even know how it all comes together.</p>
<p>Early tomorrow morning, ATLUS will also share details from the panel in a special “ATLUS Exclusive” Showcase – Story livestream on the ATLUS West YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@atlus">https://www.youtube.com/@atlus</a>) and Steam. A recording of the actual AX panel will also be available for viewing at a later date on the ATLUS West YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11, 2024 on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Steam. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now. For more information and for links to pre-order, visit metaphor.atlus.com. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on this one as we get closer to launch!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-is-working-on-an-unannounced-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>2K is working on an unannounced remake.</p>
<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-shupe-45aa09170/">LinkedIn page</a> (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-2k-working-on-unannounced-remake">MP1st</a>) of a motion capture animator who has been working at 2K for the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Among the games you'd expect to see on the resume of a developer working at 2K Games – 2K25 WWE, NBA 2K25, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">upcoming Mafia game</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-game-lands-far-cry-and-ghost-of-tsushima-writer-as-narrative-lead">highly-anticipated new BioShock game</a>, to name but a few – there are also references to two unannounced games (one is a sports title) and an "unannounced upcoming remake".</p>

<p>Whilst it's not unusual for a studio with such a storied catalogue to be remastering or remaking classic games for current-gen systems, news of an "unannounced remake" has some players incredibly excited, not least BioShock fans.</p>
<p>It's been almost ten years since the BioShock trilogy was remastered, and there's plenty of appetite for a reworking of the first BioShock game, widely regarded as one of the best video games ever made.</p>
<p>But that's not all. 2K is also home to the Sid Meier games and Spec-Ops: The Line, another cult classic admired for its storytelling, so there's several games 2K could have pulled from the vault. Watch this space, eh?</p>
<p>ICYMI, BioShock creator Ken Levine is still not done with follow-up project Judas. But the game is inching closer, evidenced recently by its appearance in trailers and now, a marketing beat where select people such as Game Awards host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">have now played it for a number of hours</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface, this is a BioShock game in all but name, with gunplay and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And this is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>.</p>
