            <p>Epic Games has sped up repercussions for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who used V-Bucks and refunded them through an exploit on Xbox, essentially getting the in-game currency for free.</p>
<p>As we moved into the weekend, the studio <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964118061763432684">said</a> it had now "fixed a delay" and would be claiming back any items that were bought through currency that had been refunded on Xbox or previously gifted from fraudulent accounts.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the system it uses to revoke items on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025 "malfunctioned", the company <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964011363363107319">warned</a> some players "may now see a message that their payment was reversed or refunded and see recent items have been removed, even from transactions from several months ago".</p>

<p>It comes after some Xbox players abused an exploit through which they could buy V-Bucks through Microsoft, apply them to their accounts, and then refund them.</p>
<p>After clarifying this "does not affect regular purchases on Xbox or any other platform that weren't refunded", the Fortnite Status X/Twitter account added:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update on Xbox refund issue:</p><p>Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account.

</p></div>
<p>"Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account," Epic explained. "When V-Bucks are purchased, spent, and refunded, causing the player’s V-Bucks balance to go negative, items most recently purchased and gifted with the refunded V-Bucks are removed from the player’s account and the gift recipient's account.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the system we built for this malfunctioned on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025. During this time, players were receiving refunds, but the refunded V-Bucks and items purchased with refunded V-Bucks remained in the player’s account and gift recipient accounts."</p>
<p>While Epic accepts that over this period most players "continued using purchasing and refunding in good faith as usual", some "exploited the situation to make large numbers of purchases, often with many accounts. Some even set up shops to accept payments from players and gifted them items purchased with refunded V-Bucks".</p>
<p>It's taken so long to sort the issue, however, that when Epic began processing back-dated refund requests on Xbox on 4th September and confusing players, it's now "making a correction to distinguish between accounts that made ordinary refund requests, and accounts exploiting the refund system".</p>
<p>"We're restoring the items that were removed earlier this week for players who made less than 7 refunds since Dec 2024. It was our fault that we didn't update the V-Bucks balance in their account immediately as we should have. This will take a few days," Epic conceded.</p><p>"The removed items will stay removed for anyone who received 7 or more refunds, and for items received through gifting from players who made 7 or more refunds during this time. This is the ordinary approach to refunds from our terms of service, and these item purchases were taking advantage of an exploit with the V-Bucks refund system."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-return-to-ios-in-the-uk-uncertain-as-epic-accuses-uk-regulator-of-deprioritising-store-competition">Epic Games recently claimed the return of Fortnite to iOS in the UK is "uncertain"</a> as it's been unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever", after the CMA – the UK's competition regulator –  has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been one year since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> pulled the plug on <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, a multiplayer shooter that was meant to lead the publisher’s vanguard of AAA live service titles. Instead, it became a grim harbinger, attracting so few players at launch that the game was brutally axed with all traces of its existence quickly removed – a cleanup operation that resulted in the shuttering of developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> and the displacement of many talented workers.</p>
<p>The development budget of Concord has never been confirmed by Sony, with estimates of between 200 and 400 million dollars. Whatever the true figure was, the game’s commercial failure sent shockwaves through the PlayStation business, leading Sony to scrap multiple live service projects on top of the ones it had already cancelled. It’s reported that nearly every major first party studio had been working on a live service series that included flagpole franchises such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war">God of War</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still, when it was announced that Concord would go offline forever, just two weeks after launch, it came as a surprise to me. I thoroughly enjoyed my short time while reviewing it and was optimistic about the game’s future despite some evident shortcomings. When it comes to live service titles, most endure a somewhat rocky launch period as developers take on board feedback to make improvements while rolling out a roadmap of new content.</p>
<p>So, why did Concord fail so badly? And why was Sony particularly keen to wipe it from existence? There’s a combination of factors, really, starting with the game’s lack of distinction amidst an already saturated market of hero shooters. Overwatch 2 was still relatively popular, alongside Valorant and Apex Legends as well as new and upcoming games like Ubisoft’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>. The only thing that really set Concord apart was its focus on narrative, promising weekly cinematics that would add depth to the game’s cast of characters and the universe they existed in. It was an interesting concept but one that we never got to see play out.</p>


<p>Speaking of characters, the design of Concord’s playable heroes was a weak point that naysayers immediately latched onto. Considering the game was about a spacefaring team of misfits, akin to Guardians of the Galaxy, many of the designs were disappointingly drab and lacked imagination. Despite a handful of exceptions, many were bland human characters dressed in clumsy outfits. Some of Concord’s unlockable cosmetics promised more exotic hero designs though, again, we never got to see these in full effect.</p>
<p>Pricing was another issue for Sony. This is one area where Concord actually stood out, eschewing the popular free-to-play model that even Overwatch 2 had recently shifted to, in favour of a £34.99 price tag with the promise that all future content (including heroes, maps, and modes) would not be tied to microtransactions. As someone fed up with exploitative microtransactions in free-to-play games, this is something I personally welcomed, knowing that I could make a single upfront payment instead of being regularly stung with each new season or battle pass. Of course, many other gamers didn’t share this view, unwilling to part with £34.99 to see if they liked the game or not.</p>
<p>If Concord had launched a year of two earlier, it may have been an entirely different story. Or, at least, Sony may have given the game more of a chance before marching it off to the gallows. By the time Concord was revealed to the public, after many long months of teasing, there simply wasn’t an appetite for this kind of online shooter. With a development cycle of approximately eight years, Firewalk’s debut game was late to the party, launching at a time when live service fatigue was at an all-time high. The writing was on the wall when Concord’s reveal event failed to excite even the most ardent PlayStation fans, followed by a poor turnout during pre-launch playtests.</p>

<p>With so much time and money having already been poured into the game, Sony made the ill-fated decision to march on without delay. In the days leading up to its launch, there was a definite sense that Concord had been sent out to die with a minimal marketing presence and launch right in the middle of Gamescom. active players and copies sold were always going to be far lower than the publisher’s original forecast, but it felt like Concord would have a long tail and the chance of a comeback story. One that Sony could learn from to strengthen its remaining live service games in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Sadly, we’ll never get to see what Concord could have evolved into if Sony hadn’t been embarrassed into such a kneejerk reaction. Despite some unappealing qualities, the core gameplay was extremely fun and well-polished – Firewalk had actually nailed the part that matters most for an online shooter, but it sadly wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Although it held out far longer than Concord ever did, we saw a similar story with XDefiant, Ubisoft’s attempted “COD killer” that sewed together elements from a number of the publisher’s hit franchises. It ended up being another strong shooter that simply couldn’t attract enough players to keep the lights on. We also saw this happen with Splitgate… and Splitgate 2. In fact, the only recent success story in this genre has been Marvel Rivals which, despite being hugely derivative, has leveraged the still popular IP to draw in players.</p>
<p>Sony has paid the price for leaning so heavily on live service games as part of its current-gen strategy, which could be to blame for a smaller selection of first party hits compared to this point in the last generation. Now, all eyes turn towards its next big online title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, which has had problems of its own. There’s a growing fatigue surrounding the already niche extraction shooter, and despite Marathon’s slick reveal trailer and key art (some of which was plagiarised), the hype train has slowed to a crawl following initial playtests with Bungie now going back to the drawing board. Let’s hope the former Halo devs can right the ship instead of hammering another nail in PlayStation’s live service ambitions.</p>

<p>Last time, we checked out the original Harvest Moon for the SNES, and would you believe it, it was actually the more realistic European design that won the day with 46% of the vote. North America was the runner-up with 34%, while Japan only managed 20%.</p>
<p>This week, to celebrate the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken</a> on Nintendo Switch Online, we're going to look at... Forsaken! Madness. Yes, originally launched in 1998 from publisher Acclaim Entertainment, Forsake was relatively well-received for its first-person gameplay and was given the remaster treatment by Nightdive on other platforms back in 2018.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Forsaken didn't launch in Japan, so we're back to a two-way duel this week with North America going head-to-head with Europe. Let battle commence.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:187360 @ 1757260305 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Forsaken - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f44a44c3bc23/forsaken-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/240-forsaken-64/1821-harvest-moon13-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Acclaim Entertainment / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American version of Forsaken features model Donna DeCianni sporting a rather unsavoury 'Forsaken' tattoo on her left cheek, which is probably why she's shedding a tear, to be honest. The background looks a bit barren; almost like it's been ripped from the world of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, or something. It's a recognisable piece though, even if the game's logo isn't necessarily that impactful.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ce3d612ecb4c/harvest-moon-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/240-forsaken-641-harvest-moonils/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Acclaim Entertainment / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European version features a much cooler font for the game title itself, though it's fair to say that the overall composition is maybe a little barebones. You've got what looks like a bronze-coloured globe with the letter 'F' imprinted on the front, with flames rising from the bottom of the box to surround the game title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War TV show, which will air on Amazon Prime Video, could begin filming its debut season in March 2026, according to a rumor <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-god-of-war-series-set-to-begin-filming-in-march-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Nexus Point News</a>. The website's sources also allege that the show will be filmed in Vancouver, a renowned filming hub thanks to its significant cost savings due to the lower Canadian dollar and generous government tax credits. The Canadian city also boasts a highly skilled and experienced local crew, state-of-the-art facilities, and incredibly diverse scenery.</p>



<p>The God of War TV show was <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on December 15, 2022, but had to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooted</a> about a year ago after changing the showrunner and producers. Ronald D. Moore, known for Star Trek: Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, and For All Mankind, is the new showrunner, writer, and executive producer. There are other writers, though:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matthew Graham (Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, Electric Dreams, and Spanish Princess)</li>



<li>Stephanie Shannon (For All Mankind and Outlander)</li>



<li>Naren Shankar (The Expanse and For All Mankind)</li>



<li>Joe Menosky (Star Trek: Next Generation, Voyager, Discovery, The Orville, and For All Mankind)</li>



<li>Marc D. Bernardin (Castle Rock, Treadstone, Carnival Row, and Star Trek: Picard)</li>



<li>Tania Lotia (The Witcher and Carnival Row)</li>
</ul>



<p>If the beginning of filming is indeed this close, the main cast is probably already chosen, and an announcement may be made before the end of the year. Furthermore, fans can probably anticipate the series to air on Prime Video at some point in 2027.</p>



<p>Overall, Amazon is betting heavily on gaming IPs with Prime Video adaptations. Fallout's debut season registered incredible success and they're looking to repeat it with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming second season</a> and an already announced third season, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</a> wasn't quite as acclaimed. There's a lot more on the way, though, including the Tomb Raider TV show adaptation, which we just learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature Sophia Turner (Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones) as Lara Croft</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect TV series</a> that will be produced by the same team behind Fallout, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfenstein TV show</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange adaptation</a> confirmed just two days ago, and the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000 cinematic universe featuring Henry Cavill</a> (although the status of this one is unclear). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> launches for the Switch and Switch 2 next month, and to build some excitement, Square Enix has now released an extensive gameplay overview trailer.</p>
<p>Over seven minutes, you can get a better look at the game's exploration, combat, party lineup and more in the "stunning new versions" of these classics. It follows on from the development team announcing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-has-officially-gone-gold-out-this-october">the game had gone gold last week</a>.</p>

<p>"What fun memories do they bring back?"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft began its 30th anniversary celebrations for its famous video game mascot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the news he'll be returning at some point in the future (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-kicks-off-raymans-30th-anniversary-says-new-project-is-in-good-hands">with work on a new project now underway</a>), Ubisoft is planning to reflect on the character's career with behind-the-scenes information, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art and "more".</p>
<p>To kick things off, it has shared some concept art for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/rayman_legends">Rayman Legends</a>, which released for the Wii U in 2013 and followed with a Definitive Edition release on the Switch in 2017.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Return to the Glade of Dreams with these beautiful official Rayman Legends concept artworks. What fun memories do they bring back?"</p>

<p>Ubisoft also mentions how it will be "traveling back in time" to the original Rayman game "in the months ahead".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're kicking off our celebration with Rayman Legends and will be traveling back in time to the Rayman 1 in the months ahead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some related news, the Ubisoft free-to-play multiplayer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brawlhalla">Brawlhalla</a> this week launched a limited-time Rayman 30th anniversary celebration - adding a new look for Rayman, themed stages and more. Along with this, one of the rumoured games on the way to the Switch Online N64 app in the future is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>.</p>

<p>Addressing crashes, save stability and much more</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a> admittedly didn't get off to the best start when it launched on the Switch in July. Fortunately, the team at Weta Workshop has been busy improving the overall experience since then.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the latest game update has now been rolled out across all platforms. Below are the official patch notes for the Switch version. It improves save file stability, lifts the volume in handheld mode, resolves stuttering and crashing problems, and more.</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>
<p><strong>Save files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We've made some changes to improve saving stability, so that your save files are tucked away safe and sound."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spinach Seeds</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It seemed that the spinach seeds weren't too fond of being planted on Switch. We've coaxed them back, so they're ready to sprout when the time is right."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The volume in handheld mode has been gently lifted, making it easier to hear all sorts of things - babbling brooks and beyond."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stuttering and crashing</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hobbits became blocked from playing after the game began to stammer, then crashed like a cart with a broken wheel. Not the sort of thing we take lightly in Bywater."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have also been some fixes on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and along with this are some cross-console fixes, which address issues across all platforms.</p>
<h3><strong>Cross-console</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waking Up Under Your Home<br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Hobbit home is all about comfort, and it's certainly not comforting finding yourself underneath those nicely tiled floors of yours. You can rest easy knowing you'll wake up safe and sound inside your home."<strong><br></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Controller Vibrations</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Controller vibrations have been softened across all consoles, much more suitable for a Hobbit's pace and no more fear of those teacups shaking off the table."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stuck Guests</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After enjoying a delicious meal together, some townsfolk found themselves trapped in unlocked areas of one's home. Keeping guests stuck in odd corners isn't what any well-mannered Hobbit would call good hosting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mismatched Floors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For those who appreciate tidy lines, it's been a bother getting one's home to feel just right when the floor patterns face different directions in the halls between rooms."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">initially announced its God of War adaptation</a> back in December 2022. Series showrunner, Ronald D. Moore, recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-show-retain-the-tone-of-the-2018-reboot-series-but-also-makes-reference-to-older-greek-saga">the adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game</a>, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained at the time. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">Moore joined the production almost two years after its was confirmed to be in the works</a> after the series based on Sony Santa Monica's God of War series reportedly had a "do-over" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">the companies involved decided on a "different creative direction"</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like Bethesda has begun teasing new content for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, after fans spotted a hidden message in a social media video released to celebrate the game’s two-year anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, starts off innocently enough, but soon the tone of the music shifts and the image becomes garbled. Clearly, there’s a tease in there somewhere!</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Celebrating two incredible years in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Starfield</a>. 🌌</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has explored the Settled Systems with us.

It didn’t take long for Starfield fans to arrange the frames in such a way to form the words ‘Terran Armada,’ which has sent the game’s community down a rabbit hole of speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Starfield follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious suggestion is Terran Armada is the name of Starfield’s long-awaited second expansion. If so, it suggests a DLC that revolves around Earth, people who left Earth, or people who still are on Earth. Some are speculating that Terran Armada, if this does in fact relate to DLC, will be about the return ships that left Earth at some point in the past, perhaps a fleet of generation ships. Another popular theory is that the Terrans are the name of a new enemy faction of survivors left on Earth after its destruction, which could evoke Mad Max vibes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Starfield, Earth became a barren, uninhabitable wasteland after its magnetosphere collapsed in 2203, leading to the dissipation of its atmosphere and the evacuation of humanity. The collapse was a direct consequence of the invention and widespread use of the Grav Drive, a technology enabling faster-than-light travel. The planet is now exposed to dangerous solar and cosmic radiation and is covered in toxic vents and impact craters, with no signs of life.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps Terran Armada isn’t DLC 2 after all, and instead is a stop-gap update designed to tide fans over until the promised second expansion finally materializes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever this is, clearly Starfield fans who have stuck with the game since its launch in 2023 are chomping at the bit. Apart from vague words of reassurance, Bethesda has remained tight-lipped on the future of Starfield, only recently teasing improvements to space travel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've waited 11 months for a three-second screen that changed colors and revealed a few letters of a broken up word (and we're probably gonna have to wait another 4-6 months for anything more),” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1na14cn/comment/ncqt0fm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Elkupalos</a>. “We're beyond starved at this point haha. Next trailer or update of actual substance is gonna hit us fans like a nuke.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/following-datamine-leak-bethesda-confirms-starfield-space-gameplay-revamp-to-make-the-travels-there-more-rewarding">Bethesda confirmed improvements to Starfield space gameplay “to make the travels there more rewarding”</a> after datamined fragments of code suggested the developer had a more streamlined space travel experience in the works. Based on this datamine, while you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, you won’t be able to fly all the way between systems, nor fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new video discussing his career, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio had been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story was still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of expansions arriving annually</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

He also remained as a key figure at the gaming publisher throughout Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-acquisition-officially-complete-bethesda-now-a-part-of-xbox"><u>completed in 2021</u></a>, before going on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-pete-hines-announces-retirement"><u>announce his retirement in 2023</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines brought his time at Bethesda to an end after 24 years. However, it seems it was the quieter moments working with ZeniMax founder and CEO Robert Altman, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-a-altman-zenimax-founder-and-ceo-dies"><u>passed away in 2021</u></a>, that he remembers most fondly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was Robert Altman's company, and we were his employees, no question,” Hines said. “But he treated us more like family, and we found a culture that really fit us. When it was working, it was magical. We were a small, private company. It's way easier to stay out of scrutiny when you're not having to put your earnings reports out for the whole world.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda, which now serves under the titan that is Microsoft, encompasses a variety of different game studios. This includes its development arm, Bethesda Game Studios, Doom developer id Software, Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, Wolfenstein studio MachineGames, and The Elder Scrolls Online studio ZeniMax Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have turned to the company for everything from giant, trend-setting RPGs to laser-focused first-person shooters, but in 2024, the Bethesda umbrella shrunk. Just three years after Microsoft completed its acquisition, the Xbox company announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shock-and-anger-as-xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more"><u>shutting down Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</u></a> (Tango was later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-says-it-didnt-buy-tango-gameworks-from-microsoft-for-profit-we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money"><u>acquired by Krafton</u></a>).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's just no question that the company is not the same.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has gone through major shifts both before and after the Microsoft acquisition. For better or worse, Hines says there’s no denying the company he started at in 1999 has changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's just no question that the company is not the same,” he added. “It has been radically changed and altered from the company that we built. It is what it is. Things change. Things move on, but at its height, it was really a special thing to be a part of.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the interview with Hines, the former Bethesda executive touched on how he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-hines-comments-on-the-confusion-surrounding-how-bethesda-named-prey-2017-dont-even-get-me-started?_cache=pass"><u>fought to change the name of Arkane’s Prey</u></a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers"><u>his thoughts on gaming subscription services like Game Pass</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox is now offering PlayStation Store pre-order refunds as it makes “big changes” after a backlash to its decision to lock clans behind DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The furore began with the confirmation that Bloodlines 2 would feature four clans: Brujah; Tremere; Banu Haqim; and Ventrue. While this selection provides four different starting options for how you build your protagonist, it’s a more limited offering compared to the cult classic original Bloodlines, which featured seven clans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Chinese Room added a further two clans to Bloodlines 2 (Lasombra and Toreador), but these were only available as part of the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which costs $21.99 as DLC, or included as part of the $89.99 Premium Edition. The standard edition costs $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This DLC is available from day one, which has created the impression that the “full” roster has been carved up, with only those paying extra getting the complete launch experience. As you’d expect, fans were quick to express their dissatisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At gamescom 2025, a representative for publisher Paradox told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-two-clans-locked-behind-dlc-because-of-business"><u>the decision was a “business” informed choice</u></a>, prompting further outcry. Then, last month, a post on Discord from Paradox suggested a significant change would be coming ahead of launch, and now the publisher has gone one step further by issuing PlayStation Store pre-order refunds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi,” <a href="https://x.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1964016313958838399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on social media on the official Bloodlines 2 account began</a>. “We’re making adjustments and will share the details on Sept 17. Big changes take time, and we want to do this right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PS Store pre-orders will be refunded on Sept 8. You’ll be able to pre-order again before launch on Oct 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thanks for your patience; we’ll share more soon!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now wondering whether Paradox will include Lasombra and Toreador by default and not as DLC at base game price. Certainly, the sentiment online is that’s the expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly nothing short of fully including them at base game price will turn me around on this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bringdownthesky.bsky.social/post/3ly47xynyyk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one social media user</a> in response to the announcement. “Otherwise I'm skipping.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The only way to salvage this and regain trust with the community is to sell the base game as-is with all clans available and rather sell DLC with new side stories and cosmetics on the side or just add the cosmetics/side stories as part of a higher tier eg deluxe edition/premium edition, as that won't mess with the main story/narrative etc,” <a href="https://x.com/SplashbangOW/status/1964040019204809157" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed thanks for the reaction to the backlash. “I'm very excited and hopeful to see what you came up with for the two clans locked behind DLC issue,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kixieboo.bsky.social/post/3ly4xxtqfbc2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one fan</a>. “I'd like to thank you for listening to community feedback and working to fix the issue. I'm sure refunding store pre-orders was not an easy decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has suffered a difficult development and a number of high-profile delays, but it is a crucial release for Paradox. The publisher will be keen to give it the best chance possible to succeed, and backtracking on its DLC plans may be the only viable option at this stage.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-4-continues-the-original-games-story-after-15-years/1100-6533653/" data-ref-id="1100-6533653">officially announced in 2025 during a showcase for developer THQ Nordic</a>, and many longtime fans of the franchise are curious about its release date, story, and gameplay. The last time we saw the Darksiders franchise was in 2019 with the release of Darksiders Genesis, a prequel to the original trilogy. This game was met with positive reviews from critics and fans alike, but after radio silence from THQ Nordic for several years, many players thought it could be the last time we'd see the Four Horsemen in action.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, with Darksiders 4 confirmed, we finally get to see what THQ Nordic has been cooking up all of this time. We know the Four Horsemen are returning and picking up where they left off at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, but what else do we know about the fourth installment in the franchise? You can check out everything we know about Darksiders 4 in the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Darksiders 4 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">While we did get the reveal of Darksiders 4, THQ Nordic still has not given us a release date for the new action-RPG. Right now, the current release date is "to be announced," and there's no indication as to when an announcement is expected.</p><p dir="ltr">So, as of right now, we're pretty much in the dark when it comes to a release date for Darksiders 4. It's unclear how far along in development THQ Nordic is with the game, either, so we don't have anything to go on at the time of writing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Darksiders 4</h2><p dir="ltr">As we don't have a concrete release date for Darksiders 4, there's currently no way to preorder the game on any of its available platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S). This also means we don't know how much Darksiders 4 will cost. However, Darksiders has, in recent years, usually been priced under the industry standard for a new AAA game. For example, Darksiders III retailed for $40 at launch, and Darksiders Genesis came in at $30. THQ Nordic could take that same approach with Darksiders 4, which would put it at around $50-60, but it might also be a full-priced, $70 game.</p><p dir="ltr">All you can do right now is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203170?utm_source=thqnordic-next-darksiders4" rel="nofollow ">wishlist the game's Standard Edition on PC via Steam</a>. This gives you a notification when Darksiders 4 officially goes live for preorders.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Darksiders 4 teaser</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want a small glimpse into what THQ Nordic has in store with Darksiders 4, you can watch the official teaser trailer for the action-RPG below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eafBknCPcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, this is only a sneak peek at the game that confirms the return of the Four Horsemen. We'll have to wait for a proper trailer to see exactly what Darksiders 4 will look like.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Darksiders is coming to PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's currently unknown if THQ Nordic will attempt to port the game to other platforms, such as Nintendo Switch 2, in the future. For now, though, Darksiders 4 will launch for only the current-gen platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Story, Setting, And Characters</h2><p dir="ltr">As we only have a small teaser trailer to go off, we don't know too much about the story of Darksiders 4. We do know that the game picks up at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, though, so the setting will still be the post-apocalyptic version of Earth that's remained prevalent throughout the franchise's life. The developers also said that the setting will take place over different realms within the post-apocalyptic landscape, and each realm has unique bosses, items, and visuals.</p><p dir="ltr">During the game, you'll get to play as one of the Four Horsemen characters, who have become staples of the franchise. Death, Strife, Fury, and War are back in Darksiders 4, and you can choose which one to play as for a playthrough. Each of the Horsemen features different weapons, abilities, and playstyles, giving you more replayability options for second, third, and fourth playthroughs of the main story.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the Four Horsemen, we're unsure of any additional characters in Darksiders 4. However, with the story starting from the end of the first game, it's a safe bet that some characters from the original will make an appearance.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Gameplay And Multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">While we await more details and showcases of Darksiders 4, the developers have given us an idea of how the game will play. Just like the other games in the series, the fourth installment is a third-person action-RPG that emphasizes combat, narrative storytelling, and exploration through a lore-rich world.</p><p dir="ltr">The combat in Darksiders 4 features up-close melee action and supernatural abilities that each of the characters possesses. These abilities can all likely be used in combat in some fashion, but other abilities could be more useful outside of engagements with enemies. In the case of Strife, we'll also likely be able to use his guns. Building on the cooperative feature in Genesis, it's also been confirmed that Darksiders 4 will support up to four people in cooperative play, with each controller one of the Four Horsemen.</p><p dir="ltr">THQ Nordic specifies "traversal and puzzle-solving" as key components to the game. Darksiders is no stranger to unique movement and puzzles across the post-apocalypse, but the early marketing seems to suggest those elements will play a larger role in Darksiders 4. Some characters might offer more traversal abilities than others, which could give them an edge while exploring the map, while other characters might have abilities that make them tankier in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">We still don't know a large chunk of how Darksiders 4 will look when it comes to gameplay, but THQ Nordic should be able to build off the foundation from the previous games in the franchise.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<p><em>A follow-up to 2023's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bokura">BOKURA</a>, indie developer tokoronyori <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bokura-planet-switch-2/">says of the first game</a> that he "kept wondering what scenery I might have seen if I'd gone in the complete opposite direction...In the end, I couldn't hold back. I ran the other way, which is how BOKURA: planet was born, and the view here is incredible."</em></p>
<p><em>Intriguing. Let's see how NL's two-man expedition went...<br></em></p>
<h2>Crew member #1's log (Blue)</h2>
<p>I've played my Switch 2 near enough every day for the past three months, and the one fancy new feature I have used less than any other is GameChat. I have fiddled about with it hesitantly in the odd game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, but I was yet to have as much fun with it as those squeaky clean 20-somethings in all the console's marketing were promising.</p>
<figure><a title="BOKURA: planet Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158484/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was then that I stumbled onto Bokura: Planet, an online co-op-only Switch 2 game that I had heard next to no one talking about, but one that felt tailor-made for some GameChat good times. Keen to see one of the Switch 2's flagship features in action, I recruited a willing participant (say hello to Gavin, everyone!) and stepped boldly into a space puzzle adventure where (seemingly) few had gone before.</p>
<p>The result? A little over three hours of belly laughs and head scratchers, with a refreshingly creative story structure. It might not be the most visually or technically taxing use of Switch 2, but you'd be hard pushed to find a better use for GameChat.</p>
<p>But before I blast off into all that, let's cover some context. This and its predecessor, 2023's BOKURA, have a lot in common. Both are two-player-only affairs played online across two systems with a heavy focus on communication, which is vital to progression. Both use that central gimmick to give each player their own view of the same puzzle, often splitting you into different areas, which necessitates poor descriptions, bad sound mimicry, and a lot of trial and error. Both adopt the same simplistic pixel art visuals that frequently walk the line between cute and creepy.</p>
<figure><a title="BOKURA: planet Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158483/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The big change for the sequel (aside from the addition of GameChat if you're playing on Switch 2, although the game is also on S1) is that the central 'split' gameplay mechanic extends to the story structure. A pair of space explorers crash-land on an alien planet and set about hunting down their lost recon drone and getting their bearings. The two nameless heroes are quickly split up, and each undergoes their own private story beats, which are kept secret — or <em>should</em> be — from the other throughout the rest of the game.</p>
<p>It's an idea that I struggled to get my head around at first. A small crossed-out mic symbol appears on the screen before you enter your private story content, and it's only after getting your first dose of text exposition that the game, or more specifically your character, explicitly says to keep it a secret from your partner. Unfortunately, Gavin and I are both certified blabbermouths, and for whatever reason, the mic symbol didn't immediately line up with "Don't tell your partner this bit" in either of our heads, as we both gasped and exclaimed in surprise before the game eventually put us in our place.</p>
<figure><a title="BOKURA: planet Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158482/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even with the initial surprise half-spoiled — seriously, why not replace the mic symbol with something more concrete, like, I don't know, a big red message reading "KEEP THIS BIT A SECRET, YOU FOOL!"? — the split story means Bokura: Planet stands out in the sea of co-op puzzlers. I chucked inwardly as I heard Gavin ponder the relationship between our characters (something I had extra knowledge of thanks to my private, and often unexpectedly dark storyline), and sat open-mouthed when certain revelations reminded me how little of the 'full picture' I'd seen myself.</p>
<p>It's not all story and surprises, mind you. You'll spend most of your time with Bokura: Planet working your way through a series of single-screen puzzles, where you're tasked with describing your view to your partner, flicking switches, aligning symbols, and opening gates. The 'split' perspective is, once again, a neat idea (if not a particularly novel one), but Planet does a good job of mixing up the objectives so things don't become too stale. We were smirking as we described suggestively-shaped symbols on one screen, then screaming as we dodged grotesque creatures, deadly drops, and lasers on the next.</p>

<p>The difficulty seemed to sit in a sweet spot, too, even when the screen-sharing capabilities of GameChat meant that we could peek at each other's view and solve the problems quicker if we got really stuck. - <em>Jim Norman</em></p>
<h2>Crew member #2's log (Red)</h2>
<p>I quickly realised my error after blurting out my shocking onscreen events to which Jim wasn't privy. In hindsight, of course the crossed-out mic symbol <em>obviously</em> means 'STFU', but with all the (well-localised) dialogue boxes I'd seen up to then, it felt odd to use a symbol to communicate such important instructions. I suppose the text represented in-game dialogue and thoughts, while the symbol was meant only for you, the player.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was only one of two communication hiccups — the other being when firing up the game for the first time and being presented with a Japanese EULA (don't panic, just move to the option on the left and hit 'A' to cycle through the available languages - English is the second option) — but, honestly, it didn't affect our enjoyment.</p>

<p>The ensuing blend of cutesy pixel art and slightly gungy body horror came as a surprise — a welcome one, although, along with all the phallic symbols, it did have us pondering that PEGI 7 rating — in a game that otherwise presents block-pulling, button-pushing, laser-disabling, now-I'm-controlling-a-robot-on-<em>your</em>-screen puzzles and light platforming challenges. It's clever co-op stuff, mixing audio and visual conundrums engagingly, but the underlying narrative adds a touch of spice. It's a poignant story that ties in the few verbs at your disposal in neat ways.</p>
<p>When it comes to negatives, the jump takes a little getting used to, and you'll likely fall off some ledges during the three or four hours you'll be playing - although auto-save means you shouldn't have to redo much. Using GameChat means the audio is quieter, although that doesn't affect the ambient soundtrack here too much — you'll just have to listen carefully in sound-specific puzzles.</p>
<p>The game's opening menu screen isn't the most user-friendly, either. Sharing your code with your partner is straightforward enough (and the game automatically picks up where you left off when you pair up again in your next play session), but navigating the three menu icons feels more awkward than it should. Bokura: Planet also supports Mouse Mode, which is nice, although we struggled to find any reason for it beyond navigating menus.</p>

<p>For the low asking price, though, there's nothing to get upset about, and Nintendo couldn't ask for a better GameChat showcase. Indeed, having now played it, it's easy to see why the platform holder waved this onto the Switch 2 eShop when so many other indie teams are struggling to even get dev kits. - <em>Gavin Lane</em></p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bokura: Planet was a lovely surprise, with an intriguing, diverging co-op narrative that creates tension beneath its novel puzzles without completely jettisoning its cutesy vibes for pixel horror. If you're looking for a reflective, grown-up adventure with laughs, gasps, and perhaps even a tear or two, this affecting little expedition will claim but a few hours of your life and is worth enlisting a friend for.</p></section>
