<p>Fortnite is arguably the best game for collaborations, bringing characters, worlds, and much more from many franchises to this battle royale title. The next Fortnite collaboration is with Pirates of the Caribbean, bringing skins, emotes, and more from Disney’s sea-faring franchise. Reliable leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1804393861994647818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1804381938213372193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> have posted nonstop about this collaboration since Saturday, June 22, and we finally have a release date. Learn more details below.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-me-hearties">Me Hearties</h2>



<p>On June 22, we were treated to a surprise from reliable Fortnite leakers HYPEX and ShiinaBR. They detailed the features of the Fortnite x Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration, leaking details such as the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1804383340985790912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1804383340985790912%7Ctwgr%5Ee72c79a55e47e49eb864580f59a1430cdc9482e0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffortnites-pirates-of-the-caribbean-crossover-launches-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">loading screen</a>, a mini pass, the Jack Sparrow skin and much more. </p>



<p>To everyone’s surprise, Epic made the Pirates of the Caribbean mini-pass go live on the Fortnite Item Shop soon after these tweets without any prior announcements. Unsurprisingly, the mini-pass listing was promptly removed from the store. However, many players had already purchased it in the meantime, adding to the excitement and anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Pirates of the Caribbean mini-pass, titled Cursed Sailed Pass, was unexpectedly offered to the players before its intended release date. The players who managed to buy the pass in that time unlocked the Jack Sparrow skin. </p>



<p>However, they couldn’t progress further in the past. The official Fortnite Status account had to clarify the situation, stating that the players who bought the pass before the intended release date can only use the Jack Sparrow skin until it officially arrives. Interestingly, the Fortnite Status account also confirmed that the planned release date for the Cursed Sails Pass is July 19, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For players who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its intended release on July 19, please note you are currently unable to progress the Pass until the start of the event, but will retain your Jack Sparrow outfit in the meantime.</p><p>If you wish to instead refund this purchase… <a href="https://t.co/i3FdtuNSLW">pic.twitter.com/i3FdtuNSLW</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1804535483571007684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the leaks, the Cursed Sails Pass is set to include a treasure trove of in-game items. These include Jack’s Sword pickaxe, Jack’s Compass back bling, a Cursed variation of the Jack Sparrow Skin, Jar of Dirt emote, Sparrow Run emote, Pirate’s Grin emoticon, a banner icon, and 4 level tokens. Each item is designed to bring a touch of Pirates of the Caribbean magic to your Fortnite experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you aren’t happy about the waiting time for the Pass to go live and wish to refund your purchase and return the Jack Sparrow skin, you can contact the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">player support team</a>. In other Fortnite news, their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-new-reload-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Reload game mode</a> just went live recently, and their esports tournaments will no longer be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-esports-tournaments-will-not-be-region-locked-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">region-locked</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Inspired by Chinese lion dances, it turns out that this boss is actually two dudes in a coat masquerading as a monster and not some horrible abomination dreamt up by its creators. It's just like all those kids in Saturday-morning cartoons pretending to be adults when they hid themselves under a trenchcoat and combined their height to sneak past concert security.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO8vEHspEdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dO8vEHspEdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As discovered by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bonfirevn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BonfireVN</a> (via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-dlcs-fearsome-dancing-lion-boss-is-just-two-big-dudes-in-a-suit-124451502.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Endgadget</a>), Divine Beast Dancing Lion is comprised of one person in the front who attacks while pantomiming as a monster, while another crouched enemy in the rear controls the body. This is pretty accurate to how real-life Chinese lion dancers perform, and From Software went so far as to animate both of the deadly dancers beneath the costume. It turns out that not everything has to be a grotesque monster after all.

        <p>"This reporting is categorically not true," a spokesperson told us</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>GAME has denied reports that it will stop selling physical games.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/news/game-ending-in-store-video-game-sales/">Gfinity</a> reported that the UK retailer was planning to only sell physical games and hardware via pre-orders online, to be collected in-store or delivered to consumers.</p>
<p>"This reporting is categorically not true," a spokesperson told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. "GAME continues to support the physical gaming market, offering a wide-range of physical games, hardware, software, accessories, and digital gift cards, in store and online."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the UK games retailer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-drops-xbox-all-access-and-reward-scheme">dropped its reward scheme and Xbox All Access</a>. In January, GAME began <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-chain-game-to-exit-pre-owned-business">phasing out trade-ins and the sale of pre-owned games</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-we-will-be-the-last-man-standing-in-physical-video-games">Speaking with <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>last June</a>, managing director Nick Arran said the retailer "will be the last man standing selling physical games."</p>
<p>"We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioshock-ue5-imagining-halo-infinite-immortals-of-aveum-artist/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Bioshock Unreal Engine 5 fan concept video has been released, featuring Bioshock-themed environment art within Epic's game engine.</p>
<p>We've covered quite a bit of Unreal Engine 5 videos since the engine's release back in 2022, but we wanted to share this one as well as it comes from a former art designer on Microsoft's Halo Infinite, and the more recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-qa-amazon-confirms-amd-fsr-hdr-support-and-keyboard-mouse-option-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon's New World</a> - &nbsp;<a href="https://www.artstation.com/kalebnek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleb Nekumanesh</a>. As said, this nearly five-minute-long fan concept was created using Unreal Engine 5 using Megascans as well as custom models, materials, decals, and marketplace assets. It's an impressive video that shows what a modern-day Bioshock could like look. Check it out below, and tell us what you think below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bioshock Themed Ambience - Unreal Engine 5 Environment Art" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5P-mniYghI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an artist, Nekumanesh worked on various high-profile games, including Halo Infinite (Level Design and Gameplay Design), New World (Terrain and POI Artist), and Immortals of Aveum.</p>
<p>2007's Bioshock is being considered as one of the best games ever created. Some consider Bioshock 2 to be the better shooting game, but many would agree that the original Bioshock has the better story, atmosphere, and characters. As most of you will know, Bioshock creator Ken Levine is currently<a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> working on Judas</a>, which will have resemblances with Bioshock when it comes to weaponry and powers.</p>
<p>As for the Bioshock series - back in 2019, 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally confirmed</a> that a new entry in the franchise is in the works at developer Cloud Chamber. 2K President David Ismailer said, <em>"As we continue growing our product portfolio, we remain inspired by opportunities to invest further in our valuable IP, great people and their collective, long-term potential. BioShock is one of the most beloved, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. We can’t wait to see where its powerful narrative and iconic, first-person shooter gameplay head in the future with our new studio team at Cloud Chamber leading the charge."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24184636/diablo-4-season-5-ptr-quest-line-infernal-hordes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SxoxHP">Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know">has given a fairly comprehensive picture</a> of what to expect from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>’s fifth season in advance of a weeklong test on the game’s Public Test Realm (PTR).</p>
<p id="oE28Dm">The as-yet-untitled season 5, which begins on Aug. 6, will offer a new quest line that sounds as if it will lead into <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>’s first full expansion, which launches on Oct. 8. The main new feature will be a new wave-based gameplay mode, the Infernal Hordes, culminating in an endgame boss battle with multiple variations. The Unique item tier is getting an overhaul to make it more impactful, and new combos of weapon type and character class are being opened up.</p>
<p id="5tUIkU">There’s a slightly higher bar to clear to access the quest line and the Infernal Hordes this time. Previous seasons have required the player to complete <em>Diablo 4</em>’s campaign on one character to start the seasonal quest line. For season 5, you’ll need to enter the World Tier 3 difficulty to start the quest line. This means completing the campaign, reaching at least level 48, and then beating the Cathedral of Light “capstone” dungeon on World Tier 2. Most of the game’s dedicated players will have done all this a long time ago, but newer players brought in by the recent Game Pass launch or the excellent fourth season might want to go tick it off now.</p>
<p id="QEAbwx">Unlike the game’s first three seasons, however, which introduced new gameplay concepts for the length of the season only, it seems Blizzard is intent on making permanent additions and changes to <em>Diablo 4</em> with season 5, as it did with season 4. The new quest line will be available on both Seasonal and Eternal realms, and will remain on the Eternal Realm after the end of season 5. Blizzard’s description of season 5’s storyline — “enemies are cut-down, alliances shift, and unlikely friends emerge from the shadows” — sounds as if it might be setting the scene for <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, a suspicion further supported by the quest’s permanent nature.</p>
<p id="vBphh7">Infernal Hordes are unlocked at the end of the storyline and are intended to be a permanent new endgame activity to site alongside the Pit of Artificers dungeon introduced in season 4. In this mode, players enter Hell itself to defeat 90-second waves of enemies and collect Burning Aether to spend on loot and other rewards at the end of the run. In between each wave, players will choose from three Infernal Offers, which add gameplay modifiers to increase the difficulty and reward of each run.</p>
<p id="FcC5uo">Survive the Infernal Hordes and you will battle three of the five members of the Fell Council, corrupted priests from <em>Diablo 2</em> who have become champions of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred (and the main antagonist of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>).</p>
<div id="9KD2np"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-LVOWgIuo0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="eGYSgo">There are a ton of further changes, quality-of-life updates, and balance fixes to delve into in the full <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#Notes">patch notes</a> for the season 5 PTR and in the developers’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-LVOWgIuo0">campfire chat</a> stream. Highlights include: an overhaul of Unique items intended to make them more powerful, and to encourage players to change their character builds around them; the ultra-rare Uber Uniques now become Mythic Uniques, with their own item color and even drop sound; and new weapon types have been opened up for some classes, with Necromancers able to use maces and axes, Sorcerers able to use one-handed swords and maces, and Druids getting some new options, too.</p>
<p id="EQpWQ1">The PTR is available for PC players using Blizzard’s Battle.net launcher only, and the season 5 test runs for a week from tomorrow, Tuesday June 25. Season 5 begins on Aug. 6, and runs for a briefer-than-usual two months until season 6 begins alongside the launch of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> on Oct. 8.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/predatory-tactics-in-gaming-are-worse-than-you-think<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we think of predatory tactics in gaming, we often imagine deceptive UX designs, intrusive ads, or aggressive microtransactions. However, there are more insidious tactics that are rarely discussed, mainly because a lot of resources are spent hiding them to avoid backlash or even legal issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a player, have you ever felt like some games are intentionally making you lose or win? That there is an invisible hand manipulating the odds against you? That the game keeps holding you back despite investing money to progress faster? That you’re playing with different rules than others? While you might just be paranoid or unlucky, you could also be right.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want to shed light on a tactic that involves collecting data as you play, feeding this data into complex algorithms and models that then alter the rules of your game under the hood to optimize spending opportunities. This tactic is known by terms like ‘dynamic balancing,’ ‘personalization,’ ‘segmentation,’ and ‘targeting.’ Although these concepts are not new, the extent to which they impact modern games might surprise you. And it is often obfuscated behind manipulated randomness so that players don’t realize how much they are being conned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/mmo-dev-fined-record-breaking-dollar9-million-fee-for-misleading-players-over-microtransactions/">In the beginning of this year, Nexon was fined $9 million for manipulating the odds of their loot boxes to optimize spending opportunities.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In live-service games, manipulating randomness as Nexon did is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> an exception; it’s the norm. Many if not most studios operating live games do it to varying degrees (allegedly sometimes with good intentions, not all studios or F2P games are predatory) and a $9 million fine is nothing when your game’s lifetime revenue exceeds 5 billions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In essence, a live game is a software with thousands of variables, such as the difficulty of a level, the odds in loot boxes, or the price of an offer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you play online, every single interaction can be tracked, such as how much money you spend, how long your play sessions are, or how good you are at the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This data is analyzed and processed through various algorithms that can then change the variables in your game on the fly, putting you in situations where you’re more likely to spend. For instance, if you are progressing faster than the game wants you to, it might subtly become harder or reduce the chances of getting certain rewards. If you’re a big spender, the game might increase the price of offers you see. And this happens way more often than you think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It constantly adapts to your playing and spending behavior to keep you in what it considers the sweet spot of challenge and frustration. And it doesn’t care if it’s unfair, discriminatory, or predatory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, you might think, "If this were true, players would compare their game states and complain." This is where manipulated randomness comes into play, making it very difficult for the average player to notice or prove. When you can’t get that one random loot or win a level because the right gems don't appear, how can you prove the odds are skewed instead of you just being unlucky?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">TL;DR:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re playing a live service game, especially on mobile or a free-to-play game, there's a good chance that:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Winning or losing has little to do with your skill or luck; the outcome is decided before you even press the play button.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The randomness is manipulated. In match-3 games, for example, the gems may seem pre-generated or random, while in reality algorithms carefully choose the next gems to appear after each interaction to guarantee a near-loss or near-win situation when you run out of moves.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The disclosed odds are fake.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spending money can backfire on you and actually make your game harder. A classic example is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/activision-patents-reveal-sbmm-systems-potentially-used-in-modern-warfare-1296757/">SBMM matchmaking</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in pvp games: if you spend money to make your character more powerful, you may initially face weaker opponents to feel empowered, but over time you'll be matched against players who have also spent a lot and are equally or more powerful than you.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These games are designed to keep you in the frustration zone forever, regardless of how much money you spend. You can never truly "win" the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dynamic balancing also means that every player faces different difficulties and different sets of rules, which is the opposite of traditional games or sports where everyone plays by the same rules, or at least the rules are transparent for everyone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And this also reflected in the structure and roles of teams that operate live games, where it’s not uncommon to have more data scientists, data analysts, product managers, monetization managers, even psychologists to analyze players and refine these algorithms than creative people who produce the actual content of the game. And don’t get me wrong, data and monetization professions are needed for a functioning business, but when the creative people become a tiny percentage of the whole team (or decision owners), this shapes the game in a very different direction.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Do I Define ‘Predatory’?">How Do I Define ‘Predatory’?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common mistake is to blame the tools rather than the intention behind their use. Loot boxes, for example, aren’t inherently predatory; they can add an exciting and rewarding surprise element when balanced with noble intentions. Even dynamic balancing or manipulated randomness can enhance player experience. In some card games, the odds of opening a pack are manipulated in favor of the player, such as slightly increasing the chance of getting a legendary card every time you don’t get one. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>[Insert overwatch1lootbox image next to this paragraph]</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So the intention matters most. When designing a battle pass, a designer must answer questions like "How much faster should a premium player progress compared to a F2P player?" and "How long should it take for a player to finish the battle pass?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve seen designers balance it fairly, like by requiring 30 minutes of daily play to complete the free track or $5 to unlock the premium pass. But, I’ve also seen designers create an illusion of achievability by giving lots of free progress early on but then locking the juicy prize behind a $50 paywall or a ridiculous amount of grind, which is designed to frustrate 98% of players and milk the 2% whales.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It Has Nuances">It Has Nuances</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And it's up to players and studios to define where their red line is. 3 examples to illustrate that point:</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Loot Boxes Odds">Loot Boxes Odds</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loot boxes can have transparent, honest odds. But in more pernicious games, the odds change under the hood based on your game state. For example, you might have better odds after spending money or returning from a period of inactivity. Loot boxes can even have disclosed but fake odds, with collectables locked behind hidden conditions. You might spend thousands of $ trying to get a specific reward, without realizing that this collectible has in fact a 0% chance to drop, because it has a hidden condition that will only include it in the loot table 2 weeks from now (to prevent players from collecting everything Day 1).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laws that force developers to disclose the odds can be easily circumvented by generalizing the type of rewards. If it says ‘2% chances to get a rare card’, it could indeed give you a rare card with 2% chances, simply not the one it doesn’t want you to get.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And remember that any variable can be personalized, for example by skewing odds for whales while keeping them true for 98% of players, it muddies the water if players try to pull the numbers.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="BOTs in Multiplayer Games">BOTs in Multiplayer Games</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adding BOTs can ensure a smooth onboarding experience in multiplayer games, but it can also be used perniciously. In Moba ‘coop vs AI’, it’s clear that you’re battling BOTs for the sake of practicing. In many other games, like battle royale, weak BOTs are disguised as real players to trick you into thinking that you’re crushing it. It can go further, by making these fake-players difficult to beat unless you spend money, or even masquerading them as your Facebook friend on a leaderboard to create fake rivalry. If you’ve ever wondered why your auntie Nadine was top of the leaderboard at 4 AM on that old facebook game, it’s because it wasn’t her.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Charging Players Different Prices">Charging Players Different Prices</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Live games offer personalized deals, and as a rule of thumb, the more money you spend, the more expensive these offers get. Where it becomes even more shady is when these deals offer the same reward value, but for very different prices, sometimes by a large magnitude. Player A who is a non spender will get a ‘deal’ to buy a unique skin for 5$, while Player B, who is a whale will get a ‘deal’ to buy the same unique skin for 20$.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another developer stated:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>‘Well, we ended up with a model that basically targeted members of the Saudi royal family and charged them 100x what regular players would pay for the same microtransaction, and it worked..’</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Shall we do it?">Shall we do it?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a studio or developer, I believe it’s crucial to define your red lines, as less ethical people will always try to leave the morals out of the equation, ultimately worsening the game quality and the studio culture.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does it hurt the player experience for the sake of making more money?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the information transparent?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the information dishonest?</span></p></div></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it targeting vulnerable people?</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Put simply, as a developer, I ask myself "Would I be OK with it if this was done to me?".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, for a lot of decision owners, the "Shall we do it?" often turns into "How can we hide it better?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dynamic Balancing">Dynamic Balancing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand why dynamic balancing is such a powerful monetization tool and why studios invest heavily in fine-tuning it, we first need to examine how typical F2P games generate revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In F2P games, players engage with various systems where they make progress over time. Occasionally, a spike in difficulty slows this progression. To overcome these obstacles, players can either grind or pay to reduce the challenge, effectively buying time. This intentional difficulty spike, known as the "pinch," is designed to frustrate players just enough to encourage them to spend money, but not so much that they quit the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To maximize revenue, there are two main challenges to address.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first challenge is ensuring the balance between difficulty and player progress is just right. Various factors, such as skill, experience, playstyle, and the amount of money already invested, can influence this balance. If the game is too easy for them, Player A, who has a lot of experience and has already invested money to become more efficient, may not feel the need to spend money. If it's too hard, Player B, who is inexperienced and a non-spender may become overly frustrated and quit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">F2P games do not let players choose their own difficulty levels because this would undermine the game's monetization strategy. Instead, they dynamically adjust the difficulty based on data collected from players, ensuring each player remains in the optimal zone of frustration and challenge. The game creates the illusion that players are in control, while in reality, much of the experience is predetermined.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a RPG, Player A might receive worse loot than player B.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In a match-3 game, Player A might see less objective gem than player B</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In a shooter, Player A might have slightly smaller hitboxes than player B</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key is to always keep these changes as discreet as possible, often using manipulated randomness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second challenge is related to the concept of "spending depth"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Only a small percentage of players are willing to pay. It's much easier to extract money from these spenders than to convince non-spenders to start paying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're a player willing to spend $10,000 on a game, the game needs to give you reasons to spend more even after you've already invested $5,000.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In games with linear progression, spending $100 on resources boosts your progress, putting you ahead of the difficulty curve and reducing your need to spend for a long time, and it isn't efficient when targeting high-spenders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This can be addressed through exponential progression or… dynamic balancing. For example, if a player spends $100, the game lets them enjoy their power-spike for a while, but it soon adjusts the difficulty to match their new progression level.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, adaptive difficulty and manipulated randomness have been used in games for a long time and are not always bad. The experience can become more enjoyable when it subtly becomes easier after repeated failures, or when you’re matched against opponents with similar skill levels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in F2P live games, it’s often predatory for a combination of reasons:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making money has priority over the player experience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lack of Transparency: Players are unaware that many game variables are adjusted on the fly and differ from other players' experiences.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players cannot opt out of these adjustments.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many live games feature social elements like tournaments. It's as if regular players unknowingly compete and spend money to play against opponents with an aimbot.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players' spending can backfire. It’s as if, when playing Monopoly, spending $5 to guarantee a six on a dice roll would result in the game subtly increasing property prices to maintain the challenge.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With live games increasingly borrowing predatory tactics from casinos, we can even imagine&nbsp; that content creators could be sponsored to play games with manipulated odds, showcasing shiny rewards and ‘insane luck’&nbsp; to encourage their communities to spend money.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Can We Do About It?">What Can We Do About It?</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="As a player">As a player</h3><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Be aware: Understand that randomness in games is often manipulated and personalized. Investing money might not give you as much of an advantage as you think, and be aware that your game experience can differ significantly from other players.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">If a game studio you once cherished starts using more predatory tactics, don't expect it to revert to its previous ethical standards. The developers who opposed such tactics have left or lost their influence. If a studio backtracks due to backlash, they may often just try to hide their tactics better.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Support ethical studios: Choose to support game studios that align with your values</span></p></div></li><li></li></ol></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="As a developer">As a developer</h3><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Advocate for transparency: Transparency is crucial for healthy studios and games. Manipulating randomness to include elements players would disapprove of is a slippery slope.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Challenge unethical practices: Monetization stakeholders do not have a monopoly on ethics. If a tactic conflicts with your values, it is fair to openly challenge it.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But ultimately, I believe this can only be solved through creating and enforcing legislation.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Legislative Solutions">Legislative Solutions</h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">More user control over data: Ensure players have more control over the data collected while playing. Currently, opting out of data collection usually refers to personal data like country or name, not the data related to your playing and spending behaviors used for dynamic balancing.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Enforce full transparency: Many tactics are predatory because they are purposely obfuscated. Just as casinos must disclose their machine algorithms to third parties, large live games could be subject to similar transparency.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Licensing for game studios: Implement licensing for larger game studios to operate live games, with the possibility of revoking licenses if they breach contracts.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Spending limits: Many predatory practices target "whales" who spend thousands of dollars monthly. Implementing spending limits as China did could also be a solution.</span></p></div></li><li><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Increase fines: Increase penalties for unethical practices. A 9 million fine isn't doing much when the game generated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>5 billions.</span></span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mandatory offline modes: Require standard game states or offline modes.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Closing words"><span>Closing words</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many modern live games are not just gambling machines disguised as video games, they are often rigged on top of it, not so different from carnival games that set you up to lose.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My intent here is not to blame specific games or studios, but to highlight the root of predatory tactics to help players recognize them and encourage developers to speak out. While some developers might not mind working for studios that use these tactics—especially given the high pay and benefits that often go with them— when you’re driven by passion, it's not great to work on a project knowing it’s meant to trick children or seniors into spending money, it's not great to see talented colleagues leave or stop caring because their ethics no longer align with studio practices. It's not great to pour years of your life into crafting art, code, design only to see your craft being torn apart by players because of how greedy the monetization is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I talked with community managers who burned out because they had to defend predatory tactics they were not responsible for. And I see the hypocrisy of studios that like to brag about how inclusive they are,&nbsp; while simultaneously using the most unethical ways to milk their players. It's almost as if ethics matter as long as they don’t make you lose money.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And I wish, we developers would challenge these practices more often in our studios or in the industry. If an artist or a writer produces something controversial, a lot of colleagues rightfully feel they should speak against it. But when someone in charge of the monetization decides it’s okay to scam elderly or children, surprisingly, very few people dare to speak against them, often because there is no room for debates, or because the other developers might not even be aware of how predatory their own game can be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A quick glance at this year’s GDC conference, the largest event for developers, reveals how little we address this issue. Among hundreds of sessions and a whole advocacy category, I found a</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/dark-patterns-shining-a-light-on-unlawful-game-design/900015"> single session that explicitly focuses on unethical tactics.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I believe it deserves more attention, games-as-a-service become the norm, and these tactics generate billions. These billions are re-invested in ads or user acquisition and makes it harder for more ethical studios to gain visibility and stand out. And the way studios monetize their players is not only reflected in the lower quality of the games, but also the studio brand, culture, values and the talents who decide to join or stay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So for once instead of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4&amp;t=39s">‘leaving the morality for the end’</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, let’s please ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GiLZ2YoHSc&amp;t=44m">slow down on the greed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">’</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Do you want to know how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://puzzmo.com/">Puzzmo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> co-creator Zach Gage prototyped his latest project? We thought you might. Earlier this month, we sat down with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TypeShift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Knotwords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> designer to learn more about his new bitesized newspaper puzzler, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (PUP).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our chat, Gage explained how the project changed dramatically throughout production–bouncing back from a brief cancellation to become one of the most popular offerings on Hearst's burgeoning puzzle platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also glimpsed four work-in-progress versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that provide a clear look at how the project became waylaid before being reshaped into something much more approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage has kindly granted us permission to share images of those early incarnations, along with his annotations, to help you understand why the title was scrapped and subsequently reforged, eventually becoming the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://puzzmo.com/game/pile-up-poker">experimental card-based conundrum you see today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v0 (Feb 23)"><span>PUP–v0 (Feb 23)</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was the earliest playable version of the game. Gage notes that with this initial prototype, his goal was to "get a digital version [out] as fast as possible and to focus more on aiding playability than adding constraints."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In this version we could place cards anywhere on the grid. When we tested this, pretended there were rules around placement instead of implementing them with code," he adds. "This made it quicker to program and preserved more flexibility for us to make and try rule changes in our heads (without needing code changes)."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Below are the rules of this first iteration:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You may move up to four cards per turn Cards may be moved to the top most empty row, or any row already containing cards</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You may not move cards to multiple rows at the same time</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each turn you may only move up to n-1 cards, where n is the number you moved last turn. So if I moved three cards on turn one, I could only move up to two on turn two</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you "stand" your moves are reset back to four and you are dealt the next hand up</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal here, according to Gage, was to try and make the best 12 poker hands (based on horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matches). The joker was a wild-card that counted as the best card for each different hand it featured in. The card peeking out of the back of the draw pile was the last card players would draw.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v1 (March 6)">PUP–v1 (March 6)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, the Puzzmo team were enjoying PUP-0 so focused on improving playability by including "more legible card-art, implementing a multiplier based on how many hands you've made, and showing the hand information next to each scored hand."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can see a lot of design ideas from this version made their way into the final version of the game. If you're really eagle-eyed you might notice that the suit-art and cards we used in this version are pulled right out of Flipflop Solitaire," adds Gage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These prior iterations of the game were very technical to play and good strategy involves using the cards you discard to line things up vertically, since the cards shift left to fill gaps."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v2 (March 15)">PUP–v2 (March 15)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A big change in this version saw Gage experiment with the idea of a "discard to the void" move that players could deploy while also shifting cards up the board.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had three true discards for the whole game, and using them counted as a move (for both the number of moves we'd get next turn, and the number of moves we had this turn)," continues Gage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal with this idea was to make the end-rounds of the game feel less railroad-y. We were finding that the final two turns of the game had almost no decision-points. Adding in the optional discard, if players preserved it to the end, really opens up the end-game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Puzzmo team also continued to add visual polish with PUP–v2, using outlines to clarify where you could place cards. The yellow bars denote 'bonus hands,' which are randomized each game and worth 2x the value of all other hands.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PUP–v3 (April 2)">PUP–v3 (April 2)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage says PUP-v3 is where things began to get a "little weird and/or unhinged." A big change saw the team try moving discarded cards to the back of the draw-deck instead of the void.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Instead of deleting cards, we're passing them to ourselves later," explains Gage. "This enables a ton of really interesting strategies around the discard move and creates a very interesting and dynamic end-game. Suddenly we had to balance our current row, the spots we can move cards to, and the 1-4 cards we've discarded against each-other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Ultimately, this version of the game is the most technical and the most interesting, but it felt to me like too much work to play, and even worse, too much work to explain."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The complexity seen in PUP–v3 drove Gage to (briefly) cancel the project. It was, of course, pulled back from the brink after the Puzzmo team offered a few choice pointers that helped Gage reshape </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into something altogether more fluid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more on what happened next, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-pile-up-poker-survived-cancellation-to-become-a-puzzmo-hit">read our full interview with Gage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>I have recently moved to an area that’s surrounded by forest, or at least, by swathes of greenery that feel like forests when you’re far enough inside them, even if they don’t meet whatever quantifiable definition is currently in vogue. My dreams are ablaze with scenes of sunlight percolating through shifting layers of beech and oak, with visions of dirt paths winding through bramble. Now, here comes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/engraving">Engraving</a> to transform all those dreams into nightmares. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>In this occult first-person mystery-horror, you explore a forest that is also a graveyard and, moreover, stuffed to the crannies with ancient curses and restless spectres, some of them distressingly though not entirely arachnid in derivation. Your chief means of overcoming these hazards is your ability to draw maps. The trouble is, when you sleep all of your maps become obsolete. Catch the trailer down the page there, poking its mishappen visage out of the undergrowth like a skeleton spiderman that wants to eat your ankles.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>The work of Raffaele Picca, who is also working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">that game about the giant planetary defence cannon</a>, Engraving (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616650/Engraving/">Steam link here</a>) casts you as Silas, “a man once motivated by greed, now entangled in an intricate web of ancient curses and haunting spirits.” Play consists of stomping through distinct named regions, including a few catacombs, in order to learn about the spectres that inhabit this clearly far from National Trust-endorsed stretch of woodland. As you go, you can sketch portions of the forest on paper, but beware, Silas needs to sleep occasionally, and every time he does, the forest changes shape.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s got some procgen, and I’m aware that a lot of people are tired of procgen, but the ambience seems promising. While Silas seemingly lacks for a weapon or other way of defending himself, Picca’s tweets suggest he can portal into a parallel dimension, the Nether, to avoid certain nasties, with the strong caveat that the Nether harbours a few nasties of its own.</p>
<p>Featured by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/engraving">Screenshot Saturday Mondays</a> back in February, but discovered by me only today, Engraving has the makings of a cool conceptual horror game. I don’t find it quite as alarming as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silkbulb-tests-demo-is-a-fun-quiz-game-as-long-as-you-ignore-the-noises-and-dont-look-behind-you%E2%80%9D">Silkbulb Test</a> but I find it creepier than what I’ve played of Still Wakes The Deep, though admittedly I’ve only played about 30 minutes of that. This feels like a good moment to dust off Adam Smith’s (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/videogame-maps">paean to videogame cartography</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts.909531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>11.6 million PC and console games were sold across European markets in May. Compared with the same five week period in 2023, that's a drop of nearly 17%.</p>
<p>This is GSD figures, which tracks all digital game sales from most major publishers (Nintendo data is absent), and physical game sales in all major European markets.</p>
<p>The main reason for the drop is that last year we had the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which was a major hit. To put it into context, Zelda alone sold more copies in May 2023 than the entire Top Ten sold in May 2024. Last year also saw the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4 and Xbox One, which was also a strong performer.</p>
<p>The No.1 selling game in May this year was EA Sports FC 24, followed by Grand Theft Auto 5. F1 2024 races in at No.3, which launches a good two weeks earlier this year. However, the Codemasters game has got off to a slow start, with launch sales down 35% over last year's game.</p>
<p>The PC release of Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut sends the PlayStation game up to No.4. Meanwhile, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door comes in at No.5. Nintendo does not share digital sales with the charts, so the game may have charted higher in reality.</p>
<p>Looking at similar games, the new Paper Mario's sales are down 8% compared with the opening two weeks of last year's Super Mario RPG, and 8.5% lower than 2020's Paper Mario: The Origami King.</p>
<p>Finally, Star Wars-related pricing activity had sent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order back into the Top Ten.</p>
<p><strong>Console sales fall sharply on tough Switch comparisons</strong></p>
<p>Across the tracked markets, 311,000 games consoles were sold in May 2023, which is a drop of 40% over the same period the year before.</p>
<p>All console platforms saw a big drop, with Nintendo Switch suffering the biggest fall. Again, this is because last May saw the release of Zelda and a special Zelda edition of the OLED Switch model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, accessory sales fell 25% for the same five-week period, once again led by the DualSense controller (which actually saw sales rise year-on-year).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As Drive to Survive has reignited interest in racing’s premiere category and made superstars of everyone from drivers to strategists in the last five years, it’s the on-track action that remains at the centre of every F1 calendar. Luckily, while Max Verstappen still keeps on winning this year, it’s been far from last year’s processional exhibition, and video game fans won’t feel like they’re living in a complete fantasy world when beating him to the top step of the podium in the latest of EA and Codemasters’ yearly F1 titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 Season 1 - Charles Leclerc Challenge Career" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vtyu2UC2Duo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EA Sports F1 24 continues the push for further realism, and alongside the expected tweaks and buffs there are some wholly changed or renewed systems that make this the best rendition of digital F1 racing we’ve ever had.</p>


<p>Driver Career mode gives you the choice between taking a created player of your own to the top of the podium, stepping into the shoes of your favourite driver, or creating an unlikely storyline where Logan Sargeant becomes World Champion. If you really wanted to.</p>
<p>Overall, Codemasters has made some big improvements to the Driver Career, making it feel all the more like you’re crafting your own storyline. You now work towards upgrading your driver’s stats, and you’re given a steady stream of objectives to incrementally move you towards taking P1. I was disappointed by the limited create-a-player options, with pre-set builds to choose form, but I understand that it’s likely to improve the parity between the real-world drivers and your racer.</p>

<p>There’s further inclusions, such as secret driver meetings where other teams court your interest, that really feel true to the behind-the-scenes action that are constantly whispered about in the paddock. Fundamentally, everything just feels a bit more more in depth, while staying true to the sport and its surrounding circus.</p>

<p>You can also run a complete two-player Driver Career, and we spent a lot of time in this mode, going head-to-head while also building our own path through the career. Sometimes load times can feel a little lengthy here while both players are working their way through menus, but the on-track action is rock solid and responsive. The biggest downside? There are few things more sobering though than the fact your son now beats you at an F1 racing game – I’d argue that he has too much time on his hands to practice.</p>
<p>While Driver Career has taken a step forward, there are few meaningful changes to My Team mode, though for many, creating your own team will be enough. You still control a driver alongside their team, but many of the most interesting new additions to the Driver Career mode haven’t been brought across, such as the secret meetings between drivers or the driver rivalries – in fairness, you’re basically playing as Lance and Lawrence Stroll bundled into one in this mode. While you can haggle with sponsors, and control a few more elements behind the scenes, it leaves My Team feeling like a missed opportunity, and I can see plenty of players choosing the main Driver Career over it.</p>

<p>To keep players coming back beyond their own stardom, Codemasters has added an episodic Challenge Career, where you’re given a series of missions to complete, with a set of cosmetic rewards to deck your driver out with. The first of these saw Max Verstappen choosing a small selection of his favourite race tracks and tasked you with finishing them in the highest position.</p>
<p>Each challenge hangs around for a week, before moving onto the next episode. It’s a great bite-sized mode, which doesn’t ask too much of your time, and it allows you to build your racer’s wardrobe – even if the most recent one is a horrible purple outfit that I’ll never, ever use.</p>
<p>While we can argue all day about horrible colour schemes, the visuals are sharper and distinctly more impressive than last year’s outing. The driver facial models are now incredibly lifelike, and various tracks look closer than ever to their real-world equivalent. Spa Francochamps in particular has seen a big improvement in visual fidelity, and it’s far more vibrant and realistic than last year’s overly dull rendition.</p>

<p>We’ve encountered a few bugs during our time with F1 24, including some penalties not being handed out for making changes to your engine during or after qualifying, and a few AI hiccups where an entire field of cars failed to put on wet tyres for the start of a race despite it absolutely chucking it down. Neither of these were disastrous – the second one obviously helped us out – but hopefully the few rough edges can be shaved off by an update.</p>
<p>At release, there were several vocal complaints about this year’s handling model, particularly if you used a steering wheel, and Codemasters has steadily tried to respond to these, with the most recent patch attempting to further address player’s difficulties.</p>
<p>The initial handling model felt good with a controller, but as we’ve leaned into playing more with our Thrustmaster wheel, the latest update feels more consistent and responsive than before. If it doesn’t quite feel right to you out of the box, there are various settings that you can tweak to personalise it to your liking, but for my personal taste, it’s just as accurate and enjoyable as it was last year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-20-patch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/full-cities-skylines-2-economy-2-0-patch-notes-revealed-as-huge-update-goes-live.909519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-20-patch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has released a major new&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's a very big one indeed, bringing overhauls to economic systems, a building upgrade rework, and more.</p>
<p>The Economy 2.0 update has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-rework-creator-packs">a long time in the making</a>, but it's finally here, and the patch notes are just as extensive as you'd expect from an update with a name as bold as Economy 2.0 (and hey, let's face it - that's a sexier name than 1.1.5f1).</p>
<p>The aforementioned building upgrade rework gives you more control over the Selected Info Panel's building upgrade feature; you can control which upgrade types you want to see, and you can relocate or remove sub-buildings as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-economy-2.0-patch-notes-aerial.jpg?itok=569BcoSC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-economy-2.0-patch-notes-aerial.jpg?itok=kn2_pMhl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>has just received a major new update.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, as the name suggests, this update is all about&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s economy, and the list of changes to the game's economic systems is truly extensive.</p>
<p>Changes have been made to features like area demand, employment, city services, and crime rates, and a number of other changes have also been implemented, including increased map tile cost, an option to unlock all map tiles (which also disables achievements), and much more.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">major performance improvements</a> have been implemented in this patch, the answer is yes, but those improvements are relatively limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update brings various UI optimizations, as well as improved FPS when "placing complex buildings or roads", but there aren't any massive, sweeping visual or performance boosts in this one.</p>

<p>So, what's next for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>now that the Economy 2.0 patch is upon us? This update contributed to delays to the game's upcoming Creator Packs, which are included in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-roadmap-modding-update-release-date">most recent roadmap</a>, so hopefully, we'll get to see those being released sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>There's also the console release of&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">delayed again back in April</a>&nbsp;and which is now targeting an October release window (although Paradox says that even meeting this target might be difficult).</p>
<p>We'll likely hear more about Paradox's plans for the game in the coming weeks, although information will likely be scarce within the next month or so owing to Finnish developer Colossal Order's summer break.</p>
<p><em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;is available right now on PC via either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cities-skylines-ii/9NH213LRNGPC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and it's also available as part of a PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

            <p>Diablo 4's Season 5 will introduce a new wave-based rogue-lite mode.</p>
<p>By using an Infernal Compass – which scales in difficulty and world tier – players will be able to unlock the Infernal Hordes mode wherein they'll earn Burning Aether "to unlock powerful weapons and rewards".</p>
<p>Successfully slay the Hordes, and you'll be asked to take on the powerful Fell Council, which consists of three random minibosses. Successfully defeat them, and you'll be able to spend your Burning Aether on "Spoils of Hell" – Spoils of Equipment, Materials, Gold, or Greater Equipment – which guarantees an item with a Greater Affix.</p>

<p>Each time-limited wave will last 90 seconds, after which you'll have to defeat whatever foes remain before choosing between three Boons &amp; Banes – called Infernal Offers – that will modify your run. As these modifiers will stack, Blizzard warns players to "choose wisely" and, as you may well expect, the harder the difficulty, the better the rewards.</p>
<p>"Helltides were only the beginning of the horrors lying in wait," the Diablo 4 team teases. "Confront seemingly endless waves of Hell's Legions in the Realm of Hatred, as the Infernal Hordes grow more powerful with each passing day."</p>
<p>Interested? You can access the new mode early if you participate in the Public Test Realm (PTR), which is running for a week from tomorrow, Tuesday 25th June. The PTR will close on 2nd July. For everyone else, you'll have to wait until Season 5 goes live. Sorry.</p>

<p>As a thank you "for being part of the Diablo community through another year of fighting back the demonic forces of Hell", the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-celebrates-its-first-anniversary-by-giving-you-a-goblins-heap-of-free-gifts">March of the Goblins event</a> – which kicked off at the beginning of this month across both Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal – had "a goblin's heap of rewards" to give away to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Whilst the franchise has long been associated with its dedicated PC fanbase, an email sent from Xbox president Sarah Bond in April intimated that Diablo 4 – which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">acquired by Microsoft as part of its $68.7m acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, of course – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-the-number-one-platform-for-diablo-4-players-says-xbox-president">is more popular on the Xbox console system</a>, even though the RPG is also available on PC and PlayStation consoles, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aska-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are the last man standing after a terrible cataclysm, but you won't be alone forever — in&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>, you can transform one lonely person on an island into the head of a Viking village filled with talented craftsmen and mighty warriors.</p>
<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dab330ac-4284-4049-a45e-f654eba2a7d9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/aska"><em>Aska</em></a>&nbsp;is one of those rare games that somewhat successfully blends two genres; in this case, it's part survival game and party colony sim. You can build anywhere on a massive island, get dozens of villagers, and go toe-to-toe against mighty monsters. I enjoyed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="135e6532-42c4-4195-adde-42e91fce15d0" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/aska-preview-interview">checking it out</a> back in April of this year, and I was excited to see how the final product turned out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aska-final-preview-expanding-a-settlement.jpg?itok=ruBwJP7x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aska-final-preview-expanding-a-settlement.jpg?itok=a2-on_g1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expanding your settlement can be difficult if you don't have a robust infrastructure with several villagers helping you.</figcaption></figure><h2>Starting Civilization from Scratch</h2>
<p>The key premise of&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;is your adventure in restarting civilization from nothing. You land on an island after your boat is smashed to bits with nothing to your name except the clothes on your back and a canteen of sorts. With just a little bit of elbow grease, you'll soon be the head of a bustling village.</p>
<p>Your new village can be placed virtually anywhere on the massive island that is now your new home, and you can choose to populate it with a few villagers, dozens of villagers, or no villagers whatsoever. There is a fair amount of freedom in deciding your ultimate strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, you probably could play Aska by yourself or with some friends — it would just take much longer than it should.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You and your villagers will depend on buildings to gather <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="295b1366-075a-41c4-a1a9-6d248587c4f0" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-resources-guide-how-to-get-crafting-materials">resources</a>, grow and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76eec3db-e9de-4185-ac7a-50528354bf07" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-cooking-and-food-guide">cook food</a>, and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b7bf401b-71ae-46f0-869e-a30a4cdba225" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-crafting-and-unlocks-guide">craft new items</a>. All of these buildings need to be defended, too, so a portion of your population will almost certainly be assigned to defend it. You'll need the help — you can expect an attack once every few in-game days, and each winter ends with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94ccc7cc-f31f-47c6-95ec-afb308e3313b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-invasion-guide-how-to-defend-your-village">a large invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you probably could play&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;by yourself or with some friends — it would just take much longer than it should. Though you have to provide for your villagers' needs, they also considerably speed up construction and resource collection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aska-final-preview-fighting-enemies-outside-of-town.jpg?itok=qGkM_2AA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aska-final-preview-fighting-enemies-outside-of-town.jpg?itok=mEhHFIj4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Villagers can be trained in combat and they will assist you when enemies attack.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fair, Unforgiving, and Utterly Mystifying</h2>
<p>Part of the appeal of&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;is the challenge of it. The game never feels unfair, but it also doesn't do the best job of communicating critically important information to the player.</p>
<p>Take the monster spawners as an example. In my first failed playthrough, I built my settlement a little too close to some ruins that, unbeknownst to me, endlessly spawned skeletons. I spent half of my playtime killing skeletons that were beating on my wall.</p>
<p>It's totally fair to suffer the consequences of building near a monster spawner. What's somewhat less fair is the fact that I had no way of knowing that that was a monster spawner that could not be destroyed. It took quite a few hours before I realized my situation was untenable and I had to restart. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>On a similar note, critical locations on a map (such as the aforementioned monster spawner) are not marked in any way. You only have one waypoint, so you can't mark them yourself, either. These are some of the many pieces of information that&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;should give you but doesn't.</p>
<p>This information deficit makes learning how to play <i>Aska</i>&nbsp;a trial-and-error experience. You'll gain the inkling of some new mechanic or strategy, only to learn that it's easier to start over and integrate this knowledge into your next attempt rather than continue on with a flawed strategy that's difficult to fix.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aska-final-preview-farmers-who-need-rakes-annoying-me.jpg?itok=kZwhjeNL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aska-final-preview-farmers-who-need-rakes-annoying-me.jpg?itok=Pm1j2lnm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Villagers with serious problems (such as a lack of tools) will follow you around until you interact with them and find out what's wrong. Many critical pieces of information can only be discovered by talking to people.</figcaption></figure><h2>Automation Frustration</h2>
<p>For a game that depends on automation,&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;is sorely lacking some much-needed features for managing your Settlement and the villagers that live within it. The current state of the Early Access launch is something of an exercise in frustration and micromanagement at times.</p>
<p>Farming is one particularly frustrating area. Each season, certain crops can no longer be grown and other crops must replace them. You can automate the planting and harvesting of crops on a per-season basis, but you must manually swap the crops in the Farm's menu each season.</p>
<p>This seems like a terrible oversight, especially considering how important a good food supply is for your village. The ability to automatically rotate crops based on the season can and should have been available right from the get-go. Instead, farming is a chore of micromanaging what gets planted where throughout the year.</p>
<p>Another issue is the fact that there is no reliable way to make villagers&nbsp;<em>avoid</em>&nbsp;an area. One of my playthroughs was ruined simply by the fact that my villagers kept running past a particularly dangerous respawning monster. I could place no flag or marker that would tell them to avoid that area. This is a feature that's badly needed in a future update.</p>
<p>Comparable games will provide statistics of incoming and outgoing supplies, allowing you to understand any deficiencies in your strategy at a glance.&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;doesn't do the greatest job of keeping you informed about small problems in your Settlement that could snowball into something bigger such as your farmers lacking tools.</p>
<p>These problems are compounded by the fact that it takes 10 minutes to summon a new villager and you can only summon one at a time. If some kind of disaster strikes or you lose a major battle, you'll spend hours recovering your population — and the gaps in your economy could have a devastating cascade effect for the rest of your people.</p>

You can quickly lose everything if you're not prepared.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Aska</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>It may sound like I dislike&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>, but that's not the case. I genuinely think that this is one of the most interesting survival games and colony sims to make its way onto Steam in some time.&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;masterfully blends two genres into a single, compelling package — but the rough edges make what could have been a great game fall a bit short.</p>
<p>I think that many of these issues could be solved with some design changes. If the devs can improve the automation options and give the player a little more useful information, I could see&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;being the sort of game that you can comfortably sink hundreds of hours into by yourself or with your friends.</p>
<p>For now, gamers who are willing to learn and deal with a bit of jank will find&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;a fun challenge. I think it could turn into a simply amazing game with the right tweaks and improvements. One hopes that the developers will use the Early Access period to sort these problems out post haste.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Aska</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>was previewed on PC via Steam Early Access with a code provided by the developer over the course of 150 hours of gameplay; all screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183267/house-dragon-episode-season-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4spIix">Even for the work of George R.R. Martin, the tragedy du jour that sets season 2 of <em>House of the Dragon</em> in motion is a bracingly terrible moment. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">casual beheading of Jaehaerys Targaryen</a> — while off screen in the moment, grimly recalled this week via stitches on a corpse — is depicted as a bridge too far, even for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained">the brutal world of Westeros</a>. The people devoted to preserving the norms of the realm are losing their grip, as the bloody game of eye-for-an-eye has led to this race to the bottom. </p>
<p id="NV7MpC">It’s early in the game, but <em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 seems devoted to mapping, in painstaking detail, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1">how a war starts</a>. It’s the Kübler-Ross model but for armed conflict <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review">instead of grief</a>. If “A Son for a Son” is denial, this week’s episode is anger. Or more aptly, fury — power is, if nothing else, a force multiplier. As Madam Sylvi (Michelle Bonnard) tells <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23946625">Aemond</a> when he curls up in her arms to express remorse over killing Jace, “When princes lose their temper it is often others who suffer.”</p>
<p id="gheXkY">Doubly so, then, for kings: Aegon’s fury over his son’s death has rendered him virtually inert in his position, but that doesn’t mean his small council isn’t ready to use it as kindling for the coming conflict. Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) spins his grandchild’s death into powerful propaganda, sending the infant corpse in a funeral procession through King’s Landing to turn the public further against Rhaenyra, who stooped so low as to murder a child in their bed. “Jaehaerys will do more for us now than a thousand knights in battle,” Otto says of his grim spectacle.</p>
<p id="M0ByDQ">This is, however, the last bit of savvy politicking within the Red Keep. Rage soon rebuilds the power structure in its image. Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), in a decision that is sure to see blowback, orders all of the ratcatchers in King’s Landing killed, and dismisses Otto from his position of Hand, installing Ser Criston Cole — who sent Ser Arryk to assassinate Rhaenyra — instead. It’s a petty act from a boy-king who demands satisfaction and is frustrated by the constraints of the crown. Otto, however, sees something more dire than the loss of his position — to Otto, what the very throne represents is at stake. </p>

Aegon <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405183/house-dragon-review-episode-9-alicent-aegon-rhaenys">was always a poor candidate for the Iron Throne</a>, one intended to be more of a figurehead that would allow the biggest stakeholders in Viserys’ court to retain their little fiefdoms — and most importantly to Otto, secure the Hightowers within King’s Landing. Unfortunately for that crowd, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405130/house-dragon-why-rhaenys-doesnt-kill-aegon-dragon-murder">the quiet coup that put him on the throne</a> led to a set of circumstances Aegon is uniquely ill-equipped to handle.</p>
<p id="t4kvt1">Otto knows he has compromised those principles, and the crown, by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23367111/house-dragon-time-jumps-years-timeline">conspiring to install Aegon</a>, and is operating under the assumption that the preserving power of norms will paper over Aegon’s fraudulent rule and its damage to the throne’s integrity. He’s mistaken, obviously — we are in the sending assassins and killing infants and hanging innocent exterminators phase of Aegon’s reign; norms are as dead as Jaehaerys. </p>

<p id="Tzf1bt">Principled men fall one by one in order to make way for men who clamor for war.<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> underscores this with one final small tragedy, as the twins <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403463/house-dragon-twins-names-actors-cast-arryk-erryk-yes-really">Arryk and Erryk</a> (Elliott Tittensor and Luke Tittensor) confront each other with Rhaenyra’s life in the balance. The brothers’ split along ideological lines was one of the quieter rifts in the show’s first season, made no less devastating by their idealism, and the belief in the nobility of their position in the Kingsguard. </p>
<p id="cTvamL">Director Clare Kilner stages the twins’ sad, desperate struggle so that, eventually, it is impossible to tell them apart. Its terrible conclusion, in which one brother emerges victorious only to impale himself on his sword, can be read multiple ways — as one brother unable to live without the other, or as Erryk realizing that he will never fully have Rhaenyra’s trust and therefore will not be able to fulfill his duty, or as some combination of the two. Death, then, is better than a life of suspicion or compromise. There is a metaphor here. </p>
<p id="REOevj">It is a terrible thing to measure one life over another, and yet that’s what the power structure of King’s Landing — what any power structure, really — depends on. Jaehaerys’ funeral procession is a powerful message but it is also built on a fiction: that any other dead child killed in their bed would matter just as much. That is patently untrue. So many more children are now going to die, to avenge the deaths of two. </p>

            <p>Xbox leaders in AI and cloud will be our final keynote session for GI Sprint next week.</p>
<p>Haiyan Zhang, general manager of Gaming AI at Xbox, and Brady Woods, product leader at Xbox Game Creator Services, will discuss how the latest technology can help game developers build their games better and more efficiently.</p>
<p>The session will be available to view online, listen as a podcast or read as an article on <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> on Wednesday, July 3rd.</p>
<p>GI Sprint is our a new editorial series, featuring video panels, podcasts, interviews, articles and more on the subject of making video games 'cheaper, faster and better'.</p>
<p>In the face of rising development costs, we've spoken to an array of experts about a range of subjects that will help studios improve the efficiency of their businesses and development processes. This special will run until Friday, July 5.</p>
<p>We kicked the series off last week with an interview featuring games veteran and former PlayStation boss <strong>Shawn Layden</strong>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-laydens-advice-on-making-games-faster-and-cheaper">who discussed the unsustainability of AAA video games</a> and why it needs rethinking. We have also spoken to IO Interactive CTO <strong>Ulas Karademir</strong> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/io-interactives-mission-to-speed-up-game-development-gi-sprint">on his return to the Hitman studio</a> and the opportunities offered by having in-house tech.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-devs-need-to-fail-fast-and-how-to-do-so-gi-sprint">hosted a panel on the art of failing fast,</a> featuring <strong>Rami Ismail</strong>, FreeLives' <strong>Dominique Gawlowski</strong> and Ant Workshop's <strong>Tony Gowland</strong>. While we also featured<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singles-not-albums-a-guide-to-making-smaller-games-gi-sprint"> a standalone piece with Gowland</a> on developing shorter games.</p>
<p>This week, we have a video panel on how AI can (and cannot) speed up development. King's AI lead <strong>Sahar Asadi</strong> will share with us her experience of using the technology with Candy Crush, while Team Sync's <strong>Graham McAllister</strong> will tell us why the concept stage is the most important one to get right when it comes to team efficiency.</p>
<p>Then next week, we have videos, podcasts and articles covering topics such as hybrid working, the advantages of a lean team, and more. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events/gi-sprint-summer-2024">You can see the full schedule here.</a></p>
<p>We will conclude the event with a White Paper collating all the articles in one place, and it's free to download.</p>
<p>Various sponsorship packages are available for GI Sprint, for both this even and our next one. Contact <a href="mailto:George.Corner@Gamesindustry.biz">George.Corner@Gamesindustry.biz</a> for more details.</p>

            <p>War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment has issued an apology after it accidentally included imagery from the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in a piece of key art.</p>
<p>The error was quickly noticed by members of the War Thunder community, who shared the image on the game's forum and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a> to show how the artwork lined up with images of the 1986 disaster. This real-world incident resulted in the death of all seven crew members on board the space shuttle.</p>
<p>"Maybe it was an accident on the part of the artist, but it seems in incredibly poor taste," one poster wrote on the War Thunder forum.</p>

<p>Gaijin Entertainment has now acknowledged this error. "Please accept our sincere apologies for this, the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost," community manager <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/25">magazine2</a> wrote on the forum.</p>
<p>"We'll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn't repeat again in the future."</p>
<p>A similar statement was also shared by War Thunder's international community manager Oxy on reddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/comment/l9vr7e0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Oxy</a> said the artwork will be changed today (Monday), adding: "sorry everyone, things like this shouldn't happen."</p>
<p>War Thunder has previously made headlines due to players leaking classified military documents to the game's forums. </p>
<p>This has included a flight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/military-documents-leak-once-again-on-war-thunder-forum">manual for the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classified-military-documents-leaked-on-war-thunder-forum-for-third-time">documents of the DTC10-125 Chinese anti-tank missile</a> and documents on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yet-more-military-documents-leaked-on-war-thunder-forum">F-16 fighter jet</a>, which were shared by one player in an attempt to win an argument with another member of the game's community.</p>

<p>John Romero remembers the moment he realized what the future of gaming would look like.</p>
<p>In late 1991, Romero and his colleagues at id Software had just released <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>, a crude-looking, <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/EGA_Palette">EGA-colored</a> first-person shooter that was nonetheless revolutionary compared to other first-person games of the time. "When we started making our 3D games, the only 3D games out there were nothing like ours," Romero told Ars in a recent interview. "They were lockstep, going through a maze, do a 90-degree turn, that kind of thing."</p>
<p>Despite <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>'s technological advances in first-person perspective, though, Romero remembers the team at id followed its release by going to work on the next entry in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/bethesda-revives-80s-pc-series-commander-keen-as-a-free-to-play-mobile-game/">the long-running <em>Commander Keen</em> series</a> of 2D platform games. But as that process moved forward, Romero told Ars that something didn't feel right.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nej9F6jj_rA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Catacombs 3-D</em> is less widely remembered than its successor, <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I'm just like, 'Guys we need to not make this game [<em>Keen</em>],'" he said. "'This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with <em>Catacomb</em>.' ... And everyone was immediately was like, 'Yeah, you know, you're right. That is the new thing, and we haven't seen it, and we can do it, so why aren't we doing it?'"</p>
<p>The team started working on <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> that very night, Romero said. And the rest is history.</p>
<h2>Going for speed</h2>
<p>What set <em>Catacomb 3-D</em> and its successors apart from other first-person gaming experiments of the time, Romero said, "was our speed—the speed of the game was critical to us having that massive differentiation. Everyone else was trying to do a world that was proper 3D—six degrees of freedom or representation that was really detailed. And for us, the way that we were going to go was a simple rendering at a high speed with good gameplay. Those were our pillars, and we stuck with them, and that's what really differentiated them from everyone else."</p>
<p>That focus on speed extended to id's development process, which Romero said was unrecognizable compared to even low-budget indie games of today. The team didn't bother writing out design documents laying out crucial ideas beforehand, for instance, because Romero said "the design doc was next to us; it was the creative director... The games weren't that big back then, so it was easy for us to say, 'this is what we're making' and 'things are going to be like this.' And then we all just work on our own thing."                                            </p>

<p>The early id designers didn't even use basic development tools like version control systems, Romero said. Instead, development was highly compartmentalized between different developers; "the files that I'm going to work on, he doesn't touch, and I don't touch his files," Romero remembered of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/dooms-romero-and-carmack-will-reunite-for-30th-anniversary-streaming-event/">programming games alongside John Carmack</a>. "I only put the files on my transfer floppy disk that he needs, and it's OK for him to copy everything off of there and overwrite what he has because it's only my files, and vice versa. If for some reason the hard drive crashed, we could rebuild the source from anyone's copies of what they've got."</p>

        <p>The games firm set publish upcoming projects for both studios through subsidiary Focus Entertainment Publishing</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Pullup Entertainment has acquired minority stakes in two independent studios, Uppercut Games and Rundisc.</p>
<p>The games firm will acquire financial assets in Submerged developer Uppercut, and will co-own and publish its upcoming game through its subsidiary, Focus Entertainment Publishing.</p>
<p>This subsidiary published Rundisc's Chants of Sennaar last year, and its partnership with Focus Entertainment will continue into a new project.</p>
<p>Australia-based <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/key-xcom-devs-leave-to-form-new-studio">Uppercut Games was founded in 2011</a> by industry veterans Andrew James and Ed Orman.</p>
<p>The deal between Pullup and Uppercut was negotiated by Cam Rogers Legal, a video games and digital entertainment law firm in Australia.</p>
<p>"The team at CRL have been tireless in their efforts, and their guidance and support were instrumental in getting this deal across the line," said Uppercut games director Ed Orman.</p>

            <p>
Fortnite has launched a major new battle royale mode, Reload, which drew in more than a million players to the game over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Available in both regular and Zero Build variants, Reload is a smaller-scale battle royale option with 40 players organised into 10 squads, with respawns enabled if at least one team member is still alive. 
</p>
<p>
If that sounds familiar, it's because Reload is very much inspired by Call of Duty: Warzone's popular Resurgence mode, which offers very similar mechanics. Respawning isn't instant and requires a wait time which increases over the match - though aggressive play can reduce it, if your teammates take out other players or entire squads.

<p>
Reload wraps all of this in another very popular wrapper - that of Fortnite's original Chapter 1 game map that returned last year to enormous success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">gifting Fortnite its biggest player numbers <em>ever</em></a>. In Reload, the action takes place in a shrunken-down version of the original battle royale island, albeit with iconic locations such as Tilted Towers, Pleasant Park and Retail Row replicated faithfully. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite publicly shares its player numbers, with the numbers of people playing each mode viewable from the game's main screen. Over the weekend, a peak of 1.6 million people were playing Reload across its regular and Zero Build variants. At the time of writing, Reload is currently Fortnite's most popular mode, beating its original Battle Royale. 
</p>
<p>
Reload looks to be Fortnite's big addition for this summer, as Epic Games prepares to go on its twice-annual company break. But there's plenty already programmed in for the next few weeks, including the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-pirates-of-the-caribbean-crossover-launches-next-month">previously-leaked Pirates of the Caribbean crossover</a>.

Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it's just two guys in a lion suit. They aren't even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

The news comes from Youtuber BonfireVN via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/model-viewer-forensics-reveal-that-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-dancing-lion-boss-is-actually-two-little-guys-piloting-it-around/">PCGamer</a>, who has posted a video showing the model with the costume removed and, what's more, in combat, which inevitably makes the whole fight look rather funny. The front half of the lion might be the source of all those eye-catching AOE attacks but the back half of the lion is doing all the heavy lifting, to the point of defying the laws of physics. Feel free to point a finger and laugh uproariously like a school bully at a pantomime rehearsal. I'm sure it'll make you feel better when you take a lightning bolt to the chops for the 30th time running.

Generally speaking, I both love it and feel quite anxious when developers take the time to depict things which you'll technically never see: landscapes that can't be visited, proper skeletons for characters that, that kind of thing. I also wonder whether they could have gone a bit meta with this.
</p>
<p>
The Dancing Lion has its place in Erdtree's lore, as you'd expect, but perhaps they could have done an Icon Of Sin and put From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki inside it. He'd be the front half of the lion, naturally, but who would be the other half? Whomst at From Software has the clout, the talent, the sheer stage presence to be the back half of Elden Ring's dancing lion? In other news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">Shadow Of The Erdtree has launched to a mixed reception on Steam</a>, with a significant portion of the negative response owing to players finding it too difficult.

The DLC’s extreme — and intended - difficulty has sparked a debate about the rights and wrongs of developer FromSoftware’s approach with this <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> expansion. But now that debate has spilled over into Steam user reviews, which currently have a ‘mixed’ rating after a flood of complaints about the rock hard bosses as well as PC performance issues.</p><p>Ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree’s release, director Hidetaka Miyazaki signaled the DLC would significantly test players’ abilities. "The new challenges for the player are going to be the boss encounters as well as the different kinds of threats that the world will impose on people," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET</a>. Some of these bosses are aimed at players who've completed most of the base Elden Ring, meaning FromSoftware has "kind of really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player," he added.</p><p>And so it has proved. Over the weekend, players began to complain about the extreme difficulty with bosses and performance issues. “As a huge fan of all soulgames, I would love to like the DLC, but the enemies' damages are completely overtuned, especially for some bosses,'' reads one negative review. “Some have a completely erratic moveset rendering the whole experience just painful without any fun.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some have a completely erratic moveset rendering the whole experience just painful without any fun.</p></div><p>“Good DLC, but performance has gone down as of the latest update,” reads another negative review, this time focused on the PC performance problems. “Constant micro-stuttering and frame drops, freezes as well as increases in loading times make it difficult to enjoy and play the game. One of the early boss fights takes place around a puddle of water, which drops frames considerably. Wait for performance improvements before buying.”</p><p>Perhaps mindful of the growing negative feedback over difficulty, publisher Bandai Namco tweeted some advice for struggling Shadow of the Erdtree players: “This is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing.” This tallies with advice IGN itself has offered. Indeed we believe <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">Shadow of the Erdtree's Scadutree Blessings are the answer to the Elden Ring DLC's difficulty</a> (Scadutree Blessing bolsters the recipient's abilities to deal and negate damage). You can check our guide to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Scadutree_Fragment_Locations"><u>track down every last Scadutree Fragment</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing</p>— Bandai Namco US (@BandaiNamcoUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, the Shadow of the Erdtree review bombing continues, but it’s worth pointing out that at the time of this article’s publication, 65% of the DLC’s 32,722 user reviews are positive on Valve’s platform.</p><p>FromSoftware game difficulty has been a hot topic for years, with the likes of Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Bloodborne all called too hard by some. But extreme difficulty has not hindered their sales success. Indeed Elden Ring has sold an incredible 25 million copies, and is by a clear distance the biggest FromSoftware game ever.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, Miyazaki explained why FromSoftware looks to continuously push players, rather than offer easier difficulties that would theoretically open up its games to a wider audience.</p><p>"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more, but that wasn’t the right approach," Miyazaki said. "Had we taken that approach, I don’t think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy, which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."</p><p>An amusing upshot of the debate around Shadow of the Erdtree’s difficulty is a renewed nostalgia for the base game and its bosses, now said to be relatively easygoing in retrospect.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-2024-06-24-093218-1719217949985.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: reddit.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-2024-06-24-093255-1719217982603.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Shadow of the Erdtree has certainly enjoyed critical acclaim, and has become the highest-rated video game expansion of all-time by overtaking Witcher 3 DLC Blood and Wine on Metacritic. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Shadow of the Erdtree review</a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tips-for-navigating-the-pr-landscape.909465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tips-for-navigating-the-pr-landscape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The indie space is incredibly exciting, and increasingly competitive. Players can only pick so many games a year and with discoverability being one of the leading issues for developers (and players), there's a case to be made that PR is as vital as ever.</p>
<p>But how can you effectively utilise the PR resources you have at your disposal? What tactics should you employ to engage with your target audience? And how will you ensure the publications and influencers you engage with also benefit from these endeavours?</p>
<p>Speaking from experience, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to PR in the games industry. Conducting influencer outreach on AAA projects was a vastly different experience from working on an indie gem like The Case of the Golden Idol. Both require flexibility in the approach taken to PR and marketing.</p>
<p>What is certain is that there is now an even greater need to shift between different techniques and strategies when it comes to engaging with your audience. Journalists and influencers are more sensitive than ever before, acutely in tune with their audiences – their tastes, preferences, and expectations. As a result, good quality PR has never been more important to indie devs looking to make a success of their latest titles.</p>
<p>But what exactly are the key tips for indie developers looking to effectively utilise PR to successfully pitch and market their latest games?</p>
<h2><strong>The importance of building relationships and understanding your audience </strong></h2>
<p>PR is a relationship-based industry. While individuals in other fields, such as marketing, conduct outreach that can reach millions of viewers, PRs often deal in the thousands. Sustaining relationships with thousands of people, however, is a near-impossible task.</p>
<p>As a result, many studios will diminish the importance of building relationships with publications and influencers, and instead adopt a traditional 'spray and pray' approach.</p>
<p>In some instances, this is necessary, particularly when you are first starting your outreach and getting started in the field, but if you incorporate this frequently, this strategy is not only going to dent your hopes of building new relationships, but also putting those you do have in jeopardy.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to refine this approach. The first top PR tip for indie devs is to learn from these initial interactions with journalists, reviewers, and influencers, and build genuine relationships with them moving forward.</p>
<p>Decipher which of your contacts have engaged with your initial approach and tailor specific pitches to those you feel confident will resonate best with your content. It is even possible to build a relationship like this off the back of a negative initial response. Now you know what they're looking for and – crucially – what they would rather not hear about!</p>
<p>Once you have a refined list of contacts whose interests you understand, it's then time to tailor your pitches based on these interests. If you know a journalist hates first-person shooters, you don't want to pitch them your new first-person shooter...</p>
<blockquote>Identifying the right channels to pitch to, and tailoring these pitches accordingly, is a key part of utilising PR for any indie developer</blockquote>
<p>Traditional enthusiast publications will have a different approach to reviewing your game and will be broadcasting to a different audience than a YouTube influencer, for example. Screenshots of gameplay will get an online publication talking, but won't be much use to a Twitch streamer.</p>
<p>Balatro is a key example of the importance of tailoring your pitches to the right audience in order to maximise your chances of success. At no point during the pitching process did all the influencers on my target list receive a pitch for Balatro, but outreach to enthusiast sites and other online review platforms was strong.</p>
<p>The game garnered reviews of 9/10 and 10/10 and the response was overwhelmingly positive. By that point, the media had become the influencers, which then in turn garnered the interest of the individual influencers to pick up the game and do what they do best.</p>
<p>Identifying the right channels to pitch to, and tailoring these pitches accordingly, is a key part of utilising PR for any indie developer. Understanding this audience will allow you to reach your specific target audience and get the exposure your game deserves.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding the win-win</strong></h2>
<p>Tailoring your pitch is one thing, but it is also salient to consider how the other side will benefit. The media landscape is constantly changing, and whereas journalists and influencers may have had the time to focus on the latest indie gem in days gone by, the current media landscape – much like the games landscape itself – is increasingly competitive.</p>
<p>Having to meet KPIs and benchmarks means that they will typically only cover a game if they see value in it to them and their audience. For this reason, it's key for you to focus on a 'win-win' pitching strategy.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Wout-van-Halderen.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>An example we can point to is The Case of the Golden Idol, which we launched in 2022. This game received 9s and 10s in reviews, and the player response to the game was overwhelmingly positive. However, when working on the PR for this game, a serious consideration we had to look at was that it didn't stream particularly well.</p>
<p>It is a very cerebral experience, which doesn't necessarily lend itself to streaming on the likes of Twitch and YouTube. Pitching an influencer with the aim of producing a stream or video, while earning exposure for the game itself, could have a negative impact on that particular influencer's channel.</p>
<p>This meant it was important to consider the 'win-win'. In tailoring the pitch, we suggested to a certain influencer that they played the game first and then – if they enjoyed it – would be interested in covering it on their social media. The game reached that influencer's audience, receiving welcome exposure as a result, without negatively impacting the influencer's output. It was a 'win-win' for both parties.</p>
<p>There has been a shift in focus in recent times from a discoverability focus to prioritising these win-win partnerships. As PRs, we need to keep in mind that game enthusiast websites, review outlets, and individual influencers all run as businesses in their own right. If you tailor your pitches towards a 'win-win' outcome, you are more likely to secure opportunities for your game while also building relationships with those you have pitched to.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Case-of-the-Golden-Idol.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><strong>The champions</strong></h2>
<p>While there has been a shift in emphasis to a more win-win oriented approach, discoverability remains a leading topic of interest for a number of indie devs throughout the industry. In essence, the key to discoverability is not just PR, but good quality PR.</p>
<p>Take Balatro again as an example. Sending screenshots of the game and short clips of gameplay didn't do much for securing any interest; out of context those screenshots just looked like some cards on a poker table, doing little to convey what the content of the game itself is.</p>
<blockquote>In essence, the key to discoverability is not just PR, but good quality PR</blockquote>
<p>Simply put, inviting champions – which were identified in my research – to play the game for 20 minutes, knowing that they likely wouldn't put it down for hours. The game was the story, and it needed the right people to tell it.</p>
<p>Once you have the right champions for your game, remember that all discourse around the title will impact its visibility. Both positive and negative reviews can garner attention, and it's what you do with that attention that will ultimately determine the success of your PR strategy.</p>
<p>These media outlets can shape public opinion and start online conversations, which can determine the cultural significance of a particular game. Being able to get your title in front of the media allows you to be a central part of these conversations, improving the discoverability of your game.</p>
<h2><strong>The value of that first asset</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to indie devs looking to kickstart a PR campaign, you have to start somewhere. It's super important to have that amazing first asset; be it a trailer, screenshots or gameplay clips that will grab the attention of the audience you are looking to engage with.</p>
<p>Creating a kick-ass trailer was one of the key steps we took in the lead-up to the launch of Mortal Shell. This trailer – which was posted on IGN's website – encouraged influencers to stream the game, promoting it to a wider audience. This initial asset gave the game early momentum, allowing the PR strategy to take shape around it moving forward.</p>
<p>Some studios will not have this luxury at their disposal. It might be that these assets are taking time to create, or simply that the assets you already have are not necessarily going to resonate with the channels you are approaching.</p>
<blockquote>It is important to appreciate that a tepid response to these assets can, in some cases, be less productive than no engagement at all</blockquote>
<p>The key when it comes to utilising the creative assets is understanding its impact, and looking to be flexible if it doesn't have that desired outcome. If it looks as though your asset is going to generate some very strong, positive engagement, then look to build on this success as you progress with your strategy.</p>
<p>If your asset doesn't produce high levels of traffic, it is important to appreciate that a tepid response to these assets can, in some cases, be less productive than no engagement at all.</p>
<p>To conclude, the number one focus should be focussing on that 'win-win'. Lowering that barrier to coverage as much as possible is crucial to the success of any up-and-coming indie studio.</p>
<p>For example, if you are looking to send an influencer a demo for them to broadcast to their followers, but the demo in question has a one-hour tutorial to play through prior to the main event, the influencer is unlikely to see the benefits for their own channel.</p>
<p>Sharp, punchy, exciting assets that suit your chosen PR audience are far more likely to get you the engagement you desire. Above all else, remember the 'relations' part of PR. Be specific, know the content your chosen channel produces, and tailor that gem of a pitch accordingly.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12.15pm UK: </strong>Speaking to Eurogamer, GAME has categorically denied the report published earlier today which stated the chain would stop selling boxed games and consoles in its stores. 
</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Eurogamer, the brand said it would continue to sell a "wide range" of boxed games in store and online. We've followed up for more detail on whether any of these sales will still require a pre-order, as previously reported.
</p>
<p>"This reporting is categorically not true," a GAME spokesperson told Eurogamer today. "GAME continues to support the physical gaming market, offering a wide-range of physical games, hardware, software, accessories and digital gift cards, in stores and online."</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11.30am UK: </strong>
Beleagured high street chain GAME will no longer sell physical games, other than fulfilling pre-orders. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/news/game-ending-in-store-video-game-sales/">Gfinity</a> report which states that upcoming new launches will need to be pre-ordered before launch to be picked up in store. 
</p>
<p>
The same is true of video game consoles, the report goes on, suggesting that outside of hardware launches you will no longer be able to walk into a shop and buy a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S off the shelf.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted GAME for more detail.

The move would be the latest radical change to GAME's operation this year, following the end of both its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">long-running trade-in scheme</a> - meaning you can no longer buy or exchange pre-owned games - and the shutdown of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME Elite reward programme</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">Eurogamer reported how many GAME staff had been moved to zero-hour contracts, with others made redundant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the changes to GAME are part of a wider move to operate the brand largely within concession units for other stores owned by its parent company the Frasers Group - such as Sports Direct.
</p>
<p>
Much of GAME's floor space and sales are now taken up by toys and collectables such as Funko Pops. Still, a GAME where you can't even buy physical games is the chain's most surprising move yet.

            <p>
With the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring players are back to their old tricks by playing the game in weird and wonderful ways.
</p>
<p>
Take Twitch streamer Perrikaryal, who's already played the game with her mind and is now tackling Shadow of the Erdtree. Yes, you read that right.
</p>
<p>
Perrikaryal uses a bluetooth, portable EEG reader to analyse patterns of brain activity and, along with an eye-tracker, convert these to inputs. She then thinks about specific actions, which trigger rolls, attacks and the like in game - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/perrikaryal/clip/SpinelessFilthyPresidentShazBotstix-NCMKhK02R5dFDFsE">here's an explanation clip</a>.

<p>

This has allowed the streamer to complete Elden Ring without using a traditional controller. And now, with the DLC released last Friday, she's already beaten its second major boss. 
</p>
<div>

<p>
Another streamer is back on the base game, but every dodge roll in the game is performed with an actual roll in real life.
</p>
<p>
GoodGameEthan began this run five months ago, playing the game with a controller until the time comes to dodge and he barrel rolls across a mat. So far he's up to Maliketh, but aims to play the DLC this way too.
</p>
<p>
"I tried really hard to beat the game before the DLC but my knees gave out on me after two hours fighting Godfrey this morning," he said in a comment on reddit. "Will try to beat the game before I tackle the DLC."
</p>

Lastly, streamer itzCBD has completed the entire base game from NG to NG+7 without dying a single time and without levelling up at all.
</p>
<p>
That's eight full playthroughs of the game with the same Wretch class character remaining at level one.

It's a hugely impressive feat, and along with others shows just how accomplished Elden Ring players have become after beating the base game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-defeats-elden-rings-malenia-in-dance-pad-and-controller-simultaneous-challenge-run">dance pads</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">bananas</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Still, Shadow of the Erdtree bumps up the difficulty of the game, which - along with performance issues - has resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">Mixed response on Steam from unhappy players</a>.

			<p>The technical differences between PlayStation and Xbox consoles are so negligible nowadays that one standard home console would benefit games more than the current platform war between Sony and Microsoft, according to a former PlayStation head.</p>
<p>Speaking during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHf5avkORyc">a panel</a> held during IGN Live 2024 regarding where we will be playing games in the future, former PlayStation head Shawn Layden commented on the platform war between Sony and Microsoft, saying that if we got it out of the way and had one standard home console, games would be better. Nowadays, technical differences between PlayStation and Xbox are negligible, as both are using the same hardware from AMD.</p>
<p><em>"Xbox, PlayStation, high-end PC, that's almost at a plateau where all things being equal, they're pretty much the same. We'd be in a better world if we could get down to one standard home console technology that we could come together, and get this platform war thing out of the way."</em></p>
<p>The former PlayStation head also commented on the console market, which is currently struggling, but this, according to Layden, is nothing new. The global install base in any previous console generation never rose above 250 million, with the only exception being the Wii era, as some software, such as Wii Fit, appealed to an audience that doesn't usually play games. Those numbers were clearly not sustainable, and the install base went back to the 250 million overall of every other generation. The increased revenue during the pandemic, additionally, did not come from new people entering the console gaming world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Where Will You Be Playing Games in the Future? | IGN Live 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHf5avkORyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time in recent times we have heard that Sony and Xbox hardware is essentially the same. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-needed-advancing-visuals/">April</a>, well-known AMD leaker Kepler talked about how all hardware vendors have converged to very similar designs, and, as such, there's barely any difference between CPUs and GPUs from different vendors, and optimizing for one vendor essentially applies to all others. With Microsoft opening up to releasing some of its titles to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, one really has to wonder if the platform war will indeed go away at some point, although Nintendo is unlikely to retire from the hardware market anytime soon, considering how successful its systems continue to be.</p>

        <p>It has also launched a non-compliance investigation in response to Apple's business terms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The European Commission has found Apple in breach of its Digital Markets Act following <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eu-commission-investigates-google-meta-and-apple-for-possible-digital-markets-act-violations">an investigation launched in March</a> against the firm.</p>
<p>In its preliminary findings, the EU Commission said it found Apple's rules of engagement did not comply with the DMA because it "prevent[s] app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content."</p>
<p>The EU Commission found that Apple's business terms do not allow developers to freely communicate with consumers to promote alternative app stores, and that while the firm does allow steering by allowing developers to include links to web pages in their apps, they are met with several restrictions.</p>
<p>This includes Apple's "core technology fee" which sees developers pay €0.50 for every app install per year after the first install distributed via the App Store and alternative marketplaces.</p>
<p>The regulator has also launched a non-compliance investigation in response to Apple's business terms, including the core technology fee, eligibility requirements for developers, and the process to download alternative app stores on iPhones.</p>
<p>As a result, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-apple-facing-1bn-daily-fines-over-alleged-dma-breaches">Apple could face daily fines of up to 5% of the company's average turnover</a>, amounting to over $1 billion.</p>
<p>"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases," the regulator said.</p>

            <p>Pirates of the Caribbean is coming to Fortnite next month.</p>
<p>Last week's update to Fortnite included characters and content set to be part of the crossover, and initially an event pass featuring Captain Jack Sparrow was made available to buy. Dataminers quickly discovered other characters set to arrive as well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">solidifying rumours</a> that emerged several months back when Fortnite's 2024 roadmap first leaked. </p>
<p>Now, acknowledging the event pass' early sale, developer Epic Games has confirmed the crossover's official release: 19th July.</p>

<p>As you may recall, several of the leaked roadmap's upcoming events – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">such as Billie Eilish coming to the game in April</a> – have since turned out to be true, adding credence to reports that a Pirates of the Caribbean crossover was also on the way.</p>
<p>This time, notable Fortnite leaker Hypex took to social media platform X with a new image showing off Davy Jones, Hector Barbossa, and Elizabeth Swann, who look to be purchasable separately from the event pass.</p>
<p>There's also a new pirate-themed item, Ship in the Bottle – described as "a cursed ship trapped in a bottle. Open it to unleash the ship from its ghostly depths, diving into your opponents with a devastating crash!" – and a Jack Sparrow "Jar of Dirt" emote.</p> <div>

<p>Hypex says the Pirates of the Caribbean shop will open on 18th July, 2024, whilst fellow leaker ShiinaBR reckons the crossover event itself is scheduled to kick off the following day.</p>
<p>Hypex was one of the first to spot that The Pirates of the Caribbean pass had been placed for sale early, before Epic stepped in to ensure it was <a href="https://x.com/thedarkvortex13/status/1804517742768214028">swiftly removed</a>. Those who did manage to buy it say they <a href="https://x.com/ItzHarcos/status/1804411760285286532">"didn't get anything but the skin"</a> - for now.</p> <div>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Epic confirmed that anyone who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its 19th July release date would not be able to "progress the pass until the start of the event", and invited players to apply for refunds if they didn't want to wait.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>For players who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its intended release on July 19, please note you are currently unable to progress the Pass until the start of the event, but will retain your Jack Sparrow outfit in the meantime.</p><p>If you wish to instead refund this purchase… <a href="https://t.co/i3FdtuNSLW">pic.twitter.com/i3FdtuNSLW</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1804535483571007684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert">Did you see Metallica's Fortnite concert over the weekend</a>?  Not only did the metal band headline the game's next Fortnite Festival season, but all four of Metallica's members are now unlockable as skins in the mode's next Festival Pass.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recent Fortnite update notably adds a new competitive way to play Festival: Battle Stage. As Tom explained for us at the time, here 16 players face off against each other via a song chosen at random, with your Overdrive operating as an attack power to take other players down a peg. Or, you can team up with a four-person party of friends and pick specific tunes to fight over.</p>

            <p>Despite an overwhelmingly strong reception with critics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> is currently sitting at a ‘mixed’ review rating on Steam, with nay-sayers citing performance issues and overbearing enemy design. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-3-tips">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-review">Blood And Wine</a>’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.</p>

<p>On the technical side, recent negative reviews highlight stutters, drops, and low frame rates. As for gameplay, there’s a thread of players hitting breaking point with boss and enemy design, both in terms of difficulty scaling and boss attack patterns. To elucidate, although not dismiss, these complaints: Shadow Of The Erdtree implements a new progression system where players are required to explore and collect Scadutree Fragments in order to be on par with much of the DLC’s content outside the base area. As such, the damage that Erdtree’s enemies both dish out and take is scaled differently from the base game. The DLC has only been out a few days, so its possible players are attempting to best the high level content without being fully prepared.</p>
<p>As for boss design itself, players repeatedly mention lengthy attack combos, unreadable boss tells, and encounters that otherwise seem to prioritise difficulty over enjoyment. These same criticisms were levelled against some of the bosses in the base game, and it seems the arms-race design of the DLC has, for some, exacerbated these issues.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I’ve got mixed feelings on the mixed reviews. I’m sympathetic towards anyone who felt alienated by Elden Ring’s critical reception, homogeneous and aggressively superlative as it was. It feels like, in distilling both what was good and bad about the base game, FromSoft have pushed a section of the playerbase to voice their issues with the DLC. That said, and strangely enough, I’m actually finding most of Erdtree’s bosses to be far fairer and more thoughtfully designed than the more difficult encounters found in the original release. It feels as if FromSoft have returned to the boss design of old somewhat. However, I am wearing extremely heavy armour, and I’ve also scoured the map for Scadutree fragments, so I'm basically a tank at this point. I’ve seen clips of people getting one shot by bosses, which must be extremely frustrating. </p>
<p>I think pushback on universally well-reviewed games - providing it's presented respectfully - is a good thing. No-one wants a critical monoculture. Players should absolutely voice the criticisms they have, but I do find myself asking if they'd be any less disappointed if they’d beaten the thing in a weekend? If we can say anything about FromSoft's games, it's that their resistance to instant mastery or comprehension makes them monumentally unsuitable for the culture of accelerated, reactive discourse in which we find ourselves. Friction, I suppose, was inevitable, and I do hope these players eventually find the joy in the game they've bought, even if it's just in the bizarrely serene ghost worms.</p>

            <p>Happy Monday all! Yes, I wrote that with total sincerity. We all deserve a happy Monday - perhaps video games can help with that. As you'd expect, Elden Ring's recently released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC remains this week's Big Kahuna, with no obvious mega releases in the offing to break its chokehold on the discourse, but I have dipped my latex-gloved hand into the gestation pools and fished out a few promising oddities.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 24th June kicks off with bone-throwing dungeon solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/">Dice &amp; Fold</a>. On Tuesday 25th June, we've got the remake of mystical 90s point-and-clicker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">Riven</a> - now with real-time 3D environments, shock - together with magic realist high school visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/">Until Then</a> and Argentinian folk horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2761100/Pomberito/"> Pomberito</a>, in which a farmer must survive five nights while investigating a local beastie. Skipping forward to Thursday 27th June, there's some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807170/Stray_Gods_Orpheus/">Orpheus DLC for RPG musical Stray Gods</a>, and the early access launch of 30 player last-person-stand 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287920/BATTLE_CRUSH/">Battle Crush</a>. On Friday 28th June, there's the early access release of tornado-chasing simulation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a>, which has you monitoring rogue weather on a 625 square kilometre map. </p>
<p>Here at the RPS Treehouse we'll be spending a fair bit of the week feeding the Maw freshly-hewn pieces of Erdtree, but we'll also be running our mitts over a co-op anime shooter I won't spoil, dredging up long-forgotten Aliens games, and possibly finding time for a stylised retro FPS or two. The Maw would typically consider this spartan fare, but there's so much molten Elden Ring DLC running through its cyclopean veins I think we'll get away with it. Even the Maw needs time to digest.</p>

    UK retail chain GAME have denied a report that suggested they were planning to stop selling physical games, whatever they are, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/game-reportedly-set-to-stop-selling-physical-games-aside-from-pre-orders">via VG247</a>. Admittedly, I too occasionally feel the spectral pangs of this widespread Mandela Effect, whenever I read a shampoo bottle on the toilet and suffer vivid hallucinations of something called an 'instruction manual'.

    Maw enthusiasts may have noticed that this week's liveblog article is differently styled, with what I hope is a slightly more engaging and transparent headline. The Maw is in a state of evolution - a terrifying time. As such, we especially welcome any thoughts you have about its future in the comments.

    I played a bit of knightly platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/662340/Renaine/">Renaine</a>'s demo over the weekend and enjoyed it. While Shovel Knight is the obvious comparison, I also get a very faint Mystery Dungeon vibe from it.

			<p>Sony may be working to bring proper PlayStation 3 backward compatibility to PlayStation 5, although only for select titles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@XboxEra"> XboxEra podcast</a>, Shpeshal Nick revealed that he's heard that Sony is working on bringing backward compatibility for select PlayStation 3 titles on the current-generation consoles. The compatible titles will apparently also be sold individually, similarly to what Microsoft did with Xbox backward compatibility. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if the PS3 games compatible with PlayStation 5 will receive performance or visual improvements. It's also unknown which games would be selected to be playable on PlayStation 5, although Nick speculates it could be mostly first-party titles, which would make sense.</p>
<p><iframe title="The XboxEra Podcast | LIVE | Episode 217 - &quot;It Lives!”" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwVRYZGPWEA?start=10683&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Proper PlayStation 3 backward compatibility for PlayStation 5 would be huge, as right now, PlayStation 3 titles are only playable on the console via cloud streaming, which doesn't always deliver the best possible experience. The fact that titles would be available for purchase individually would be big as well, allowing users to enjoy them without requiring the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-plus-to-launch-this-june-premium-subscription-to-give-access-to-classic-ps3-ps2-ps1-and-psp-games/">PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</a> that is now needed to access PS3 games via cloud streaming. As it always is with rumors, however, we must take everything with a grain of salt until Sony makes an official announcement.</p>
