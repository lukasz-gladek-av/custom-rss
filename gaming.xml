<p>Threading the needle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You've read the title, you've seen photos of the booths online, so you know it's coming — six years after its last official public demo, we've <em>finally</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. And, we've played it on Switch 2, too.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's special broadcast tomorrow, 21st August, we — or, more specifically, the lovely Felix — has spent some hands-on time with the highly-anticipated sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it's only about 15-minutes or so, but that's 15 minutes more than we had before. So, was it worth the two-hour-long wait? (Yes, <em>two</em> hours)</p>
<p>Of the two demos available — one from near the beginning of the game in a green area, and another later in the game in a magma-filled stage — Felix picked the second one. And, as we've already confirmed, there's a 120fps mode.</p>
<p>There's more dialogue (given that Hornet speaks), more collectible, and different movement options. And, of course, Felix took on the demo's big boss, Lace. So, it's more Hollow Knight with more features, at least for now.</p>
<p><em>So, if you want your first look at Silksong on Switch 2, here's the place for it — check out Felix's video up-top and then let us know if you're looking forward to Silksong in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-officially-launches-this-october.1275603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 20/08/2025:</strong> Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter) spotted that Best Buy has already listed the prices for the ROG Xbox Ally and the Xbox Ally X, confirming the prices leaked by Billbil-kun below. Pre-orders are not yet live, but should be any moment, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/">Billbil-kun already reported that they would go live today.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Xbox has announced the official release date for the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X at Gamescom 2025, which will officially launch this coming October 16, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced during Xbox's first day of livestreaming during this year's Gamescom, but it's not news for anyone that's been paying attention to the ROG Xbox Ally, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">Billbil-kun from Dealabs leaked the release date last week</a>.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun even leaked the prices, though Xbox has yet to confirm them at the time of this writing. Earlier today,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social/post/3lwt47zevds24"> in a Bluesky post</a>, they claimed the US prices would be <strong>$549.99 </strong>for the ROG Xbox Ally and <strong>$899.99</strong> for the ROG Xbox Ally X. Billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">leaked the European prices last month</a>.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Inside the ROG Xbox Ally: Game Access and Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTaboYwSyuc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Gamescom live stream also went over a few details for the Ally, like the fact that it will come with Microsoft's Co-Pilot for Gaming built in, and that games will carry a performance tag similar to what Valve has for the Steam Deck. Instead of something being 'Ally verified' or not, games will carry one of three tags telling players what kind of performance they can expect.</p>



<p>If the game in question has been tested and can hit at least 30FPS on the ROG Xbox Ally, it'll get a "<em>Should perform well on this device</em>" tag. If it has been tested and can hit at least 60FPS, it'll have a "<em>Should perform great on this device</em>" tag. If it's not been tested, it'll have a "<em>Performance check not available yet</em>" tag.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Handheld Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQiwumMYsGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding that testing, Xbox also introduced its Handheld Compatibility Program, which is "<em>a new Xbox initiative designed to make more games ready to play on your supported handheld</em>,"<em> </em>according to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/">Xbox Wire post</a>. Xbox has been working with studios to test "<em>thousands of games for handheld compatibility,"</em> to ensure they're ready for players picking up an Ally this coming October.</p>



<p>It's nice to see the release date get an official confirmation, even if the news was spoiled before Xbox got the chance to shout it out itself. Hopefully, we'll have the prices confirmed soon. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-news-and-announcements.1275597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year's Gamescom Opening Night Live aired just last night, and it came packed with a ton of reveals and new information about existing games. Here's everything that was announced during the show, including the pre-show stream!</p>

<hr>

<p>We'll begin with everything that was revealed during the pre-show segment, which ran for a little under half an hour. Believe it or not, it was packed with news as well. Here we go!</p>

<h3><em>Bubsy 4D</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bubsy-4d-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=WK7OwcgS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bubsy-4d-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=K8gPjW2i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>is back, baby.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a brand new 3D platformer from Atari and Fabraz, namely&nbsp;<em>Bubsy 4D</em>. That's right; everyone's (least?) favorite feline mischief-maker is still around, and his latest game is coming to PC and consoles sometime in the near future.</p>

<h3><em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em></h3>

<p>The next game on Gamescom's 2025 agenda was&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em>, a roguelite strategy game in which you must "take command of a fleet escaping the annihilation of the Twelve Colonies". Early 2026 for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Outlaws</em></h3>

<p>Nightdive continues its mission to single-handedly revive all of retro gaming with a remaster of the 1997 Western-themed FPS&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. You can expect to check this one out on November 20th.</p>

<h3><em>Denshattack!</em></h3>




<p>I'm not sure how to describe&nbsp;<em>Denshattack!</em>. Train platformer? On-rails skating racer?&nbsp;<em>Yellow Train Goes Choo-Choo</em>?&nbsp;Well, at any rate, it's coming in 2026, and it looks like exactly the kind of off-the-wall insanity the indie industry excels at.</p>

<h3><em>Keeper</em></h3>

<p>Next on the agenda was an interview with&nbsp;<em>Keeper&nbsp;</em>creative director Lee Petty, who told us a little more about the way Double Fine's upcoming lighthouse sim (?) will work. As a reminder, the game is due to launch on October 17th.</p>

<h3><em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</em></h3>

<p>Try saying that name ten times fast.&nbsp;<em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction&nbsp;</em>is a classic-style pixel-art beat-'em-up featuring iconic characters like He-Man, She-Ra, and Man-at-Arms, and it's coming soon.</p>

<h3><em>Absolum</em></h3>

<p>We got a look at another beat-'em-up next in the form of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>, which launches on October 9th. If you want to know more about this one, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and" rel="nofollow">preview of it right here</a>.</p>

<h3><em>Long Gone</em></h3>

<p>Hey, have you had enough of zombies yet? <i>Long Gone&nbsp;</i>sure hopes you haven't. It's a narrative survival adventure inspired by "games of old", according to developer Hillfort Games, and it launches soon.</p>

<h3><em>Valor Mortis</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valor-mortis-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=RKOayitY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valor-mortis-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=2FrLM7Xh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wouldn't want to run into him on a dark&nbsp;<em>rue</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The developers behind&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner&nbsp;</em>are trying their hands at a Soulslike, it turns out, and that Soulslike is&nbsp;<em>Valor Mortis</em>. It's a rather distinctive-looking first-person action game set to debut next year, so keep an eye out for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</em></h3>

<p>It's okay; you can just call this one&nbsp;<em>PVKK&nbsp;</em>if you want. It's a sim that sees you operating a planetary defense cannon amidst an interplanetary invasion, and you'll have to press all the right buttons if you want to fend said invasion off.</p>

<h3><em>Routine</em></h3>

<p>Yeah, that's right,&nbsp;<em>Routine&nbsp;</em>is still alive! Remember this one from back in the day? The narrative-based horror game is still very much alive (although there's no guarantee you'll stay that way during your playthrough), and it's coming in late 2025.</p>

<h3><em>Swords of Legends</em></h3>

<p>Okay, okay, I know this one's from an established franchise, but come on.&nbsp;<em>Swords of Legends</em>? They may as well have called it&nbsp;<em>Quest of Hero</em>. In any case, it's a single-player action Soulslike set to arrive...uhh, sometime in the future.</p>

<h3><em>Road Kings</em></h3>

<p>From Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment comes&nbsp;<em>Road Kings</em>, a "next-gen truck simulation" that has you hauling cargo across the American South while dealing with natural disasters along the way. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h3><em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>are getting crossover DLC packs</h3>

<p>Next, we got to see DLC packs for both&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, both of which are getting DLC themed around the other game.&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man</em>'s comes in late 2025, while&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>'s arrives early next year.</p>

<hr><h2>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 - Main Show Announcements</h2>

<p>Well, that's everything from the pre-show, so now we're getting into the meat of things. Here's everything we got to see during the main Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 ceremony!</p>

<h3><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h3>

<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week" rel="nofollow">big announcement for&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>tomorrow</a> (which is almost certainly going to be a release date), we got to see some new gameplay footage, and hey, it certainly looks like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. Hype is building yet again for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></h3>

<p>Next up, it's a look at the characteristically bonkers-looking&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, and a giant man smashing his fist into one of the game's campaign stages is just one of the weird sights you're going to see when the shooter launches on November 14th.</p>

<h3><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></h3>




<p>CI Games announced its Soulslike followup&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>next (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" rel="nofollow">well, officially, anyway</a>), and it's got more of the pseudo-Biblical designs and ruined kingdoms that the first game loved so much. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h3><em>Sekiro: No Defeat</em></h3>

<p>No, it's not a followup to 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-sales" rel="nofollow">hugely popular</a>&nbsp;<em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, but an anime adaptation of the game with some pretty gnarly-looking art. It's coming exclusively to Crunchyroll next year.</p>

<h3><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h3>

<p>You're in luck if you love Batman and Lego, because this new game will marry the two once again. It's a sort of anthology experience that takes in many of the Dark Knight's most iconic movie, TV, and comic appearances, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h3><em>Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War IV</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-iv-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=SsQ15cXt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-iv-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=7nhSeNXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dawn of War IV&nbsp;</em>brings the franchise back to its roots, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The iconic RTS franchise returns, although it's not being helmed by its usual custodian Relic Entertainment this time around, instead being developed by&nbsp;<em>Iron Harvest&nbsp;</em>studio King Art. Happily, though, it looks exactly like&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>should. 2026 for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</i>cross over</h3>

<p><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed over with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>before, and they're about to do so again when&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>'s iconic Omega monster finds its way into <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>in late September.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>is also getting itself a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>encounter in October.</p>

<h3><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em></h3>

<p>Next, Capcom showed off its upcoming hack-and-slash revival&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and hey, it sure looks like an&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>game, complete with lots of fancy swordwork and creepy-looking enemies. No release date beyond 2026 for this one yet.</p>

<h3><em>Arknights: Endfield</em></h3>

<p>We got to see a moody trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Arknights&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Arknights: Endfield&nbsp;</em>next, and it'll marry action RPG gameplay with, uh, base-building and factory simulation. This one doesn't yet have a release window.</p>

<h3><em>Europa Universalis V</em></h3>

<p>If you're one of the players who was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-vii-slow-start-take-two" rel="nofollow">disappointed</a> by&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>, then perhaps Paradox's (admittedly more complex)&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" rel="nofollow">Europa Universalis V</a>&nbsp;</em>will work better for you. We got to see it in action during Gamescom ONL, and it's coming on November 4th.</p>

<h3><em>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</em></h3>

<p>I didn't have a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Daemon x Machina&nbsp;</em>on my 2025 bingo card back when it was announced in 2023, but here we are. We got to see a new trailer for it during yesterday's ceremony, too. It's set for launch on September 5th.</p>

<h3><em>Void/Breaker</em></h3>

<p>Playstack and Stubby Games' futuristic roguelite shooter&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker&nbsp;</em>is next, and hey, wouldn't you know it, the game is out right now. You can check it out right this instant if you think you'd be interested!</p>

<h3><em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season 2</h3>




<p>Prime Video's second season of its acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show got itself an airing following&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em>, and we got to see some clips of the show, which will be heading to New Vegas <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">when it begins airing</a> on December 17th.</p>

<h3><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2</h3>

<p>A trailer for&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>confirmed that the game will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime next year, which is a pretty impressive feat of porting prowess. No specific release date for this yet, though.</p>

<h3><em>Deadpool VR</em></h3>

<p>Yep,&nbsp;<em>Deadpool VR&nbsp;</em>is still a thing, and we got to see a new trailer for it during Gamescom Opening Night Live last night. It looks exactly as irreverent and silly as you'd expect a&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>game to look, so bonus points for that, I guess.</p>

<h3><em>World of Tanks 2.0</em></h3>

<p>The "biggest update" in&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks</em>' history is scheduled to launch in early September, and it'll bring an entirely new tier of vehicles, a brand new map, and plenty more. If you're a&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks&nbsp;</em>devotee, you won't want to miss this.</p>

<h3><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></h3>

<p>Saber Interactive's co-op FPS is shaping up to be the perfect tribute to the 80s oeuvre of its titular filmmaker, and a new trailer last night further confirmed that the game is going to be full of over-the-top insanity when it arrives next year.</p>

<h3><em>Death Scrolling</em></h3>

<p>Now here's something you don't see every day: an auto-scroller that scrolls upwards, not sideways.&nbsp;<em>Death Scrolling&nbsp;</em>comes to us from legendary publisher MicroProse and equally legendary developer Ron Gilbert, and it has plenty of fantasy-inflected action for you.</p>

<h3><em>Zero Parades</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zero-parades-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=vdQ41vm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zero-parades-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=-a6TkDmi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM has a lot to prove with&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>ZA/UM's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">new RPG</a> is called&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades</em>, and it's a "story-rich espionage RPG" in which you must "untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History". Here's hoping ZA/UM, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">what's left of it</a>, can pull this one off.</p>

<h3><em>Neverness to Everness</em></h3>

<p>A new trailer for Hotta's&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>showed us that yes, the game definitely does look like a big ol' melange of everything HoYoverse is currently running, and no, we still don't have a release date.</p>

<h3><em>Unbeatable</em></h3>

<p>In this rhythm-action game, "music is illegal and you do crimes", according to D-Cell Games and publisher Playstack. I've got a bit of a bee in my bonnet about "rock'n'roll can save the world" stories, but I guess we'll see if this one can change my mind on November 6th.</p>

<h3><em>Honor of Kings: World</em></h3>

<p><em>Honor of Kings: World&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honor-of-kings-world-cross-platform-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">still exists</a>, and we got to see more of its, erm, world during a trailer last night. It all looks very grandiose and fantastical, although we still don't have any idea when we can actually play this one.</p>

<h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3>

<p>We're just a few weeks away from&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>now, and just in case the story was the part of this frenetic hack-and-slash game in which you're most interested, that's what last night's trailer focused on. More slashing, please!</p>

<h3><em>Cinder City</em></h3>




<p>Turns out NCSoft's Project LLL is actually&nbsp;<em>Cinder City</em>, an MMO shooter that takes place in an alternate-future version of Seoul devastated by a mysterious crisis. This one looks suitably ambitious, combining squad-based tactics, vehicles, and more.</p>

<h3><em>Time Takers</em></h3>

<p>Time (ahem) to see another live-service shooter now in the form of&nbsp;<em>Time Takers</em>, a team-based game in which "time is your lifeline - and every second is earned, spent, or lost in combat". It's another NCSoft game, and a playtest is coming to Steam soon.</p>

<h3><em>Silent Hill f</em></h3>

<p>We got another look at upcoming survival horror&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>next, and though it looks a bit more action-oriented than I'm used to from this franchise, it seems as though Konami has its mojo back. We'll find out in late September.</p>

<h3><em>La Divina Commedia</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/la-divina-commedia-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=6O4PKbXu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/la-divina-commedia-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=2cYJvMEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous attempts at adapting&nbsp;<em>The Divine Comedy&nbsp;</em>haven't exactly been roaring successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps this attempt at adapting Dante Alighieri's famous&nbsp;<em>The Divine Comedy&nbsp;</em>into an action game will be more successful than EA's famously mid effort, although its "procedural extraction dungeon generation" system doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.</p>

<h3><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></h3>

<p>Yup, Bloober Team's upcoming survival horror game sure looks like a horror game alright. I'm on record as a Bloober hater, but perhaps, between this and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the studio can redeem itself in my eyes. I'm sure they're itching to do just that.</p>

<h3><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></h3>

<p>Obsidian's RPG has some pretty big shoes to fill, not to mention an entire first game to apologize for (sorry, I'm on record as a hater for that as well). Let's hope the studio has learned its lesson and can deliver a satisfying RPG experience this time around!</p>

<h3><em>inZoi: Island Getaway</em></h3>

<p>Next, we got to see a DLC pack for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">AI-filled</a>&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-like&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Island Getaway&nbsp;</em>bringing tons of idyllic new scenery and other features. It's out today, so if you love&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, you can already check it out!</p>

<h3><em>Fate Trigger</em></h3>

<p>Yup, that's right: it's another anime-style live-service shooter.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger&nbsp;</em>launches in the first quarter of 2026, and I can only speak for myself, but its art style makes it a little difficult for me to get particularly hyped for this one.</p>

<h3><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em></h3>

<p>We got to see this anime action RPG in, well, action next, and there's a closed beta test on the cards as well, so if you want to get a chance to try out Netmarble's game, you can do just that.</p>

<h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3>

<p>Next, we learned that Digital Sun and 11 bit studios'&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in Early Access on October 23rd</a>, bringing more action-RPG-slash-shop-management shenanigans with it.</p>

<h3><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gamescom-opening-night-live.jpg?itok=xGJQwcRB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gamescom-opening-night-live.jpg?itok=BBUMHq1E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could all the roadblocks finally have been removed?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>finally, finally, finally has a release date, and I really, really hope The Chinese Room and Paradox don't delay it again (unless it's absolutely necessary for quality, of course). October 21st for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Enshrouded</em></h3>

<p>Update 7 is coming soon for&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, and "Wake of the Water", as it's known, will bring lots of sunken treasures for you to plunder. The update is in the works now, although we don't know when it's landing just yet.</p>

<h3><em>Age of Empires IV</em></h3>

<p>The latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires&nbsp;</em>series of real-time strategy games is coming to the PlayStation 5, together with its&nbsp;<em>Dynasties of the East&nbsp;</em>DLC. The game launches for Sony's machine on November 4th.</p>

<h3><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></h3>

<p>Devolver Digital's beloved roguelite action-slash-management game (the composer of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cult-of-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies" rel="nofollow">we sadly lost last year</a>) is getting a "massive paid expansion" in the form of&nbsp;<em>Woolhaven&nbsp;</em>next year, bringing new weapons and much more for you to intimidate your followers with.</p>

<h3><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></h3>




<p>Next up, we got a new cinematic trailer for the&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em>, which forms the next part of Chris Metzen's Worldsoul Saga, as well as some gameplay. It's coming next year, so make sure you're leveled accordingly.</p>

<h3><em>Project Spectrum</em></h3>

<p>You might not be able to tell it from the creepy and evocative trailer, but&nbsp;<em>Project Spectrum&nbsp;</em>is actually a multiplayer game; it's kind of like&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, by the sound of things. No release date for this one yet.</p>

<h3><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></h3>

<p>Hey, look at that.&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is getting its own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/co-op-is-coming-to-ghosts-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Tsushima</em>-style multiplayer DLC</a> next year, bringing a "fantastical, supernatural setting" to contrast against the core game's historically-accurate locations. Cool stuff!</p>

<h3><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h3>

<p>If you were hoping for some actual, y'know, gameplay from&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, you'd have left yesterday night's show disappointed, but perhaps more will be on the way soon. At any rate, we did get to see a fun and spooky snippet of new gameplay, so that's something, at least.</p>

<h3><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em></h3>




<p>Lastly, we got to learn that Game Science is working on a brand new followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">which I rather liked</a>.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui&nbsp;</em>will follow the titular Chinese folk hero and is currently in development.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that's everything! I hope you've enjoyed this recap of all things Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-asus%E2%80%99-new-xbox-ally-handhelds-launch-on-october-16th.1275594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Asus are putting a date on their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">new Xbox Ally handhelds</a>: October 16th. Both the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X will be available on the same day in a variety of markets worldwide, but Microsoft and Asus aren’t opening preorders yet or revealing pricing. Microsoft also announced its handheld compatibility program to identify games optimized for the new Xbox Ally devices.</p><p>Leaks have suggested that the Xbox Ally will debut at €599 (around $699) and the top-of-the-line Xbox Ally X model at €899 ($1,049). I understand Microsoft and Asus had planned to announce Xbox Ally pricing and release date information today, but then it decided to only reveal a release date. Microsoft is now promising pricing and preorder information “in the coming weeks.”</p><p>The price information delay could be related to the leaks or ongoing uncertainty with US tariffs. <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340"><em>Dealabs </em>reported</a> yesterday that the Xbox Ally could be priced at $549.99 and the Xbox Ally X at $899.99 in the US. It will be interesting to see if Microsoft and Asus can subsidize this further for this important Xbox hardware release.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The homescreen of the Xbox Ally X.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Both Xbox Ally handhelds will be available on October 16th in the following: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, China (only the Xbox Ally X), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam.</p><p>That covers a lot of key markets for Asus and Xbox at launch, and there are also plans to introduce these handhelds in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 1080p gaming. Like the existing ROG Ally and Ally X, the new ones share the same 7-inch 1080p screen, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and VRR support.</p><p>The Xbox Ally uses AMD’s Ryzen Z2 A chip, combined with 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and 512GB of M.2 2280 SSD storage. The Xbox Ally X upgrades the chip to AMD’s Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD.</p><p>Alongside release date confirmation, Microsoft also announced its handheld compatibility program today. “We have worked with game studios to test, optimize, and verify thousands of games for handheld compatibility, allowing you to jump into the game without having to tweak settings, or requiring only minor adjustments,” says Roanne Sones, CVP of gaming devices and ecosystem at Xbox.</p><p>There will be two forms of handheld compatibility: Handheld Optimized and Mostly Compatible. While Handheld Optimized games will have default controller inputs, accurate icons, and the correct screen resolution in full-screen mode, Mostly Compatible titles “may require minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The task switcher on the Xbox Ally X lets you switch into the Windows desktop.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Microsoft will also mark games with a Windows Performance Fit indicator, so you’ll get the benefit of knowing if a game is compatible and how well it will play. Both Xbox Ally devices will ship with the Xbox full screen experience that Microsoft has been developing to improve Windows on handheld devices. This will boot as default, with the Windows desktop hidden away but still accessible through an option in the Xbox Game Bar UI.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on improving the game shader experience on Windows, with a new “advanced shader delivery” feature. This will preload game shaders during download on the Xbox Ally devices, so certain games can launch a lot faster and run smoother without the typical stutters that shader compilation introduces on Windows. This is key on a handheld as it will help with battery life and performance, but it’s not clear which games will support this just yet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166413/microsoft-windows-auto-super-resolution-sr-qualcomm-npu-dlss-fsr">Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</a>, which is an NPU to upscale games, is also arriving in early 2026 on the Xbox Ally X. Microsoft is planning to use the NPU on this device to introduce a highlight reels feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay moments and make them easily shareable with friends or on social networks.</p><p>Additional improvements to the docking experience for the Xbox Ally devices are also coming soon. Microsoft is working “to enable a seamless, high-performance setup that supports big-screen gaming, Auto SR, intuitive controller pairing, optimized display output, and more,” according to Soanes.</p><p><em>Photos by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> may have slowed down earlier this year so that developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">focus on his next game</a>, Haunted Chocolatier, but that doesn't mean it's going into hibernation. In fact it's even going so far as to jump worlds through an upcoming collaboration with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/infinity-nikki/">Infinity Nikki</a>, of all games, as revealed in a new trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer kicks off with a group of Junimos, those cute, apple-looking creatures that help you tend to your chores on the farm, before revealing a strawberry-looking asteroid that had crash-landed. After inspecting it, the asteroid explodes, shooting off one of the Juminos into Infinity Nikki's world, turning it 3D as it does so. As cute as the trailer might be, it's also quite light on details.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Infinity Nikki × Stardew Valley Collab Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There's no word on what the collaboration will look like in-game, but at the very least a date for the collab has been set: September 1. That's the same date Infinity Nikki receives its next big update, version 1.9, aka the "Music Season." The full scope of version 1.9 is yet to be revealed, though it is set to introduce a <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/241" rel="nofollow ">new Home feature</a> where you'll get your own house on a secluded island that you get to decorate yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Nikki faced a bit of controversy this year after an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/infinity-nikki-team-offers-apologies-and-compensation-after-unpopular-update/1100-6531661/">unpopular update</a>, particularly because of what some claimed were quite aggressive monetization practices. On the opposite end of player responses, Stardew Valley actually became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-a-new-best-rated-game-of-all-time/1100-6533053/">best-rated game of all time on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> has been through a hell of a journey to reach us. At <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">last night’s Opening Night Live from Gamescom</a>, Paradox revealed the long-delayed game finally has a release date, October 21. What the publisher didn’t boast about was is that it is locking two out of the six playable clans behind paid day-one DLC, and it’ll cost you an extra $30 to unlock them. A third of the ways to play the game.</p> <p>Expensive day-one DLC was once the most loathed concept in gaming. Back in 2012 <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-dlc-triggers-fan-outrage-bioware-respons-5887626">it was the talk of the industry</a>, as companies deliberately developed a chunk of the launched game with the intention of hiding it behind a further paywall, and people understandably <em>hated it</em>. Times moved on, and now we’re screwed over in all manner of different ways, most usually seeing significant portions of games sectioned off behind so-called “battle passes,” where we’re expected to not just pay once but to buy new ones multiple times throughout the year! Yay video games! But Paradox is kicking us old-school with <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>by deciding that a full third of how you can play the game will require you to fork out 50 percent of the original asking price again. The cheapest version of the game will cost you $60 on PC, but if you want to buy everything they developed for launch, it’ll cost you an extraordinary $90. Not even the $70 “Deluxe Edition” will secure you either of the missing clans. (Thanks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc"><em>RPS</em></a>.)</p> <p>A huge part of how the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines</em> played was based on the clan you chose at the start. It affected not just more common features like stats, but entirely changed how you approached the game. Different clans within the world treated you accordingly, missions were experienced differently as a result, and the means by which you could approach the RPG quests were all affected by who you were. Play as Brujah and you were a mighty warrior but very vulnerable to “frenzy,” where you’d fully lose control of your bloodlust. But pick a Toreador and you were a schmoozer, expert in socializing, but weakened by your inability to turn away from the truly beautiful. Clearly these made for very different experiences of the game. But now, in&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, if you want to be a Toreador and play that way, it’s going to cost you an awful lot more.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/bloodlines-faq">the game’s own FAQ</a> makes clear, these choices are not cosmetic.</p> <p>“How will the dialogue options differ in each playthrough?” asks one of the questions. The answer:</p> <blockquote> <p>The dialogue options differ depending on which clan you’ve chosen and what choices you’ve made throughout the story. When hunting for Blood Resonance, specific disciplines and outfit choices can also affect NPCs on the street.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also notes that “each clan offers new, unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits.” Play style seems a hell of a thing to lock to day-one DLC.</p> <p>For a while, Bloodlines<em> 2</em> did look to have become vaporware, after its original development under Hardsuit Labs fell apart in 2021 following its former leads being fired. Then in 2023 it re-emerged, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">now being developed by The Chinese Room</a>, the studio best known for their walking sims, which has had its own turbulent few years. Given The Chinese Room only released their most recent game, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, in June of last year, it seemed unlikely that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> could be imminent. But here we are! It’s out in just a couple of months.</p> <p>We’ve reached out to Paradox to ask what has motivated the decision to lock away such a significant chunk of the core game behind day-one DLC. (Although we can guess it’s at least in part, “We desperately need to recoup some of the costs of the last six years of development across two different studios under multiple different leaderships for the sequel to a game that came out in 2004.”) We’ll report back if they respond.</p>

<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally has an official release date. </p>



<p>After weeks and months of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ally-x-release-date-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and leaks</a>, it was officially confirmed on Wednesday that the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally will launch on October 16. The announcement came during the official Xbox Gamescom stream.</p>



<p>What fans might be surprised to find out, however, was that only a release date was announced. What wasn’t confirmed was the price of the devices, at least at the time of publishing. Even in the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1958159636370174153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post on social media</a>, pricing wasn’t mentioned. </p>



<p>There are rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-and-asus-delay-xbox-ally-price-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circulating on the floor in Cologne</a> regarding the price after it was leaked yet again that it will cost $549.99 for the Xbox Ally and $899.99 for the Xbox Ally X. However, it’s pure speculation at this time.</p>



<p>When official pricing information is announced, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft announcing the release date of the Xbox Ally but not the pricing? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

Availability will expand to additional regions where the ROG Ally series is already sold today. Pricing and pre-order details will follow in the coming weeks.</p><p>ROG and Xbox co-developed the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X to give gamers the freedom to play their way, anytime and anywhere. The ROG Xbox Ally is powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor featuring four Zen 2 cores with eight threads and eight RDNA 2 GPU cores. This offers ultra-efficient performance, paired with 16GB of LPDDR5X‑6400 RAM and a 512GB M.2 SSD, and all backed by a 60Wh battery for extended play.</p><p>The premium, high-performance ROG Xbox Ally X ups the ante with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, a new 8‑core/16‑thread Zen 5 APU with 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores and an integrated 50 TOPS NPU. The ROG Xbox Ally X also features 24GB of LPDDR5X‑8000 memory, a 1TB M.2 SSD, and boasts a larger 80Wh battery for longer playtime.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Optimized for Handheld</strong></p><p>The team at Xbox has been hard at work behind the scenes partnering with game studios to test and optimize thousands of <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> titles for handheld compatibility. This new Handheld Compatibility Program ensures day-one users have the best experience possible on their ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. At launch, compatible games in the game library will sport Handheld Optimized or Mostly Compatible badges.</p><p>Handheld Optimized means that the game is ready to go—with default controller inputs, an intuitive text input method, accurate iconography, clear text legibility, and appropriate resolution in full-screen mode. Mostly Compatible means that the game may require minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld.</p><p>The Xbox team is also bringing advanced shader delivery to the ROG Xbox Ally. This allows the Xbox app to preload a game’s shaders during download, so supported games will launch up to 10x faster, run more smoothly, and use less battery on first play. Xbox is working on adding this feature to even more games over time.</p><p>The ROG Xbox Ally X also features AMD’s cutting-edge Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor with a built-in NPU, that unlocks upcoming AI powered features starting early next year—with more to come. These features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</strong> – a system-level feature that uses the power of the NPU to upscale games running at lower resolutions. This delivers high-resolution visuals and smooth framerates across a wide range of games, with no additional changes required from game developers.</li><li><strong>Highlight Reels</strong> – AI captures standout gameplay moments—like epic boss battles or victories—and generates short replay clips to share with friends or on social channels.</li></ul><p><strong>See the New ROG Ally Lineup in <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a></strong></p><p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will make their fully playable debut at Gamescom 2025, joined by ROG’s complete 2025 laptop lineup powered by the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.

How does Leslie feel about the competition? He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-lazy-accusations-and-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he recently played the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> open beta and concluded that "it's a fun game," but Activision is staying focused on its own product.</p><p>"We're fans of all games and I think we look for inspiration anywhere. But we're focused on our own craft. They're doing their thing," he said. "We know if we can hit our goals, we're going to deliver what the fans want and that's the key, because if we're happy when we're play testing, then we know fans are going to be happy play testing."</p><p>Leslie added: "We're fans of the FPS genre. We're fans of lots of games. Let's all have fun."</p><p>The developer was also asked to respond to the claims from some in the FPS community that Call of Duty doesn't do enough to innovate with its annual releases. Leslie said, "You just don't worry about it." He said the developers instead aim to stick to their vision and make something fun for people to enjoy.</p><p>"There's always going to be people that are going to try to knock you down and not have positive criticism, which we do look for. So, it's like noise. You try to cut through that and stick to your vision and plan," he said.</p><p>Former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently said</a> that Battlefield 6 will "boot stomp" Black Ops 7. "The real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it," he said.</p><p>For what it's worth, experts do not expect Battlefield 6 to outsell Black Ops 7, in part because the masses of casual players who play Call of Duty <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will buy the newest game every year even if they complain about a lack of major changes or innovation.</a> As for Ybarra's comments specifically, one research firm said <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he needs to "chill out" and think more critically.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, which is about a month after Battlefield 6 arrives on October 10. </p>

                <p>For the first time ever, Activision is releasing new Call of Duty: Black Ops games in consecutive years. Beyond that, the same two developers that led the production of Black Ops 6--Treyarch and Raven Software--are once again co-leading the development on<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073"> Black Ops 7</a>.</p><p>With Activision previously stating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-three-year-dev-cycle-ensures-best-id/1100-6421741/" data-ref-id="1100-6421741">how important it is to have a three-year production cycle for each new Call of Duty game</a>, many are wondering how it's even possible that Black Ops 7 is coming just a year after Black Ops 6.

<p>"They were started at the same time," Leslie sad. "So obviously they have different production ramp-up times, but they were started in parallel and greenlit at the same time. That was a really unique challenge, but also fun to be able to know that you're going to do that. Black Ops 6 is going to be 1991 rogue team, and now how do you flip the script on Black Ops 7 in 2035?"</p><p>Also worth noting is that while Treyarch and Raven are the two co-lead developers for Black Ops 7, Activision's network of studios are contributing to its development. For example, Beenox is heading up the PC edition specifically. Other studios that worked on Black Ops 7 include Activision Shanghai, Demonware, Digital Legends, High Moon Studios, Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Activision Central Design, Activision Central Technology, and Activision QA.</p><p>Lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski, meanwhile, said making the games in tandem affords for some "payoffs" that might not have been possible in a different setup. "A lot of the things that we innovated on with Black Ops 6, you're going to see in Black Ops 7, and so it's a great connector," Pohorski said.</p><p>One of those features is the Omnimovement system, which is expanding in Black Ops 7 with things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-see-wall-running-and-active-camo-in-action-plus-other-major-multiplayer-changes/1100-6534097/" data-ref-id="1100-6534097">wall-running</a>. Additionally, Black Ops 7 adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-adds-a-new-20v20-mode-with-wingsuits-and-grappling-hooks/1100-6534075/" data-ref-id="1100-6534075">wingsuits and grappling hooks.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, and it'll also be available at launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s Jet</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Once upon a time, Jet-Ski games were all the rage. Arcade cabinets and fifth generation consoles were replete with these high-speed polygonal racers that sent you careening around tracks set in sunny locales with bobbing water physics. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_aqua_jet">Aqua Jet</a> was an early example of the trend and released the very same year as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/wave_race_64">Wave Race 64</a>. Now, you can play it in all its glory on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hamster Corporation has recently released two other classic Namco arcade titles on the new console in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Air Combat</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> is just as lovingly curated as those games. In lieu of riding a replica personal watercraft, like the original cabinet offered, there's some nice feedback from the HD rumble and togglable gyroscopic controls. Elsewhere, there are widescreen format options and the ability to play both English and Japanese versions of the ROM.</p>
<p>There is such a wealth of customisation and ways to tailor your experience here that it's a shame the actual game doesn't warrant much of your time. Only two courses are available and unlocked from the start, with the advanced course being simply an extension of the normal course.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version features High Score and Time Attack modes, which offer some replay value, while a Caravan mode gives players a continuous five-minute block to set the best scores. You can also rewind if you're not happy with a turn.</p>
<p>The tracks still look great, with bright colours popping in both docked and undocked modes and an impressive sense of speed. Big jumps send you plunging underwater to catch a brief glimpse of the fauna, while whales and helicopters dart about at the periphery of the course.</p>
<p>Mirror variants and a goofy penguin mode can be unlocked with cheats detailed in the menus, but that’s still only two more versions of the same track. So unless you're a hardcore aquatic racing fan, or a big fan of the arcade original, this might not be the right game for you.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet offers one other nice feature in online leaderboards to keep you cracking away at course times, but with no multiplayer, there's barely any reason to revisit this once you're satisfied with your performance.</p>
<p>Still, Hamster has done another solid job bringing a '90s arcade classic to Switch 2 and making it sing. Unfortunately, without much content present in the base game, there are only so many times you can revisit this colourful racer before things get repetitive.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.

			<p>Where Winds Meet, the free-to-play open-world action-adventure RPG from Everstone Studio and NetEase will launch in the Western world on PS5 and PC this coming November 14, 2025, Everstone and NetEase have announced.</p>



<p>The game initially launched on PC in China in December 2024, followed by an iOS and Android launch this past January. It's been a long time coming to PS5, as lead designer Chris Lyu explains in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/where-winds-meet-launches-november-14/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that the November date will be the culmination of five years worth of work at Everstone Studio.</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve crafted this game with care, pouring our hearts into every detail over the past five years, and we’re beyond excited to share it with the world," </em>Lyu writes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The final PC and PS5 test for Where Winds Meet was <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/">held last month</a> ahead of this November launch, and around that time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got the chance to speak to Everstone Studio</a> and, more specifically, today's PS Blog author, Chris Lyu, about the coming title. </p>



<p>At the time, Lyu told Wccftech, "<em>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles."</em></p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that resonates with players when it arrives on PC and PS5 on November 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>2025 is very much shaping up to be the year for the return of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401">Mega-Evolved Pokémon</a>. While GameFreak is being frustratingly tight-lipped about which mega pocket monsters will be appearing in this October’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682/15#content">we do already know that Mega Dragonite</a> will be making its weird-ass mutant debut in the game. At the same time, September will see the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> start a new era of cards, returning to the enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-mega-evolution-leak-lucario-latias-1851786474">Mega Pokémon designs</a> and presumably some new beasts there too. But can you cuddle any of those? No ma’am, you cannot. So thank goodness for <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/new-releases">the Pokémon Center’s new range of plushies</a>.</p> <p>Eight new plushies have been added to the store, featuring both fan-favorites and a couple of more obscure choices. The most important thing is, yes, there’s Mega Gengar and Mega Gardevoir. But personally, I’m most excited to see Mega Mawile, because it’s so spectacularly bonkers.</p> <p>Each new plush costs a pretty steep $40, and are roughly about 11 to 13 inches tall or wide (obviously they vary, given the shape of the Pokémon, so Mega Lucario stands almost 16″ tall, but is narrow). And based on what amounts to an embarrassing degree of personal experience (I’ve lost count of how many Pokémon plushies I’ve bought, but it certainly falls under “too many”), Pokémon Center cuddly toys tend to be made to extraordinarily high standards. They really seem to be exquisitely well made, although you’d hope so given the premium prices. And yeah, stop judging me, but I’m absolutely buying the Mega Mawile.</p> <p>I’ve put images of each of the eight Megas in the following gallery, to see if you can be tempted too. And think fast—I don’t imagine Mega Gengar will stay in stock for long.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new video showcasing the Resident Evil Requiem gameplay has surfaced online, featuring Grace Ashcroft. </p>



<p>Yesterday, players finally got a new look at Resident Evil Requiem’s gameplay at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gets-gameplay-trailer-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>; however, there was barely any action to be seen. Players have been waiting for some proper gameplay action since the first preview, and it has finally arrived online. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-showcases-grace-being-chased-by-a-monster">Resident Evil Requiem Gameplay Showcases Grace Being Chased by a Monster</h2>



<p>The new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay comes from a new X post (formerly Twitter) from <a href="https://x.com/famitsu/status/1958122126684434578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958132494718669014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a>). The video starts with Grace being confronted and chased by a massive female monster. Grace is shown running and stumbling through different rooms and hallways as she searches for a way to hide from the frightening creature. Interestingly, the creature has the ability to suddenly appear in front of the player or even break through doors, keeping them on their toes at all times. Check out the full video below. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="『バイオハザード レクイエム』先行プレイ。ひたすら追ってくる謎のクリーチャーが怖すぎる！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZrxMd-n57k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the latest Resident Evil Requiem gameplay, Grace seems to be in a panic mode, holding only a lighter to find her way through the dark and eerie hallways. The monster can also bite her if she gets too close to it. Later on, she is seen entering a well-lit room; however, the monster can’t follow her inside as the light seems to be reacting with its skin. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-details-about-the-stalker-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> from earlier today informed us that the stalker monster is not well-suited to bright light, and it appears that entering well-lit areas is the only way to escape it. </p>



<p>Towards the end of the Resident Evil Requiem gameplay video, we see Grace enter a completely different room, where she climbs a table to get her hands on a toolbox. The toolbox includes a screwdriver, which is something the character was seemingly looking for. Moreover, the room is in complete disarray, with blood splattered all across the floor and walls, and some lockers turned upside down. </p>



<p>An earlier <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> had stated that this woman monster is none other than Alyssa Ashcroft, Grace’s mother. Additionally, the next Resident Evil Remakes are reportedly going to be Code Veronica and Zero, and they are expected to arrive in&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ww1-gallipoli-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ww1-gallipoli-hands-on-preview-a-fantastic-next-installment-in-the-world-war-1-game-series.1275495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first hands-on opportunities to play BlackMill Games’ next World War 1 multiplayer shooter, WW1 Gallipoli.</p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I was thrilled when I first heard that BlackMill Games was releasing a new WW1 game in its series, which already includes Verdun, Tannenberg, and Isonzo. At the time of writing, I have a good few hundred hours of playtime across all of those titles, and with WW1 Gallipoli set to release sometime in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, those hours of playtime will undoubtedly grow next year. Even more so now that I’ve had the chance to play the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-middle-eastern-combat">Middle Eastern Combat</h2>



<p>As the game’s name suggests, WW1 Gallipoli will focus on the Gallipoli campaign that was fought in Ottoman Turkey between April 1915 and January 1916. It marks the first time in the series that desert combat is featured in a fully-fledged fashion, with BlackMill Games once again continuing to maintain the accuracy it’s known for in its WW1 Game Series with authentic maps, weapons, uniforms, music, and more.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WW1: Gallipoli – Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yp0WfD85DzU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>During my limited time with the game, which, for full disclosure, was a pre-alpha build that the developers described as “very early in development”. However, apart from the usual bugs and glitches that you’d come to expect from a game in pre-alpha, I’m pleased to say that if you’re a fan of the series, you won’t be disappointed.</p>



<h2 id="h-squad-based-combat">Squad-Based Combat</h2>



<p>WW1 Gallipoli continues to build on the foundations laid by the series’ predecessors, all while maintaining accessibility for new players. Some of the bigger changes to the game are its class and squad system, which now sees additional roles added, including ‘Stretcher Bearer’, essentially a medic class, and an ammo class, the name of which I’ve forgotten. The developers tell me that this is to ensure more variety and give classes one specific weapon type. For example, in Isonzo, the Assault class had access to bolt-action rifles and submachine guns, whereas this time they don’t.</p>



<p>Another interesting change is a complete overhaul to the squad system, which now sees five squads of five players battle it out. Each Squad has a different assigned name and restrictions; for example, one squad might not have access to a sniper role, but have two stretcher-bearer roles, and another squad may focus on passive-combat. Another addition was a new downing system, which, if a non-lethal shot hits a player, will see them go ‘down’ rather than instant death. But whether or not players will actually revive others remains to be seen (I had a terrible experience in the recent Battlefield 6, please revive team mates!) </p>



<p>Overall, I think the changes to the squad and class system felt like a logical improvement – and while again, it was a pre-alpha build against bots, I can see the changes working out well. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-initial-thoughts">Final Initial Thoughts</h2>



<p>Although my time was limited and didn’t allow for the whole multiplayer experience the game offers (playing against bots can be fairly dull at times), BlackMill Games is clearly cooking up another classic with WW1 Gallipoli.</p>



<p>I’ll have more in-depth thoughts when I return from Gamescom with further details, but yeah, perhaps writing my initial thoughts surrounded by sweaty gamers isn’t ideal… But I needed to get <em><strong>SOMETHING</strong></em> up.</p>



<p>WW1 Gallipoli launches on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC in 2026.</p>



<p>Are you excited to play WW1 Gallipoli? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Available as a day-one release through Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft reported that it was the biggest third-party launch of all time on Game Pass back then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/high-on-life-is-biggest-xbox-game-pass-launch-of-2022-microsoft-confirms/1100-6510179/">and the biggest single-player game launch on Game Pass in its history</a>. The third-party record stood firm until 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-set-a-new-record-in-january-thanks-to-palworld/1100-6522027/">when Palworld took it from High on Life</a>. High on Life 2 will be a day-one Game Pass release for PC and Xbox Series X|S, and it'll also launch for PS5.</p>

<p>It's unclear if Roiland is involved in the development of High on Life 2, as he left Squanch Games in 2023 after a former employee sued the studio over accusations of sexual harassment and wrongful termination. The case was eventually settled after Roiland's exit. Recently, it was announced that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-success-story-high-on-life-getting-a-tv-show-with-one-of-its-hilarious-voice-actors/1100-6525587/">High on Life animated series</a> is in development.</p><p>One of the big changes in the sequel (<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/" rel="nofollow ">via Xbox Wire</a>) is that players can move around levels with a skateboard instead of a standard sprint option. This new component offers more than just a speedy way to move about, as players will be able to perform tricks and turn levels into skateparks, or use the board as a makeshift weapon in fights.</p><p>February is typically a big month for new game releases, and as the new year draws closer, we're seeing more titles announced for that month. February 2026 isn't too busy--for now--but High on Life 2 will be competing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/" data-ref-id="1100-6534107">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next chapter in Capcom's popular survival-horror series.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6900ba2000636/nintendo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gamescom 2025 is officially underway, and a handful of team NL are out on the show floor, gobbling up as many of the games as we can get our hands on.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Nintendo booth has captured much of our attention, with a particularly stacked line-up including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, all playable on Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's quite the sight, and we've been snapping up pics left, right and centre so you can get a taste of the Big N's presence on the show floor. So, here's a gallery of some of the Nintendo sights we've seen so far, starting with a handful of big ol' game banners and backdrops:</p>



<p>All looks good, but aren't those booths a little... secluded? For those keen to play in front of a crowd, it seems that Nintendo has you covered, too. This large area looks primed and ready for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> tournaments, though nothing was happening when we initially walked through. Looks intense though, right?</p>

<p>Naturally, there's some My Nintendo Store representation on the show floor too, with a handful of displays showcasing some of the finest Nintendo merch out there. Do you think we could get away with filing that Master Sword under 'checked baggage'?</p>

<p>There are plenty of other games <em>outside</em> the Nintendo booth that will be making their way to Switch and Switch 2, of course. Here's a handful of snaps from the ones we've spotted so far:</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/edf0ef7489215/nintendo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>There will be much, <em>much</em> more to see over the coming days, and you should keep an eye out on our Nintendo Life site and YouTube channel for our hands-on thoughts soon enough. But gosh, isn't it nice to see Nintendo at an in-person event again?</p>
