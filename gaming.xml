            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During yesterday's Game Awards, Capcom announced a sequel to cult classic 2006 action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, and it boasts the involvement of one of the original game's most important figures.</p>

<p>In a brief trailer shown during the Game Awards, Capcom confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Okami 2</em>, which is currently known simply as "<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>Sequel", is officially in the works, and that original director Hideki Kamiya will return to direct the project.</p>

<p>The game's <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/o-kami_newproject/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official website</a> sheds a little more light on the project too, although it doesn't give much away. According to the site,&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is being developed by "studios that include various staff members of the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>", including M-Two, Machine Head Works, and Kamiya's own Clovers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=MzvqDwD6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=aDf7wS6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is officially coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Capcom says it "will be some time" before we get more information about Amaterasu's latest adventure, but that the studio "really hope[s] you look forward to this project". I can only speak for myself, but I'm absolutely hyped for this.</p>

<p>The trailer itself is fairly brief as well. It features Amaterasu herself sprinting across a field while&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>'s distinctive music plays, and she's trailing beautiful flowers behind her, just like in the original game.</p>

<p>We then see a flower with closed petals as a paintbrush traces a thick ink circle around the flower, upon which it suddenly bursts into bloom. It's a reference to a paint gesture in the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, in case you haven't played it.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>here. I don't know about you, but just seeing this minute or so of footage made me weirdly emotional.</p>




<p><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't all Capcom revealed during the Game Awards, either.</p>

<p>As well as a revival of one classic PS2 franchise, we're also getting another in the form of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, a hack-and-slash action game that looks like it owes more than a small debt to FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>.</p>

<p>Reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense given that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">animated series based on the games</a>&nbsp;debuted late last year. You can check the trailer out for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>We'll bring you more on both&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, as well as everything else Capcom is up to right now, as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>No, your ears were not deceiving you. That was definitely Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle popping up at the end of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer last night</a>, and yes, the white-haired monster hunter will absolutely feature in some way in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While many had assumed as much -  let's be honest, it is hard to miss the gravely tones of Cockle's Geralt - developer CD Projekt has now officially confirmed what we all thought.</p>

<p>"Geralt will appear in the game," the Witcher 4 team told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms">IGN</a>. However, it refrained from giving much more away. "We don't want to spoil his role precisely," CD Projekt closed. "You'll have to wait to learn more for now."</p><p>Cockle actually let slip <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Geralt was going to have some part in the upcoming Witcher game</a>, which will instead star Ciri in the lead role, back in August. However, the actor had since tried to backtrack on these comments a tad, admitting he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">"got slapped" by CD Projekt for what he said</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything'," Cockle shared during a recent interview at MCM Comic Con Birmingham.</p>
<p>He went on to state: "The truth is I can't answer the question because I've signed an NDA. So even if I did know, I'd have to lie to you."</p>

		<p>The classic dinosaur hunter is back with Turok: Origins announced during The Game Awards. Saber Interactive is taking the classic IP and mixing it up with the three-player co-op, bringing it to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turok Origins - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cs4PW9oOPlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Turok: Origins will be a “fast-paced, third-person, sci-fi shooter, featuring both solo and cooperative action for up to three players,” which sure as heck sounds a lot like Saber’s template that they used for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/26/world-war-z-review-wwz-ps4-xbox-pc/">World War Z</a> and this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>.</p>
<p>The snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer suggest that they won’t be featuring their massive horde tech on this occasion, instead focussing more on small numbers of dinosaurs, using your weapons and abilities to down them before absorbing their DNA to upgrade your arsenal.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there will be a wide array of weapons, including plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns and more.</p>

<p>“Turok was one of the first console shooters I ever played,” said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. “When we looked at game franchises that we felt deserved to be brought back, Turok was at the top of our list. At Saber, we love taking classic IP and combining it with fresh gameplay. We are excited to finally announce the game, but we’ll be even happier when we deliver this old-school experience with modern-day execution.”</p>
<p>Turok first made his way into video games with the the trilogy of N64 games – Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. There was also the multiplayer focused Turok: Rage Wars. Since then, however, the franchise basically vanished into nothing, failing to land a hit in the early 2000s with a PS2 era Turok: Evolution or PS3 era Turok reboot. It’s really the N64 games that live on in the memory of gamers, thanks in no small part to Nightdive Studios who released that original trio of games in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/06/turok-and-turok-2-remasters-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">2015, 2017</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/24/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remastered-has-been-announced/">2023</a>, respectively.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/farmagia-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><span data-contrast="none">Have you ever been playing Pikmin and actually wanted to farm the adorable little plants complete with tilling land and ensuring they get enough water? &nbsp;Well, do I have a game for you. Farmagia (pronounced Far-mag-ia instead of Far-mage-ia in the biggest missed opportunity of the year) does exactly this combination of things, allowing you to cultivate your own personal army of part-plant, part-animal creatures to fight for you against other, equally adorable critters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Farmagia – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMlVgNeNp9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Set in the world of Felicidad, Farmagia follows one of the titular mages, Ten, as he and his friends grapple with being part of a rebellion to overthrow Glaza, the Magus. This deeply villainous character leads the Oración Seis, a set of regional lords that govern each continent of the world who you will get to know in your travels whether you want to or not. The story follows a typical structure as you travel the continents in your attempts to aid the rebellion, meeting new friends and foes alike and dispatching the majority of the latter. I kept wanting the story to take a turn, break out of the predictable path it was on, and be a little more exciting, but it never truly got there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">The gameplay is split into two sections, with farming and exploring dungeons being your two main activities. Beginning with the farming mechanics, this is one of the more engaging parts of the game as you plant the different Buddies that can be cultivated. Each one takes a specific amount of in-game time, and you must water them each in-game day as they grow on your farm. You can buy and craft items to help with this, such as increasing the yield from your crop or reducing the amount of time needed for it to grow, then leave the land to do its work as you go off to the dungeons. All activities on the farm cost FP (Farming Points) and you restore all your FP by resting overnight.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Where it gets a little deeper is in the difference between the types of Buddies you can cultivate. Battle Buddies, as the name suggests, will come into battle with you (more on this in a moment), but the Research Buddies are far more interesting. Planting Research Buddies will contribute toward your overall research in not only that creature, but also gain you points to use in the research tree. This then unlocks better farming equipment, larger farming space, new types of craftable items and even more powerful Battle Buddies. The problem being that all of this swiftly descends into busy work. Depending on your tolerance for that, the farming can quickly become monotonous and stale.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">In the dungeons, the combat is initially very enjoyable, giving the player up to four types of Battle Buddies to use in combat, each of which is attributed to a different face button. Pressing their corresponding button sends them out to attack your current target, building up their gauge to perform a powerful attack called a Unite Blitz. Each enemy you come across will be weak to a particular Battle Buddy, which will increase your damage and also work on breaking their guard. If you do attack enough to break their guard, it will stun them giving you a moment’s reprieve and a great opportunity to do some damage or a Buddy-specific super attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On top of this, you can combine all of your Battle Buddies to shield from attacks, with bonuses awarded for guarding just as an attack hits you, such as boosts to your various gauges. If an enemy is attempting to strike with an unblockable attack, which the game highlights with a red flash, you can even use your Unite Blitz&nbsp;just before it hits to perform a Unite Counter. Your Buddies can be killed though, so using these defensive abilities is integral to survival, as is running over to the little tykes if they’re stunned by an enemy. As a final trowel to your toolkit, you can also&nbsp;combine all of your creatures into one colossal creature with a Fusion to perform a devastating attack that behaves like a Final Fantasy summon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can shake up the gameplay in a variety of ways, the biggest of which is by changing your loadout of Buddies, of which you can even fine-tune how many of each you will bring into battle with you. You can also change your leader, which grants different skills that can be used in battle such as making it easier to inflict debuffs. Finally, each dungeon allows you to choose your way through to some extent and whether you wish to prioritise items, party buffs, or enemy encounters, so you really need to go out of your way to have two runs of a dungeon that are completely identical.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">This sounds very involved, and it is for a time, in the early parts of the game as you gain new types of Buddy and enhance the types you have already. Sadly, most aspects of the gameplay mentioned previously quickly become dull or don’t add much diversity to the game. For example, the dungeons themselves, although technically randomised, aren’t quite randomised enough, leaving each one feeling exactly like the last with maybe a new aesthetic identity to represent a new area i.e. a jungle or a swamp. That’s made worse by them each consistently ending in a remarkably similar-looking open area for their end-of-stage boss encounter.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Speaking of which, even the aesthetics of Farmagia don’t claw it out of the doldrums for me. I’ll concede that the various creatures are adorable, and I will never quite get over seeing the little wolves be pulled from what look like stalks of corn, but the characters play into a particular design philosophy that doesn’t gel with me. In other words, if you like your male characters to look generic as all sin, but your female characters having so much care in their design that they look like they’re from a different game entirely by comparison – you won’t have the same problem as I do here. But I’ll be the first to admit I’m just not a big-breasted anime girl kind of person.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the TGA 2024 pre-show, French developer Tactical Adventures announced Solasta II, sequel to the solid 2021 cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solasta: Crown of the Magister</a>. Like its predecessor, it is based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, although set in its own world.</p>
<p>The sequel takes place decades after the events witnessed in Crown of the Magister and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/palace-of-ice-dlc-for-solasta-crown-of-the-magister-launches-on-may-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palace of Ice DLC</a>. This time, a new band of adventurers will set out on the continent of Neokos, which has been conquered by a powerful, corrupting villain called Shadwyn. Her character will be voiced by Amelia Tyler, the award-winning actress behind Baldur's Gate III's narrator and Hades II's Hecate.</p>
<p>This is an inkling of the 'level up' that Tactical Adventures is planning for Solasta II, which will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 to deliver much more advanced visuals than the first entry, as you can see in the debut trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solasta II - Official Announcement Trailer [TGA 2024]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruN-X04RxFA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the gameplay front, Solasta II will once again allow players to take control of a group of four characters, which will be fully voiced this time, not to mention customizable when it comes to skills and abilities. The online co-op mode feature will be added during the Early Access phase.</p>
<p>Throughout the story campaign, players must navigate the various factions, get to know the inhabitants of Neokos, and most importantly, make wise decisions. Their choices will determine whether they are favored or despised.</p>
<p>Mathieu Girard, the game's Creative Director, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team of 35 combines deep expertise with a passion for crafting immersive and challenging gaming experiences. With our first game, we started as a Kickstarter success story, building on the SRD 5.1 ruleset to create a tactical RPG that has resonated with over 1.5 million players. Now, with Solasta II, we’re taking all that even further – pushing the system with fresh takes on tactical depth, fun and accessibility. Players will explore Neokos, a new continent brimming with magic, colossal landscapes and discover unprecedented lore, while facing the growing force of Shadwyn, a charismatic villain driven by a relentless desire to reclaim her lost power. This project is powered by ambition, respect for our players and a shared belief in the strength of what we’re building together. We can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on it and tell us what they think!</em></p>
<p>Solasta II will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> sometime next year, although a free demo will be shared in early 2025, providing fans with a juicy taste of what's to come. Later today, Tactical Adventures will host a developer live stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a>. It will go live at 9 AM PST / 12 PM EST / 6 PM CET, if you'd like to follow it.</p>

            <p>Will the bulletting of my beloved dinosaurs never cease? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turok-origins">Turok: Origins</a> will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it'll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.</p>

<p>There'll be a lot of melee attacking by the looks of things, but a shootybang is a shootybang. Players are promised "plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more" , while the DNA powers will supplement that combat (one power looks like a time-freezing bubble). There's also a story to follow, somewhere, but we're not told what it's about yet. Only that it is "epic" and will see the warriors visit lots of fancy locations "from ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles".</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the series has been revived. A reboot simply titled Turok came out in 2008 to mixed reviews. It sold well enough for developers at Propaganda Games to start work on a sequel, but not well enough to prevent its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-throws-turok-sequel-in-the-bin">being cancelled the following year</a>, resulting in 70 redundancies at the studio. How times change, eh? We'd never see ruthless layoffs like that today!</p><p>Anyway. It's being made by Saber Interactive, the many-studio'd publishers who specialise in working on licensed properties, and a relatively safe pair of hands. They did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>, among others. Saber are also working on another dinosaur game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>, which looks less violent toward the beautiful creatures and therefore morally more forgivable.</p>
<p>If I am cranky about the jungly shooter, please forgive me. It was shown off at The Game Awards, which aired in the early hours of this morning and has claimed all my Rock Paper Brethren, leaving only two survivors: me and guides guru Jeremy. The team was up posting much of the news, and before Ollie expired from a chronic case of video games, he wrote up a huge summary post of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">all the games revealed at the Game Awards 2024</a>. That's massively handy, that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and at the same time a trailer dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-character-will-be-revealed-this-week-and-clues-point-to-a-certain-lady-in-red">a big unmistakable hint</a> for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night's Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>? Sure. Why not.</p>

<p>Ah yes, lots of swooshy fire and ice effects alongside those jabs and slices, as befits the magic man. This is the second <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> character to guest star in the fighter in recent times, as Noctis from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a> also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noct-out-with-a-fish-my-quest-to-k-o-someone-in-tekken-with-a-tuna">found his fishy way into the Iron Fist Tournament</a> back in 2018. Some of Clive's warpy movement is reminiscent of the road tripping prince (one air-blipping combo in particular) but most of the moveset looks to be his own angry bashing. At one point he slashes Zantetsuken-style in the manner of Odin, long-standing summon of the RPG series, and for the finale he conjures Ifrit into being for what looks to be the character's Rage art. </p>
<p>He's the fourth and final character for anyone who bought the season 1 DLC pass, standing alongside the already-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-first-dlc-character-will-be-series-regular-eddy-gordo-kicking-off-its-season-pass-this-spring">Eddy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wapN3UqjJmI">Lidia</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heihachi-rises-from-the-dead-as-tekken-8s-third-character-dlc">Heihachi</a>. His fiery Phoenix Gate stage also comes included. There will be some disappointment, I'm sure, given how some fans have been clamouring for years to see Tifa - another Final Fantasy character - included as a guest (or Kiryu from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza">Yakuza</a> series). Once again they haven't seen their prayers answered, but perhaps the sting will fade when they inspect Clive's moveset. Some of his attacks look frighteningly fast. He's getting added to the game next week, December 16th.</p><p>As for my earlier reporting that the new character would likely be the bifferess in red, well, I got confused. Those hints were intended for the <em>next</em> season of the fighting game, suggesting that Anna is coming next year (Anna has been a mainstay in all Tekken games, apart from Tekken 4 for some reason). It serves me right for getting caught up in the prevailing winds of streamer opinion and the YouTube commentariat, instead of trusting my newsboi gut and simply saying in a boring voice: "we don't know who this will be yet." To be honest, I'm just upset we haven't yet seen any sign of drunken master Lei or irritable matador Miguel. Although, now that I look at Clive's hair, there is something distinctly Miguelish about him. Maybe I can dress him up?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new union consists of web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists, with an announcement on Bluesky identifying union members as "a majority of video game workers at ZeniMax Online Studios and the workers behind ESO."</p><p>"We are thrilled to be joining thousands of other tech and video game workers in building solidarity across the industry with CODE-CWA," the new union said in an announcement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhqijg226" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, tagging the CWA's campaign for unionization within the tech, gaming, and digital industries. "With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace, including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits--in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about."</p><p>In June this year, Microsoft signed a labor-neutrality agreement with the CWA, agreeing not to interfere with any unionization efforts within ZeniMax Media, and making it easier for workers within ZeniMax to unionize.

In a trailer that debuted at The Game Awards, the developer gave a look at the upcoming Palworld update, featuring a character who may be the new faction leader, as well as some of the new Pals and other new content coming to the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI_0U7-7hRA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mI_0U7-7hRA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Despite teasing a bunch of new content in the update, Pocketpair hasn't been forthcoming about what that new content is, leaving it to fans to analyze what's been shown in the trailer. As well as some unfamiliar Pals, the trailer appears to showcase a new base in a traditional Japanese building style, and it hints at some new mechanics that may include Pal-cloning vats.</p><p>Palworld has found itself in legal trouble over its similarity to Nintendo's long-running Pokemon franchise, with the two companies currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">embroiled in a lawsuit</a> over Pocketpair's alleged infringement of some of Nintendo's patents. Despite the legal challenge, the studio is continuing to release new content for the game, and has also teased a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-collaboration-is-coming-in-2025/1100-6528087/" data-ref-id="1100-6528087">Terraria collab</a> due out sometime next year</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-origins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a>, has laid off 99 developers.</p>
<p>Whilst the firm has not publicly confirmed the layoffs, <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2126300/wb-games-montreal-keywords-licenciements">Radio-Canada</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-developers">Game Developer</a>) reports 99 roles have been impacted, most of which work as subcontractors for its quality assurance team.

<p>According to anonymous sources who didn't want to be identified for fear of reprisal, staff were called to a video conference meeting on Monday, where the cuts were announced. Impacted colleagues were then invited to a separate call during which they were asked to choose between job hunting support or being placed on a recall list as and when the studio would pick up more work. The studio did stress, however, that this was unlikely to happen before 2026.</p>
<p>Colleagues impacted by the cuts told the news site they felt "stressed and depressed", especially to those with "families who are affected by this announcement and who are preparing to celebrate Christmas".</p>
<p>The redundancies were announced on the same day it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">confirmed that the beleagued Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would see no further new content beyond its fourth post-launch season</a>, which is now officially its last.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-cuts-more-than-120-jobs-in-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">People Can Fly also announced its second round of layoffs in less than a year</a>, this time affecting "more than 120" people. The move accompanies the cancellation or downsizing of several projects, with the studio blaming "external market pressures".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> is set to release in March 2025 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC with full cross-play. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 will also have closed beta tests, with<a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">&nbsp;sign-ups here</a> on the Killing Floor site.</p>
<p>The trailer takes us to Texas, where a zed outbreak has consumed a Horzine facility, and your of Nightfall characters will need to head in and clear things up.</p>
<p>It gives a first look at the Ninja, Medic and Sharpshooter character classes, as well as a glimpse of the Chimera boss.</p>

<p>These days, character classes also need to have, well, a character attached to them, and so we meet Luna as the Sharpshooter, whose rifles have high damage and penetration, with skills that can pivot her character from precision to run and gun marksman. Her gadget is the Death’s Hand, an explosive homing arrow.<i></i></p>
<p>Obi is the medic, who was fired from Horzine for being too ethical and not profitable enough. He keeps teammates alive with healing darts and grenades, pivoting character build from self preservation to healing allies. His gadget is Sanctum, a field projector that heals allies, while damaging and slowing enemies.&nbsp;<i></i></p>
<p>Finally there’s Nakata the ninja assassin, joining Nightfall to atone for his former sins. With swords and bows, he’s a melee specialist that can block and parry larger enemies, but can pivot from front line melee combat to more nimble hit and run tactics. His gadget is the Hebi-ken grappling hook, which can amp up attacks if you grapple to enemies.</p>
<p>There are six specialists with the game at launch, with the first three having been <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/news/nightfall-news-specialist-deep-dive/">revealed back in October</a>. These included Foster the Commando, Devlin the Firebug and Imran the Engineer.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

			<p>Shortly after its announcement, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> PC system requirements, detailing what players will need to run the game at different resolutions, quality settings, and target framerate.</p>
<p>The minimum system requirements targeting 1080p resolution, Low quality preset, and 30 FPS are not particularly demanding, although the game won't run on really old GPUs such as NVIDIA GTX series cards and anything older than the Radeon RX 6600. Interestingly enough, for 1080p resolution, Medium quality preset, 60 FPS and 4K resolution, High quality preset and 60 FPS, Windows 11 is recommended as the OS alongside beefier CPUs and GPUs. To enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at the highest resolution, highest quality setting, and 60 FPS, players will need either an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or Intel i7-10700 CPU and either a Radeon RX 7900 XTX or NVIDIA RTX 4080.</p>
<p>You can find the full Final Fantasy VII Rebirth system requirements below.</p>

		<p>Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, with the not too surprising news that their RPG sequel is also coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, in 2025. Oh, and day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, of course.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the notion of Xbox exclusivity for this game has been vented out the airlock, though that’s fairly sensible in this case. Microsoft acquired the studio back in 2018, but chose not to buy out the publishing deal with Private Division, which allowed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a> to release cross-platform across PS4, Xbox One and PC. The Outer Worlds 2 is Xbox published, but…. well, Xbox is effectively giving up on platform exclusivity. It’s not clear if this will be a simultaneous release, but there’s nothing to suggest timed exclusivity in this instance.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature within the Secret Level anthology series on Amazon Prime Video this month, with an episode dedicated to this universe to debut on 17th December, featuring a short story that takes place between the events of&nbsp;The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only Obsidian game out next year, with the tongue being removed from cheek for their more serious fantasy RPG adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed, coming out in February</a>. The Outer Worlds 2 will be a nice tonal companion to that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fumito Ueda, the man behind excellent games like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian, is working on a new project with his team genDESIGN.</p>
<p>This project, which has yet to be named, was revealed yesterday with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBSWSyk9Hg">trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards Show. Published by Epic Games, the yet-to-be-named project looks absolutely like what Fumito Ueda has done in the past, so we should probably expect creative gameplay and a really emotional story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Announcement Trailer For a New Upcoming Game From genDESIGN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNBSWSyk9Hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fumito Ueda and genDESIGN's last game was the aforementioned The Last Guardian, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2016 after being in development for over eight years. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-guardian-review/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last Guardian offers something I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in games before – a relationship that feels very, very tangible. Trico implies so many things with his animations, his glances, his whines, the way he stomps his feet – he drips with more personality and charisma than any other game character in recent memory, and all of this can be put down to the fact that he’s not just an NPC, not simply an AI model you must direct about a stage, he feels like a friend. A special friend who cries when you are hurt, nuzzles you when you can stand, and demands his belly rubbed if you want him to do some jumps.</em></p>

With tabs for both larger chapters and smaller sub-sections across each book, these tabs are a lifesaver.

Embroidered with the RollaCrit logo on the front and with an inside lining that flips to reveal you’ve been using a Mimic all along (!!), this shows off RollaCrit’s clever, tongue-in-cheek humor the company’s famous for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-7-how-an-unlikely-hero-called-wilmot-spawned-a-sustainable-franchise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Hollow Ponds / Logo via Game Developer</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How do you build a franchise in a way that's sustainable ? It's a question the industry is grappling with from top to bottom, with the largest studios attempting to craft billion-dollar series capable of crossing the transmedia divide and smaller devs perhaps hoping to turn their indie darlings into household names.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UK developer Hollow Ponds, the outfit behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hohokum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, might have found an answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio, along with a team of frequent collaborators, has crafted a burgeoning franchise around an unlikely figure. Enter Wilmot, the beaming warehouse manager and star of organizational puzzler </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Five years after the title debuted, Wilmot has swapped the stock-taking for jigsaw-making in laid back sequel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. At around the same time, Hollow Ponds also unveiled the Wilmot's Warehouse board game–a cooperative rollick developed with help from&nbsp;design studio and publisher CMYK and board game-focused outlet Shut Up &amp; Sit Down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how they transformed Wilmot from blue collar worker into an unassuming leading man, Hollow Ponds founder and creative director Ricky Haggett explains the studio initially benefited from a series of rather happy accidents–but a propensity for pragmatism also paid off. "We weren't like 'we're going to go big on Wilmot,'" explains Haggett, noting the board game and the video game sequel were "two completely different things."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although they eventually launched at a similar time, the board game actually coalesced during the pandemic. Before lockdown, Haggett would host regular board game hangouts with a few friends, including game designer, researcher, and lecturer David King. King has made a bunch of board games and would often bring concepts to those soirees–including a very roughshod morsel inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">King unveiled that particular concept during the very last meeting the group held before COVID-19 (and lockdowns) took hold. Yet, despite being in the primordial stages of development, Haggett was able to refine the idea, which riffs on the concept of the video game without replicating it directly, throughout the pandemic by continuing to host virtual game nights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We started figuring out what be a good size of grid. We started figuring out what a good cadence adding objects [would be]," he says. "For a while, we had things being added and taken away constantly. We had lots and lots of cards, which did lots of weird spatial things to the warehouse. We made lots of changes, and we just gradually whittled it down in a very unpressured way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and freedom. Two things most game developers crave, but can very rarely count on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says that by constantly tweaking the project during the pandemic, he was able to reach a point where it was 80 percent done by the time he approached CMYK. Shut Up &amp; Sit Down production and marketing manager Matt Lees also provided valuable feedback that "fixed the last weird problem" plaguing the project–which largely revolved around how to end the game by way of a frantic card-matching (or order fulfilment) phase. "The whole experience of designing that game was ego free," says Haggett. "People from all directions were suggesting things and having an open chat. [...] None of it generally felt stressful. It's actually a lovely antitheses to trying to fix all the bugs in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHa17b9fJAE?si=hSn7uEE_pFeS9TGk" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, where is the overlap between Wilmot's exploits in the digital and physical realms? Well, it's difficult to untangle. Haggett says Hollow Ponds has noticed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sales spikes that could be linked to the launch of the board game–although with the sequel also hitting shelves at a similar time, it's hard to separate the two. It has, however, visibly expanded the Wilmot footprint–a soaring achievement given the character's lack of feet. "We've definitely see people talk about the video game on board game-centric places saying 'hey, this is a video game as well,' and we've definitely seen people who just like the video game buying the board game, even though they're not necessarily board game people."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's cross-pollination, then, but what about the financial aspect? Haggett says Hollow Ponds hasn't quite made its money back on first quarter sales of the board game, but that it isn't far off. He notes that second quarter sales will include the holidays and retailers who've just ordered units, and feels the board game will be akin to a snowball gathering momentum. As we've already mentioned, it also landed at a fortuitous time, placing more eyes on Wilmot as Hollow Ponds prepared to debut a sequel in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett tells us that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is still pulling in thousands of pounds each quarter, but massively surpassed expectations when it launched in 2019 thanks in part to an Xbox Game Pass deal the studio secured. The company then received cash from Sony to deliver a PlayStation port. Haggett acknowledges those deals, however, are by no means guaranteed and advises caution when working on titles of that scale. "I think if you were making a Wilmot-sized game I would be scared of spending more than around £200,000," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the budget for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was bigger but still in the "low hundreds of thousands of pounds." Hollow Ponds also secured financing from the UK Games Fund (£25,000) that allowed them to hire a programmer to create a prototype, which according to Haggett was "pretty much what the game ended up being." It helped that Haggett was able to kickstart the project by taking the source code from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and stripping out all of the warehouse jiggery-pokery to create a "little jigsaw prototype." Meanwhile, Wilmot co-creator Richard Hogg set about creating the artwork that would become the myriad of jigsaws featured in-game, taking on a huge amount of work in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett estimates production took around 12 months in total, although that time was spread across years due to the need to support other projects. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched on Steam on October 23, 2024, for £12.79 (a similar price point to the first game) and sold twice as well as its predecessor during its first month on shelves. It marks the second title the studio has released in 2024 after multiplayer adventure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a much larger and more complex undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hasn't sold "incredibly well" but again highlights that Hollow Ponds was able to sign an Xbox Game Pass deal, presumably mitigating some financial risk. He remains "very happy" with the game itself, and notes the reception and feedback from players has been "great." Still, cashflow is important–and therein lies the balancing act.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Making big things is useful," says Haggett, explaining how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled the company to secure larger amounts of funding and work with influential publishers such as Annapurna Interactive. "But you can't guarantee you're going to be able to find publishers to fund your video games, and if you can't do that then it's helpful if you have smaller projects to fill in the cash flow at times," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, we're not a studio that has all of our employees working on a game. We don't really have many employees at all–we're a husband and wife team with one producer as a full-time employee. So when we finished </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we didn't have 20 people to support between projects. If we did we'd be screwed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nonetheless, there are gaps between [projects]. Even in the best case scenario there are naturally gaps. And its nice to be able to fill those with the smaller projects that bring in money that bumps the cashflow. Every little thing you have out there in the world is a little revenue stream, and it's a lot easier to get lots of little trickles of revenue from smaller, low-risk projects than massive mega projects."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era when phrases like 'survive to 2025' have (perhaps rather naively) been tossed around, perhaps there's something to be said for tempering blockbuster ambitions and championing reliable stalwarts like Wilmot.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The Headlines that matter">Status Report: The Headlines that matter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/itch-io-taken-down-by-collectible-maker-funko-and-ai-tool-brand-shield">Report: Itch.io taken down by collectible maker Funko and AI tool Brand Shield</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // Indie game marketplace itch.io was briefly taken down last weekend and co-founder Leaf Corcoran said the culprit was none other than collectible maker Funko. He claimed Funko is leveraging AI-powered brand protection technology called Brand Shield that sent a "bogus phishing report" to itch's registrar, which proceeded to disable the domain. The storefront was eventually restored, but the ordeal looks to have kickstarted a feud between Corcoran and the Funko Pop! maker. This might become the most bizarre beef in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/future-publishing-signs-content-partnership-with-openai">Future Publishing signs content partnership with OpenAI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // UK media company Future Publishing has signed a deal with OpenAI that will enable the ChatGPT maker to access content from its 200-plus brands.

Don't worry, though, because the French publisher also confirmed the games-as-as-service model will remain "central" to its business strategy moving forward.

		<p>It was a very late night if you were watching The Game Awards in the UK, but it wasn’t too hard to stay awake this year as the exciting announcements kept coming all the way to 4AM. What am I most excited about? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">Virtua Fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/split-fiction-is-the-new-co-op-game-from-josef-fares-and-he-only-used-a-few-rude-words-to-announce-it/">Split Fiction</a>, with at least one of them appearing next year. That’s all in the future though, and we’re here to talk about what we’ve been playing this week.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more time with Infinity Nikki, which is really just a very good open world platformer, whether you’re also keen on being a super helpful fashionista or not. I’ve also been playing through Indiana Jones and The Great Circle which captures the character unbelievably well. Besides that, it’s been some nostalgic Need for Speed Rivals, a spot of Snow Bros. Wonderland for review and Season 14 of Overwatch 2, where things have so far been looking up for Moira. I did dabble with Marvel Rivals too, but it didn’t hold my attention for too long, despite being a massive Marvel and Overwatch fan.</p>

<p>Before he stayed up right to the very end of The Game Awards, Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2 and a super scary new VR game that he can’t say anything about. He also played Marvel Rivals for precisely 7 minutes but said, “After that I couldn’t stand the ultra perky teenage girl who walks you through the mandatory tutorials.” Meanwhile, Gamoc has been playing The Thaumaturge for review, while squeezing in exactly one hour of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Jim spent most of his time playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review/">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</a> which he says, “I was initially excited for though ran into crashes that ultimately killed my hunger for that Nosgoth nostalgia hit. Hopefully the games are patched with a quick save feature or better checkpointing.” besides that he also jumped in two footed to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, playing more Darktide and Space Marine 2.</p>


<p>Aran has been playing Edge of Allegoria for review. He says, “It looks like a classic RPG from the Game Boy era, and plays like one. I wouldn’t have your kids play it though as it is very raunchy and full of adult themes. My full review should hopefully be up next week. I have also played some Marvel Rivals, and have found it pretty fun. I’ll see if I stick with it long-term though.”</p>
<p>Nic B has been playing the hell out of Pokémon TCG Pocket, telling us, “It’s good fun, but frustrating at times.”</p>
<p>Ade and his partner Laura have been playing the old-school styled RPG Sea of Stars on local co-op. He says, “It’s absolutely brilliant, you can play through the entire game together, solving puzzles and teaming up to take down enemies. It’s up there with It Takes Two for a local co-op experience, highly recommended! Other than that, a spot of Helldivers 2. I’ve been experimenting with Extreme mode, it’s ridiculous!</p>
<p>“Oh, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/">Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</a> for review, sadly, despite the early promise, it’s not very good!”</p>

<p>Steve told us, “I’ve been living out my dreams of academia by travelling around the world and punching various flavours of fascist on the nose in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The rest of my time has been taken by the rather less glamorous reality of marking undergraduate essays… I also found time to finish Mario and Luigi Brothership which is a solid 7 but nowhere near the levels of earlier games in the series. Finally, I’ve started Nine Sols and enjoying it aside from getting lost; determined to persevere with the default difficulty but there are a fabulous range of accessibility options.”</p>
<p>And finally, Tef also stayed up all the way through The Game Awards, but before that, he’s made a start on Space Marine 2 and like how stompy the Space Marines are when walking.</p>
<p>And what about you? Did you stay up for The Game Awards? Or have you been playing that little Indy game as well?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the leaked ad that <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the launch window of Mafia: The Old Country ahead of The Game Awards 2024, during the actual show we actually got to see the full trailer and learn more about the game. By far the most important tidbit is that, unlike all of its predecessors, Mafia: The Old Country won't be an open-world game. Hangar 13 describes it as a linear, narrative-driven title.</p>
<p>Nick Baynes, President of Hangar 13, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a love letter to old-style, gritty Mafia stories where players can uncover the origins of organized crime. Everyone at Hangar 13 is committed to creating the most authentic and intense story of the franchise, and we can’t wait for players to experience the journey with Enzo.</em></p>
<p>The press release from publisher 2K explains that it will be a 'focused package' with a 'graphically stunning cinematic experience'. Its story, set in the fictional Sicilian town of San Celeste, is rooted in the brutal world of organized crime that aims to immerse players in dangerous combat systems with high-stakes, grounded stealth and gunplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Enzo is the game's main character. He survived a childhood of forced labor in Sicily's hellish sulphur mines. Eventually, through a twist of fate, he gets the opportunity to join Don Torrisi's crime family and will do whatever it takes to make a better life for himself. By swearing an oath, Enzo has committed himself to the Torrisi family code of honor, with all the power and hardship that entails. He must never forget this simple truth: family requires sacrifice. To reach his next destination or make a hasty getaway, Enzo will need to gallop across cobbled streets and open fields on horseback or speed along dirt roads in authentic turn-of-the-century cars.</p>

<p>We also learned that Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, marking yet another triple-A studio that switches away from its proprietary engine. The game will be available in Summer 2025 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9p834n9s4ll0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>.</p>

			<p>Finally, during last night's busy The Game Awards 2024 show, Pearl Abyss announced the release window for Crimson Desert. We first&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard </a>about the game at G-Star 2019, when it was presented as a spiritual sequel to the studio's Black Desert featuring similar MMO elements.</p>
<p>The following year, the South Korean developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a switch from MMO to open world action/adventure while also sharing a preliminary Winter 2021 target window. Needless to say, that did not pan out, and Pearl Abyss actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> Crimson Desert indefinitely. It wasn't until Gamescom 2023 that the game re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged</a> with a new trailer. In late 2023, Korean media <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a new Q2 2025 launch window.</p>
<p>That prediction wasn't far off, as Crimson Desert is now officially set to launch in Fall 2025 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> (including Mac, according to the press release), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/crimson-desert/9ng592g0w474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is now available on all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn1igh_q0Wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pearl Abyss also shared a bit more about the game's features. Players take the role of Kliff, leader of the Greymanes, a band of battle-hardened mercenaries who fight to save the land of Pywel from impending disaster. As they explore the vast landscapes, players will engage in intense battles, defeat formidable monsters, collect valuable loot, and follow the story of the Greymanes' journey.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a strategically rich combat experience, whether you're fighting an intense one-on-one duel or battling through massive hordes of foes. Crimson Desert will feature 'monumental boss fights' that, once complete, unlock unique weapons and armor or even new abilities. Kliff can also soar through the skies by commanding, riding, and controlling wyverns for thrilling aerial combat.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the next-generation BlackSpace Engine, featuring dynamic weather, time, and environmental changes. From a gameplay standpoint, players will be able to enjoy rock climbing, gliding, fishing, cooking, and so much more. They will encounter mechanized villages, intricate puzzles, and interactive aerial Abysses that promise 'endless discovery'.</p>
<p>The Steam page also listed the minimum and recommended system requirements, which we've added below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/helldivers-ii-update-omens-of-tyranny-now-available<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the details below, via Arrowhead Game Studios social media and community manager Katherine Baskin.</p><div><p>The time has come, Helldivers. The War has changed.</p><p>These are dark times for freedom loving citizens everywhere. Our galaxy grows cold from the embrace of old enemies returning and darkens with the threat of new <a title="Genres > Horror [539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s emerging.</p><p>We must now stand together in Super Earth’s light and oppose these sinister tidings. These Omens of Tyranny.</p><p><strong>The Illuminate Return</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Missing for almost a century, the Illuminate will challenge our recruits more than the other factions they have faced. They are advanced, highly-intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic.</p><p>At the end of the First Galactic War, the Helldivers worked together to eradicate the Illuminate. We believed we were successful, and for nearly 100 years, we have lived in relative peace, holding the Terminid and Automaton threats at bay. Thanks to our continued recruitment and training of new Helldivers, we have held these two fronts with complete, unmitigated success.</p><p>But now the Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.</p><p>The Illuminate are spreading through mind control, abducting citizens of weaker dedication to democratic ideals and brainwashing them for a dark purpose which is still yet unknown to us. These mind-controlled citizens have been twisted and corrupted into a menace we call The Voteless—Super Earth’s own people turned against the principles of Democracy and fair elections, losing their ability to vote entirely.</p><p>The intentions behind the Illuminate invasion are still unclear. Right now, they remain as smaller bands of insurgents, staging attacks, building mysterious structures, and abducting citizens before disappearing again.</p><p>It’s up to us to stop them from getting their totalitarian tentacles any deeper into Super Earth’s domain.</p><p><strong>The Fight at Our Doorstep</strong></p><p>Omens of Tyranny is bringing the fight into the streets, with new mission areas inside Super Earth’s many colonies.</p><p>View and download image<br>Our colonies are being ravaged by these invaders, turning our once bright and sunny streets filled with smiling citizens into dark ruins, overrun by Voteless and Illuminate. Arm yourselves with your trusted tools of destruction and rid our colonies of this scum.</p><p>But it won’t be easy. Gone are the wide-open spaces that Helldivers are accustomed to fighting in. Cities mean closer quarters, dark alleys, and forked paths where one wrong turn means meeting a horde of Voteless to liberate. You’ll need your best and brightest squad to navigate them carefully.</p><p><strong>Go Easy on the Gun, Chief</strong></p><p>With all these new developments, there won’t be time to take driver’s ed. courses, Helldiver. A Fast Recon Vehicle “FRV” will now appear in the colonies, ready to plow through the Illuminate at high speed.</p><p>Keep following the Major Orders issued by Super Earth High Command and you will get the keys to your very own FRV–a brand new, top-of-the-line manual transmission reconnaissance and combat vehicle. The whole squad can ride together, and your passengers can even lean out of the windows to lay down some suppressive fire as you shift gears and speed to your next destination. Just one question left: Who’s driving?</p><p>There’s more to discover yet, and we can’t wait to get you back into the fight.</p><p>The newest major update for <em>Helldivers II,</em> “Omens of Tyranny,” featuring the return of the Illuminate faction, is now live! High Command has ordered all Helldivers to report to their Super Destroyers—it’s time to give these squids hell.</p><p><strong>Introducing DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition</strong></p><p>Eliminate bugs, bots and squids with the Super Earth Ministry of Defense’s sleek new DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition, sporting the iconic yellow and black armor paint scheme.</p><p>The DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition will be available in limited quantities for $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99. Pre-orders start on December 20, 2024 at participating retailers, with launch on February 6, 2025. The exact launch date and availability for the controller may vary by country/region.</p><p>Starting Friday, December 20 at 10:00 a.m. ET in the U.S. and 10:00 a.m. local time in the U.K., France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Austria, and Portugal, players will be able to pre-order the DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition exclusively through direct.playstation.com.</p></div><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
