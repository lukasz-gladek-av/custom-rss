At the same time, rewrites and reshoots have definitely hamstrung some movies in the MCU. I’m sure the <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> team would love a mulligan, though there’s no evidence that’s the case here. <br></p><p>We still have no real idea what this next phase of the MCU will revolve around, other than Disney seemingly going back to the well and trying to resurrect the franchise’s earlier magic.

One thing the Star Wars spin-off can rest assured of is that no other major video games will be releasing around it that month. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting trading card crossovers in years is nearly here. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy releases on June 13</a>. The upcoming set has been steadily building in hype since its announcement, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-trailer"><u>new trailer</u></a> has since kicked the excitement up an extra notch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to get your hands on the set, you're in luck. There's a lot <em>out of stock</em> right now, but several of the elusive Final Fantasy MTG sets are now back in stock at Amazon, Walmart, and TCG Player, including the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxJv3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Play Booster Box</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the market price of that booster set has also surged this month. Only a few weeks ago you could pick it up for<a href="https://zdcs.link/akKXAr?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>$164.99 from TCGPlayer</u></a>; it's now just over $179. Amazon had also restocked at $189.99 again (sold and shipped directly), up from the original listing's $144.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4LB7?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>nine-booster Final Fantasy bundle (plus bonus cards)</u></a> for $89.92, despite still being available to preorder for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w7pj?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$70 at Walmart</a>, alongside<a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwAZB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>single sealed boosters</u></a> that have risen from $7.99 to $9.19 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is "Market Price"? Those collecting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> will be wildly familiar with the concept, but it's where retailers will take liberties with the "recommended" part of an MSRP, and list it for what they think folk will pay. Capitalism at its finest, I know, and for Final Fantasy MTG, "Market Price" is currently around $20-40 over MSRP, depending on what you're buying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can stomach the cost, with the rest of the sets sold out and some singles already going for over $500, you'll want to lock in your preorders before everything vanishes faster than you can say Chocobo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices in the singles market are looking remarkably high as well, with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY5y6?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a>, currently sitting at $147.23, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Oy5?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Surge Foil version</a> is at an almighty $599, the most expensive of the entire FF set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've already preordered, or are just on the hunt for rare singles, there are a few other clear standouts to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the gorgeous <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ7nB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Kefka, Court Mage card</a>, shown off in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-yoshitaka-amano-teaser"><u>new MTG teaser trailer</u></a> from PAX East, and featuring longtime Final Fantasy artist, Yoshitaka Amano.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgWvw?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCG Player</a> is good spot for a wide collection of single cards you can purchase and add to your deck without having to hope for a good pull. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a good resource for figuring out how much your cards are worth once the new set is out, so if you pull any Surge Foil cards in your booster pack preorders, you might suddenly find yourself with quite the nest egg. But, it's also worth noting that prices change all the time, so some cards may change in value closer to release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other highlights to look out for when opening boosters, or to consider buying standalone, include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OYxn?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Ex-Soldier Commander card,</a> which costs $45.99 at the time of writing. That’s not surprising, given how easy it makes it for equipping other creatures you might have in play on the field. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's also the full-art version of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xD8y?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yuffie Kisaragi - Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</a>, currently just under $100. That’s due to both the card’s use as a Commander and its rarity, especially in that classic late 90’s FF7 art style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s when you get to some of the special cards where things get extra expensive, though. Alongside that eye watering $599 Cloud card, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47GKA?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of the Traveling Chocobo card</a>, costs $169.98, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03YE3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standard version</a> stands at a cheaper, but still expensive $114.97. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also buy the new Traveling Chocobo cards, which even had their own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-limited-gold-chocobo-teaser"><u>teaser trailer featuring a limited edition Gold Chocobo</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it can be expensive when seeking out the rarest cards, quite a number of singles at TCG player can also be bought at a low price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the likes of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWwVm?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sazh’s Chocobo for $1.96</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgw0D?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tonberry for $2.49</a>, the useful <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW7vm?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summon: Shiva for $1.56</a>, or even <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GXpP?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gladiolus Amicitia for 33 cents</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moreover, TCG Player is also hosting preorders for select Final Fantasy booster sets, albeit at over MSRP, but at current market price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, for those just preordering the Starter Kit today, it is also worth noting that each deck in the set is preconstructed, and doesn't feature boosters to open (so no surprise $600 cards).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Set First Looks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, it includes one traditional foil legendary creature, five brand-new non-foil cards debuting in Magic, and 54 cards from the main set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The kit also comes with four non-foil double-sided tokens, two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-arena">MTG Arena</a> code cards (one per deck), and two deck boxes. That’s a lot of value packed into a $20 price tag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For new Magic: The Gathering players, the Arena code cards are especially useful.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-any-time-soon-former-dice-developer-says-despite-player-surge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">Star Wars: Battlefront 2 might be enjoying a player resurgence</a>, but fans shouldn't expect a Battlefront 3 announcement anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to a former employee who worked on Star Wars: Battlefront 2's live operations at developer DICE, who has been responding to player questions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Matshelge/comments/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii">Star Wars: Battlefront 2</a>, originally released in 2017, has seen its player count rise rapidly since the start of this month, fuelled by the franchise's annual May 4 celebrations and the critically-acclaimed return of Star Wars TV series Andor. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's renewed popularity has fans clamouring for more — and to be fair, after eight years, you might expect publisher EA to have something up its sleeve. But, according to former live producer of BF2, Mats Holm, that is unlikely to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally," Holm wrote, referring to the recent uptick in Battlefield 2 player numbers. "But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Holm, the biggest issue holding up a new game is that the majority of the Battlefront 2 team are no longer at DICE.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We spread all over," Holm revealed. "A few went to Ubisoft, some went independent, some to King, Avalanche, Star Stables, Paradox, Starbreeze, Mojang to name a few. Some left Stockholm to join game companies abroad as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Embark has a lot of the people who made base game, but the people who made the live game did not leave in a pack. We all slowly drifted after being put on Battlefield."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Andor Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked whether DICE could still make a new Battlefront game without its previous team members, Holm admitted he was "sceptical." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The live team ended up approaching the game very differently than the original devs," Holm wrote, referring to how the team who continued making Battlefront 2 content post-launch turned around the game's fortunes following a shaky start. "If they went about it the same way as before, they will not get how we brought the game back from the abyss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, if their goal was 'let's learn everything from their work,' perhaps. If they are 'new game, Battlefield but in Star Wars outfits' it won't turn out well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, only "about three people" are left from Battlefront 2's live team at DICE, the developer continued. There's also the issue that, for now <a href="https://in.ign.com/untitled-battlefield-game/230398/news/battlefield-6-electronic-arts-reveals-new-details-for-the-upcoming-game-including-playtest-expansion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE is busy throwing all of its development weight into getting its big new Battlefield game</a> finished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in a perfect universe, the developer said they would like to see the franchise continue — although they wouldn't make Battlefield 3 next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hear me out — no Battlefront 3 right now, but Battlefront 2 Remaster for whatever future console is arriving in 2027-28," the developer suggested. "Dev time is around 2-3 years. There is a laundry list of improvements that this game could get in my opinion, and getting it updated was always on our wishlist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once that is a success, then start work on 3. You have a team familiar with engine, assets and really could kick off developing a 3 within a much shorter time span, and working on feedback from a fresh Battlefront 2 audience base. This would be a 5-6 year plan, but it's far more likely to be a success."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Improvements for Battlefront 2 would include cross-play, day/night cycles and dynamic weather for all planets, a 1-vs-1 mode and more, the developer concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"List is endless, but [these options] were off the table as we were in live, not [original game] production," the developer concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A Song of Ice and Fire writer George R. R. Martin, who wrote Game of Thrones and helped create <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a>'s world, is attached as a producer on the movie, as is Vince Gerardis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sigh why? No one ask[ed] for this keep FromSoftware away from hollyweird plz," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ktetgx/comment/mtsyb14/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>complained</u></a> one player, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqs5g5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "I was hoping it was just a meme. This movie is going to be a pretty looking mess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are worried about the storyline, given so much of Elden Ring's lore is implied and has chiefly been interpreted by the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the the main problem with adapting any of the Fromsoft Souls games into movies, almost all the lore is interpreted by the fan base, very rarely will the games tell you very directly about anything, a movie can't be like that since it'll try to appeal to the majority of people, so things will be spelled out in great detail, ignoring one of the main attractions of these type of games," one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqvfva/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqt548/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Another</u></a> suggested that while that may be the case if a story was based upon the Tarnished, "a movie around the lore or NPCs?

Even putting aside his game-writing credentials (he wrote Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry), in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jucgre/comment/mm14377/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a Reddit AMA</u></a> last month, Garland revealed he was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9iot/director_and_writer_of_a24s_elden_ring_adaption/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>currently on an NG+6 run of Shadow of the Erdtree</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Have you seen [Garland's] films?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ktd6ni/comment/mtsq30b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked this player</u></a>. "They're excellent movies but they're a bit weird and so they cause mixed opinions. They're very 'artistic' in the sense that a lot of people bounce off them for being 'weird'. This, in my opinion, is exactly the guy you want involved in an Elden Ring movie because he can handle weird."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Garland makes amazing stuff and I was gonna say this is an out-there director choice, but he did make Ex Machina which is all sorts if f***ed up," this player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqqujq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. "Could be epic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Say what you will about the idea of an Elden Ring movie, but at the very least we’re in the best hands possible with Garland," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9iot/comment/mts3c9e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> this impressed player. "Go watch his video with [Last of Us creator] Neil Druckmann if you need any convincing that he will be as true as possible to the source material."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, plot, casting details, and a release date for the Elden Ring movie have yet to be announced, and fans are also speculating on that, too, including a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9q51/so_is_jack_black_gonna_play_godrick_or_what/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cheeky recommendation</u></a> for Jack Black to play Godrick — or Torrent; I've seen suggestions for both — and another for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt7rv6/now_that_the_movies_been_confirmed_i_hope/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chris Pratt as a Tarnished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the movie world, Elden Ring has continued to attract gaming fans with more content in the years since its release.

<p dir="ltr">Catalysts are the base power of the spell, with Blizzard describing it as the "foundation." There are six Catalysts to choose from, like Disintegrate and Propulsion, that will give the spell its form and function.</p><p dir="ltr">Next are Infusions, which imbue the spell with its elemental damage type and some special effects. Lastly, players can equip three Arcana, which are used to modify the spell in a variety of ways, from granting players Unstoppable after using their Horadric spell to gaining Stealth for several seconds after use. Some Legendary Arcana grant fairly powerful effects, like the Floaty Bobble Arcana, which adds a Blink component to the spell, or the Bloody Charm, which simply executes non-boss enemies with 10% life or less when the spell is activated.</p><p dir="ltr">The Horadric Spellcraft system isn't entirely different from how seasonal powers have worked in previous seasons (a common complaint among the playerbase), but does seem to give players more flexibility than before in terms of both what powers and what damage types they want to use.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Horadric Spellcrafting will just be one component of Season 9. Blizzard, in its quest, to continue improving base elements of Diablo 4's endgame (as detailed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap</a>) is also putting a heavy emphasis on Nightmare dungeons, with new positive affixes that will benefit players in the form of more specialized crafting rewards or specific types of gear. Players will also (finally) be able to jump into a new Nightmare dungeon while still inside a different one, rather than having to leave the dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">New for the season will be Horadric Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares. Strongrooms are mini-dungeons inside Nightmare dungeons where players will use a wayfinder to find a hidden Horadric vault. Players will need to battle through demons in a set amount of time in order to claim the Strongroom's rewards, and the difficulty of the Strongroom, and its rewards, can be adjusted and increased by activating various modifiers similar to players add modifiers in the Infernal Hordes activity. Additionally, players earn Horadric Jewels to put in their gear to further modify their Horadric spell.</p><p dir="ltr">Escalating Nightmares is a new spin on Nightmare dungeons that sees the effects of three different Nightmare dungeons stack in succession. Players will need to earn Escalation Sigils from Horadric Storerooms to challenge the Escalating Nightmares. Those who survive all three dungeons in succession will then battle against a new boss encounter with Astaroth, who players may remember from Diablo 4's base campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 will be playable on the game's PTR from May 27 to June 3, as Blizzard looks to test the season's new systems as well as various balance changes and new Unique items. According to Diablo 4's in-game timers, Season 9 proper will begin July 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Diablo 4 Season 8, Belial's Return, is in full swing, having revamped the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-patch-notes-introduce-endgame-boss-overhaul/1100-6531150/" data-ref-id="1100-6531150">endgame boss cycle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">battle pass</a> (the latter of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">hasn't exactly gone over well</a>).

                <p>After Bungie was hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">plagiarism allegations for its Marathon revamp</a>, more information has been revealed about other problems within the company. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">Aside from a toxic work environment</a> coming from the top of Bungie, company heads were pitching to give <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> a subscription service on top of already paying for a PlayStation Plus membership.</p><p>Former Bungie employees spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly belittle staff.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," said a former Destiny 2 developer, which was the focus point for many former employees. When higher-ups pitched a subscription model for Destiny 2, it was only allegedly shut down due to the staff's "vehement" opposition. That would mean players would pay for a sub on top of other necessary subs like PS Plus, depending on your platform. Bungie's leadership followed that up by reportedly holding a meeting where the staff were given a "monetization scolding" for not enabling enough microtransactions.</p><p>Bungie has made numerous changes to Destiny 2's monetization since its launch nearly eight years ago, including a shift to a free-to-play model. The company has had to increase the relevance of the Eververse store and seasonal content passes, both of which include paid cosmetics.</p><p>In late 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Bungie reduced its workforce by over 300 roles</a>, after a drastic fall in revenue. This put even more pressure on different methods of monetizing its games.</p><p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">were part of these layoffs</a> and general sentiment around Marathon has not been the best, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/">its developers are asking fans to give the game a chance</a>, despite the surrounding controversy.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a>.</p>

For example, this updated version highlights the members of the Cobra Unit who were absent from the original. “Snake Eater” has also been re-recorded by its original performer, Cynthia Harrell.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a complete remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. The original story and voice acting have been preserved, but the game features enhancements such as 3D audio and new graphical flourishes, such as Snake's clothing degrading over time. The control scheme has been reworked and modernized, but fans can still play using the classic control setup. Additionally, the remake lets players choose between experiencing the game using a new third-person behind-the-shoulder view and the original game's overhead viewpoint (known as Legacy Style).&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can pick up Naked Snake's revamped adventure when it launches on August 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA's reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series was a roller coaster of a journey, to say the least. The 2015 game was liked but blasted for a lack of content, an offline mode, and no campaign.</p>
<p>Then the 2017 sequel was, by all accounts, a noted improvement gameplay-wise, but the microtransactions that EA stuffed into it practically killed the game, driving players away at launch. EA supported the game for another three years and was able to turn the ship around with the removal of its awful microtransactions, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-visuals-improvements/">consistent updates</a> to improve the game, culminating in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-celebration-edition-leaks/">Celebration Edition</a> of the game that gave players access to every piece of content that was previously paywalled.</p>
<p>But neither the reboot nor the original series ever made it to a third entry. Star Wars Battlefront III has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-iii-pitched/">pitched</a> and even worked on, in the case of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-star-wars-battlefront-3-free-radical">original PS2-era series,</a> but never made it to fruition.</p>
<p>Hope rises for Battlefront III once again after a recent surge in popularity in Battlefront II, and (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-wars-battlefront-2-devs-want-to-get-the-band-back-together-to-make-battlefront-3/">VGC</a>), developers who worked on Battlefront II want to "<em>get the gang back together</em>" to make Battlefront III.</p>
<p>Responding to a comment on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3"> Reddit</a> about a previous comment he had made that Battelfront II developers want to see the series get a third entry, Mats Helge Holm, who worked as a producer on Battelfront II, said, "<em>Me,</em> <em>having heard around my group of ex-colleagues, we want to get the gang back together.</em>"</p>
<p>Holm isn't the only one who has worked on Star Wars making the call for Battlefront III. Andor actor Muhannad Ben Amor also called for Battlefront III on<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes"> Instagram</a>, admitting he's a massive Battlefront fan, having logged 469 hours in Battlefront II.</p>
<p>Even with this new surge in popularity, players shouldn't be expecting EA to green-light a new Battlefront game anytime soon. In the thread where Holm comments that he and other former members of the Battlefront II team would like to work together again on Battlefront III, he says, "<em>I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally. But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it</em>."</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Battlefront II, it's worth hopping back in to enjoy the rush of players filling up matches. But keep your expectations in check regarding the chances of a third game ever happening.</p>

A24 announced <em>Elden Ring </em>is the latest hit game slated to get a live-action adaptation, with Ex Machina and <em>Civil War</em>’s Alex Garland signed on to direct. What exactly the result will be is anyone’s guess, and fans aren’t quite sure whether to praise the sun or get ready for a flop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The brutal but massively acclaimed 2022 action-RPG has sold over 30 million copies, making it a straightforward choice for Hollywood to take a shot at in terms of the financial upside. But while some game movies have recently hit big at the box office, like <em>Sonic</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, others aimed at more mature audiences—like <em>Borderlands</em>—have been epic failures. </p><p>The <em>Elden Ring</em> project doesn’t have a tentative release date yet and about the only other thing we know so far is that the production team includes some combination of: Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R. R. Martin. That last name is important not just because he’s the author behind the <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but also because he collaborated with FromSoftware on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s story and world building. </p><p>Precisely how much he was involved remains up for debate. Martin seems happy to involve himself in any creative endeavor that will delay him from finally finishing the last two books in his<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> fantasy series, <em>The Winds of Winter </em>and <em>A Dream of Spring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> fans, a famously chill bunch, aren’t sure how to feel about the whole thing. </p><p>Garland has been on a writing and directing blitz. Following his acclaimed sci-fi horror <em>Ex Machina</em> and his adaptation of the <em>Annihilation</em> books, he’s recently put out the American political horror flick <em>Civil War</em>, this year’s Iraq invasion movie <em>Warfare</em>, and a bunch of <em>28 Days Later </em>spin-offs. How would his horror chops influence <em>Elden Ring </em>on the big screen? </p><p>Given it’s an A24 production, there’s a good chance Garland and company will have a lot of latitude with the mood of an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie and how it’s shot, with more artistic license than a conventional game adaptation aimed at a mass audience might be offered. And of course there’s whatever role publisher Bandai Namco will play in all of this, as well as FromSoftware itself. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has been integral to the studio’s unique brand of storytelling, including <em>Elden Ring</em>, but has no confirmed role in the adaptation at the moment.</p><p>You should actually watch an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland did with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann</a></span> if you want to get a good sense of how he thinks about storytelling in games and movies. I can imagine a very stoic, near wordless script that focuses an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie primarily on the mythology and horror of The Lands Between, which is in some ways comparable to zombie Camelot. </p><p> FromSoftware’s boss creature designs, extravagant and larger-than-life, seem like a challenging fit for a live-action production without a Disney-level budget for special effects. Then again, the team on <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved you don’t need tons of money to make an incredible-looking monster movie. I wonder if Guillermo del Toro was offered a shot at <em>Elden Ring</em> and passed. It certainly seems more up his alley than Garland’s. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega has announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition</a>, and it's not coming to PlayStation 5--at least not right away. The new version is coming for Xbox Series X|S and PC, but there is no word yet on a potential release for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The game launches on June 10, and it'll be available through Xbox Game Pass. On PC, people can buy it through Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YxYLWIJfP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7YxYLWIJfP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Given the day-one launch for Game Pass, some are theorizing that Microsoft might have cut a deal with Sega for this. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-cod-under-microsoft-wont-try-to-do-slimy-platform-things/1100-6524115/" data-ref-id="1100-6524115">trying to give players a choice about where they play their games</a>, as opposed to doing "slimy platform things to force you to do what I want." Space Marine is a Sega-published game, however.</p><p>The game, developed by Relic Entertainment, was originally released in 2011 for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. The new Master Crafted edition marks the first time Space Marine will be playable on any Xbox other than Xbox 360 because it never came to the backwards-compatible program for newer Xbox consoles.</p><p>The Master Crafted edition is developed by SneakyBox and features 4K resolution, modernized controls, an overhaul to the interface, improved character models, and remastered audio. Producer Vaidas Mikelskas told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-warhammer-40000-space-marine-gets-surprise-master-crafted-edition-on-pc-and-xbox-game-pass-but-theres-no-ps5-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the game "isn't just a technical upgrade--it's a thoughtful restoration."</p><p>Space Marine 2 followed in 2024, and Space Marine 3 is now in the works.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the big announcements from the recent Warhammer Skulls event in the gallery below.</p>

Maximizing your income is the real aim of the game here, so that leaves precious little space for the horde of employee beds required to get a little help with labor. Now, in its open beta, Schedule 1 will no longer require employees to be registered to beds.</p><p>Instead, you'll be able to place a locker, which has a much smaller footprint, and removes the possibility of employee pathways becoming entangled, leading to some very confused, and very stuck, NPCs. Solo developer TVGS does mention in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546735912086667480?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes </a>that existing employees will still need to be assigned to beds for "compatibility reasons" but that any new employees can use lockers instead.</p><p>Of course, the obvious solution is to fire everyone, remove their beds, place lockers, and rehire them--if you can be bothered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499701-scheduleireleasetrailer0-5screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499701-scheduleireleasetrailer0-5screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499701"></a><figcaption>Schedule 1 employees now take up far less space.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499701-scheduleireleasetrailer0-5screenshot.png"></figure><p>This beta includes the save file consolidation changes mentioned in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-patch-notes-introduce-a-new-feature-useful-to-all-players/1100-6531398/" data-ref-id="1100-6531398">last set </a>of patch notes, which means that NPCs and properties save under a single file, reducing the time saves take, and improving Steam cloud-syncing functionality.</p><p>Alongside these adjustments, the new storage unit can now house three employees, meaning efficiency is on the rise. Trash cans will now show the area they apply to as you're placing them down, too.</p><p>As well as a host of bug fixes, item-slot filters have also been added to the game. This means that certain slots on storage shelves can have specific items blacklisted, so your perfectly organized farmhouse will no longer descend into chaos when left in the hands of your employees.</p><p>Rounding off the patch notes, TVGS says that an in-game voting system is in the works, with the first vote likely to commence next week. Here, you can vote on which features you'd like to see in the next major update. Those features are "likely" to be a cartel update, a police expansion, or the addition of Shrooms to manufacturable products.</p><p>These updates are only on the beta branch of the game. To access it, right-click Schedule 1 in your Steam inventory and select properties. Then, click "betas" and select the "beta" branch. As some of these features are experimental, make sure to back up your save before changing over.</p>

			<p>A Gears of War: Reloaded beta could be announced soon, judging from what has been recently discovered.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ktfpwe/gears_of_war_reloaded_beta_to_be_announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the unannounced beta was added to the Steam backend yesterday, as seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3749450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, so it's likely that it will be officially confirmed soon. Unfortunately, there is no information on when the beta could take place or what it will offer.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded will mark the PlayStation debut of one of the series that has long been synonymous with the Xbox brand. Announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/"> earlier this month</a>, the game is a remaster of the first entry in the series developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, featuring all the content released for the original, as well as that included in the Ultimate Edition, such as the single-player campaign, all post-launch DLC, and every multiplayer map and play mode. The remaster will also enhance the experience with 4K resolution support on all platforms, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS in multiplayer, HDR and VRR support, visual improvements, and cross-platform progression and multiplayer.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded launches on August 25th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Those who purchased the Ultimate Edition before the remaster's announcement on May 5th will get the remaster via a free upgrade.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-lineup-gets-four-more-retro-classics.1197486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added four more retro Game Boy classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, so if you like your cult classics, then you're in for a treat.</p>

<p>Game Boy games, along with games from other systems, are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong" rel="nofollow">sporadically added</a> to the subscription service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">library</a>, and unlike Nintendo 64 games (or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">upcoming GameCube library</a> for Switch 2), you won't need an Expansion Pack for these titles.</p>

<p>First to be added in today's haul is the 1999 Konami game&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids</em>, which features some pretty innovative open-world survival gameplay for its time. It's a forefather of the DS'&nbsp;<em>Lost in Blue&nbsp;</em>series, and a new&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids&nbsp;</em>game is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">heading to the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-kids-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025.jpg?itok=tkyCKQNk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-kids-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025.jpg?itok=ssPIt_rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Survival Kids&nbsp;</em>is one of four games joining the Nintendo Switch Online library today.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up is side-scrolling shooter&nbsp;<em>Gradius The Interstellar Assault</em>, which brings the series' trademark frantic spaceship action to the small screen. If you're a fan of previous (or subsequent)&nbsp;<em>Gradius&nbsp;</em>titles, you'll probably love this one too.</p>

<p>Your third new Game Boy game in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Kirby's Star Stacker</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Puzzle League</em>-style descending block puzzler that takes&nbsp;<em>Kirby&nbsp;</em>aesthetics and transposes them into a&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em>-style gameplay system.</p>

<p>Finally, today's Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy lineup brings&nbsp;<em>The Sword of Hope&nbsp;</em>to Nintendo Switch Online. It's an RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Kid Klown&nbsp;</em>studio Kemco, and while it's a little basic by today's standards, it's still got a rough charm to it.</p>

<p>All four of these games were previously available in the West, so none of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" rel="nofollow">getting a release outside Japan</a> for the first time, but some of them are likely not to have graced your Game Boy shelf in the past given their rarity.</p>




<p>You can play all four of these Game Boy games right now on Nintendo Switch Online if you've got an active subscription, and if you haven't, then you can sign up for one via your console's eShop.</p>

Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are standing on a hill with the Jackson settlement they’ll call home in the distance. Ellie, unconvinced by Joel’s story about raiders massacring the Firefly revolutionaries who were looking to make a cure for the cordyceps fungus, asks the smuggler to swear that everything he said is true. Joel hesitates and then says that he swears. However, rather than keeping the now-iconic hard cut to black on Ellie’s skeptical face as she says “okay,” season two shows her walking down the hill and leaving Joel in an uncomfortable silence. This unnecessary addition to a scene that was once perfect is a pretty concise encapsulation of the season’s biggest problems. But it’s hardly the most egregious example in this episode.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994"><em>The Last Of Us</em> Season Two, Episode One Recap: Everybody Hates Joel</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Welcome back to another recap of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ.."><em>The Last of Us</em> season two</a></span>.

                <p>Nintendo has revealed four new games coming to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy library today, May 23. They are Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirbys-star-stacker/" data-ref-id="5000-6379">Kirby Star Stacker</a> is the highest-profile addition. Originally released by HAL Laboratory in 1997, it is a puzzle game with gameplay similar to Tetris Attack or Pokemon Puzzle League. Players have to match blocks that look like Rick, Coo, and Kine from Kirby's Dream Land 2. The Super Famicom version of this game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-brings-three-games-to-us-for-first-time-ever/1100-6517513/" data-ref-id="1100-6517513">came to Nintendo Switch Online in 2023</a>, but now the original release also has a place as part of Nintendo's subscription service.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRmpwGGTXOo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/survival-kids-1999/" data-ref-id="5000-11627">Survival Kids</a> is another notable inclusion this month because it's a Konami franchise about to be reimagined for Nintendo Switch 2. The original Survival Kids is a cult classic that tasks players with surviving on a deserted island. If you enjoy modern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a>, they owe a lot to games like Survival Kids that helped trailblaze some of the genre's mechanics. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> of Survival Kids looks like a lighthearted, cooperative reinterpretation of the series' formula, it's nice to have the rare Game Boy original available through Switch Online now.</p><p>Game Boy enthusiasts will also enjoy the other two games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gradius-the-interstellar-assault/" data-ref-id="5000-15933">Gradius: The Interstellar Assault</a> is a solid Game Boy version of Konami's classic arcade shoot 'em up. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sword-of-hope/" data-ref-id="5000-16075">The Sword of Hope</a> is an ambitious but lesser-known RPG for Nintendo's handheld console.</p><p>Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope all now available to play through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

The clip here is only 40 seconds long and it contains brand-new footage, but don't get too hyped up unless you're a fan of post-apocalyptic environmental ASMR.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRutwoEyG3s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRutwoEyG3s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In case you can't click the video above, all you're missing out on is a brief clip of an open prepper shelter waiting for a brave deliveryman to come pick up some cargo. At the very least, it's a nice look at the more arid terrain that you'll be able to explore in Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Beyond that tissue-pack marketing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a>. This model features a sleek black finish and insignia based on the fictional Drawbridge company in the sequel, and it's priced at $85. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2 releases for PS5 on June 26</a>, and several previews for the game recently went live.</p><p>While feedback has been mostly positive so far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/">game director Hideo Kojima isn't satisfied</a> and he wants to see a few "controversial" opinions about the sequel.</p><p>"I played 30 hours of Death Stranding 2 before writing this preview. I can confidently say that it’s excellent, and I can’t wait to do it all again (and much more) when it releases next month," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the current Switch doesn't ask for a phone number for voice chat, a separate mobile device is still needed to talk with friends through the Nintendo Switch Online app. This will eventually get renamed to the Nintendo Switch app sometime this month and will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/">where you find Zelda Notes</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/">the enhanced Switch 2 Editions</a> of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, a report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/">GameChat including a couple of helpful accessibility features</a>: text-to-chat speech functionality and live chat translation. However, both were showcased in Japanese, so it's unknown officially what languages may be supported on the upcoming system.</p><p>Switch 2 is set to launch on June 5 for $450, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">preorders sold out</a> almost immediately. That said, Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-supply-should-be-ready-for-demand-in-us-says-nintendo-of-america-boss/1100-6531600/">Doug Bowser believes the company can meet demand for the console</a> throughout the rest of this year.</p>

            <p>Project Milo was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionhead-project-milo-existed-before-wed-even-heard-of-kinect">initially revealed alongside Microsoft's Kinect device all the way back in 2009</a>, and featured a young character named Milo who players could interact with. However, it never actually made it to release, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-project-milo-cancelled">the project was cancelled in 2010</a>.</p>
<p>So, what happened? Well, Peter Molyneux recently shared his side of the story during Nordic Game 2025 in Malmö, explaining how changing priorities led to the end of the project and how he didn't want to "prance around like a twat".</p>

<p>"I'll tell you exactly what happened," Molyneux said, as transcribed by Eurgamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/peter-molyneux-recalls-how-project-milo-the-kinect-game-with-revolutionary-promise-died-a-death">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Microsoft had [bought] us, we were owned by Microsoft, and they had...I'm going to say this, I might get in trouble...what I thought was a bit of a crazy idea. And that was to do gesture recognition as an input device, rather than a controller. They showed me this stuff, and Microsoft had this amazing research building. Incredible.</p>
<p>"It was run by this brilliant bloke called Alex Kipman. Makes me look boring and passionless – he had ten times more passion than I had. He had this demo of this device, and when he showed me this demo, it could see people's faces. He said, 'it can do voice recognition', and it had a massive field-of-view so it could see this whole room."</p>
<p>When Kipman first asked Molyneux his thoughts on the tech that would ultimately end up as the Kinect, the game developer replied:</p>
<p>"'Well, firstly' - when he did the demo, he was jumping all over the room - 'I'm a gamer, I don't want to play games standing up. That's the first thing. It doesn't appeal to me, I want to sit back, I want to smoke what I smoke, and I want to drink what I want to drink, and I don't want to prance around like a twat'."</p>
<p>Molyneux said he would go and instead create a demo of how he believed the technology should be used, with a more sedentary slant with a focus on feeling. For this, he took inspiration from his then seven-year-old son, Lucas.</p>
<p>"Anyone who's a parent will probably experience this: there was this moment where you realise you're <em>crafting</em>, inspiring, a human being," the developer said. "Wouldn't it be an incredible thing to create a game around that feeling… About inspiring, in Milo's case, a boy. That was contentious in itself, because of course, lots of people go to the dark side with that [idea]."</p>
<p>Staff at Molyneux's studio Lionhead subsequently started work on the demo, and began collaborating with a technology company on Project Milo's voice recognition.</p>
<p>"We had all sorts of experiences, like you could hand things to Milo in the game world and he would take them. They really worked well."</p>
<p>The team "cheated in a big way about how you could talk to Milo",  Molyneux said, adding he wanted to make sure that players would be able to relax on the couch at the end of a day (or, to be fair, in the middle of it), and "just experience things with this game character".</p>
<p>"Even though voice recognition now is almost a solved problem, back in those days we solved the problem by cheating," Molyneux explained. "So, when Milo asked you the player a question, we had set that question up to different points, so he knew what sort of answer he'd give."</p>
<p>The developer went on to explain some more about the behind the scenes of Project Milo, admitting it was unfortunate that at the same time as all of this was going on, Microsoft was also working on its Kinect device.</p>
<p>"And [Microsoft] realised that the device that Alex Kipman first showed off would cost $5k for consumers to buy. So they cost-reduced that device down to such a point, where the field-of-view… I think it was a minuscule field-of-view. In other words, it could only just see what's straight in front of you."</p>
<p>In the end, changing priorities at Microsoft, which wanted to focus on the Kinect, led to the end of Project Milo. Molyneux said the "death blow" which still "breaks his heart" today, "was that it was decided that Kinect shouldn't be a gaming device: it should be a party device. You should play a sports game with it, or dancing games with it."</p>
<p>Project Milo, then, "didn't fit into the Microsoft portfolio", and the whole thing was ultimately canned.</p>
<p>"No one ever saw the complete experience," Molyneux closed. "We didn't finish the experience. But it was a magical thing. What was so magical about it: it wasn't about heroes and aliens coming down, there wasn't this 'end of the world' narrative scenario.</p>
<p>"It was just experiencing what it's like to hang out with someone that loves you."</p>

<p>Eurogamer spoke to Molyneux last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">about his Masters of Albion project</a>. Masters of Albion will take place "in the land of Albion", and has - in the words of Katharine Castle - big Black and White energy, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">a more customisable bent that lets you design buildings, meals, armour and more</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch lineup mainly consists of existing games ported to the new console, with very few exceptions, and one of them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-will-run-at-4k60-with-hdr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST FUSION</a>.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity racing game series made by Munich-based developer Shin'en Multimedia is exclusive to Nintendo consoles. The first installment, FAST RACING LEAGUE, debuted on the Wii in May 2011. FAST RACING NEO then launched on the Wii U in 2015, and an enhanced version of that game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fast-rmx-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST RMX</a> debuted as a launch title for the Switch in March 2017.</p>
<p>FAST FUSION is also a launch title. However, this time around, it's a brand new installment with new features like Hyperjumps and Vehicle Fusion. As usual, it'll also be a technical showcase, and the studio has already shared that it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with High Dynamic Range support. Jack Merluzzi, the announcer known for his work on F-Zero GX, is returning from FAST RACING NEO.</p>
<p>We sent Shin'en Multimedia a few questions to learn more about their new game and discuss their experience with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><em><strong>When did you start working on your Nintendo Switch 2 game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We have been working since 2024 on the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Wow, that's not long at all. Were you really able to make FAST FUSION in just one year, or was it in development before?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The game wasn't in development before, but as we work on our own tools and engine and had done several FAST games before, we were able to speed up development a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>After some time with the new hardware, what was the most impressive&nbsp;new feature for you and why?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The new GPU features are, of course, most interesting to us from a developer's perspective. Having an HDR compatible display now makes quite a big difference in our game's look.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? How are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the new HD rumble is very impressive. We use it in many places in FAST FUSION and it intensifies the action quite a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What are the main improvements that players will notice in FAST FUSION over the previous installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>First of all, players will of course notice the much more detailed, alive and vibrant tracks, but the new core elements like Vehicle Fusion and Hyperjumps are what take Fast Fusion to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How will the Vehicle Fusion feature work?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You can use any vehicles you acquired in the game for Fusion (just by playing, we have no microtransactions). With Vehicle Fusion, you bring together two vehicles of your liking to create a hybrid of both. So you can, for instance, fuse a fast vehicle with low acceleration with a heavy vehicle that has fast acceleration. The new vehicle will combine the best of both worlds. Also, the looks of both vehicles will be merged into a totally new one.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Very interesting. Can't wait to try it. Thank you for your time!</strong></em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025 globally. Nintendo won't be providing pre-release review units and codes to the press, but look forward to our reviews of the new hardware and some of the launch games later in June.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0, which the developer says will mark the "grand beginning" of the gacha action RPG's second season.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date" rel="nofollow">April's Version 1.7</a>, Version 2.0 will arrive on June 6th across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available. It'll bring a new area to explore, new characters to add to your lineup, and more, just as you'd expect from a HoYoverse update.</p>

<p>First up, you'll be embarking on "an exhilarating new journey" that will take you to the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu". There, you'll discover new exploration gameplay mechanics, "further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.0-ju-fufu.jpg?itok=LkhdIlPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.0-ju-fufu.jpg?itok=lZik-r6k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 has three new fighters for you to add to your team.</figcaption></figure><p>The first of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0's three new characters is Grandmaster Yixuan, an S-rank agent who can ignore defense to deal huge damage, which can also scale with her attack power and max HP.</p>

<p>She's joined by fellow S-rank Agent Ju Fufu, a Yunkui Summit disciple who deals Physical and Fire damage and boosts her squad's critical damage with her Tiger's Roar buff.</p>

<p>Finally, rounding out the playable character roster for Version 2.0 is the A-rank Physical Defense Agent Pan Yinhu, a "kitchen-savvy panda" who brings some serious attitude to your team. S-rank Bangboo Belion will also be added to the game in this update.</p>

<p>They'll join Astra Yao and Caesar, two S-rank Agents who are getting reruns as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Version 2.0 banners. Not only that, but since this update marks the game's first anniversary, you'll be able to "choose one S-rank Agent and one S-rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free".</p>




<p>Of course, this update also introduces plenty of quality-of-life improvements like a new 3D map for navigation, new beacons that allow you to revive characters and restore HP, and other optimizations.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 launches across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a> on June 6th.</p>
