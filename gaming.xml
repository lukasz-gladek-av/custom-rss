			<p>Today is a momentous occasion for Bungie and Destiny fans, as the franchise is officially 10 years old. On September 9, 2014,<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/"> Bungie</a> released Destiny, a sci-fi MMO where players could become Guardians and explore the online universe. Just three years later, Destiny was closed down and replaced with Destiny 2, where the game was initially released as a pay-to-play game. However, it soon became free-to-play in 2019, where the game has received many expansions, such as Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and The Witch Queen, to name a few. The most recent expansion was called The Final Shape, which became the fuel to change the seasonal model. To celebrate the anniversary of Destiny as a franchise, players will be able to get nostalgic in-game armor and physical products and look at some art to revel in the nostalgia. Additionally, Bungie has provided details on Codename: Frontiers, the future of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Major changes are coming for Destiny 2's future. The game will receive two medium-sized expansions and four major free content updates annually. This change hopes to enhance the player experience by introducing a non-linear story, meaning players won't be forced into purchasing expansions if they don't want to. In addition, there will be improvements to the core game activities and the reward system.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will be able to see these changes that utilize the new model starting with Codename Apollo, a nonlinear character-driven adventure and the first edition of the new expansion model, set to release in the Summer of 2025.</p>
<p>To help keep the community informed, Bungie will release a Developer Insight Deep Dives series over the coming months. Bungie has also <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_10_anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a blog post</a> explaining Destiny's long history and an art exhibition in LA, New York City, and London. The exhibition entrance is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>In addition to this, players will be able to experience the nostalgia of Destiny by obtaining a new set of armor for each class, which is inspired by the original concept designs from Destiny. Players must go to the Tower in the Lost City in The Pale Heart to get hold of these armor sets.</p>
<p>For those who did buy The Final Shape, players can earn the Legend title in Destiny 2 by completing The Final Shape Legendary campaign, wearing the anniversary armor during specific activities, exploring the Pale Heart, and completing specific objectives. If you manage to earn the title before September 24, you'll be given early access through Bungie Rewards to purchase the new NERF LMTD Destiny 2 Ace of Spades Blaster before its official release on October 8.</p>
<p>While Destiny has been around for ten years, this new expansion model could see it last another 10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed-to-november.976029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bad Ridge Games and publisher V Publishing have announced that upcoming fantasy life sim&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a couple of months.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>was originally due to arrive on PC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date">on Wednesday</a>, but it's now set to arrive on November 6th instead, representing a delay of around two months. Time to dig out that old Shigeru Miyamoto quote, I suppose.</p>
<p>Bad Ridge's Daron Otis says that the delay has been put into effect in order to let the team ensure&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is "the best it can be on day one", which is a pretty difficult goal to argue with, all things considered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=I2K9pEUi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=AZ0z10Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's going to be a little longer before you can play&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Otis says that the team working on&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is a "small, passionate" one, and that although the team has worked "tirelessly" to create a world players will love to explore, there are still "key areas" that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>According to Otis, those key areas include "performance optimization, localization, and some of the systems" that power&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>. All of these features need to be given "more attention" prior to launch.</p>
<p>Extra development time will, according to a press release, allow&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s developers to fine-tune the game, improve its performance, and ensure it's "fully localized for players worldwide", which, again, is a pretty noble goal.</p>
<p>Otis concludes by saying that making&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s fans happy is "more of a priority than hitting a date", which is a sentiment I think a lot of major triple-A publishers could still learn from.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is, it's a fantasy life sim that casts you as a refugee from a continent torn apart by war. You must start again in an "immersive medieval fantasy world sandbox" that features plenty of opportunities to explore, trade, and do battle with its inhabitants.</p>
<p>After it launches, Bad Ridge has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-roadmap-post-launch">post-release roadmap in place</a> for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, and it's promising multiplayer, mod support, and family dynamics, plus lots more.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam on November 6th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game right here</a> if you want to keep up with it.</p>

            <p>
I recently moved to a suburban neighbourhood where there is lots of relatively "wild" parkland and a few raggedy patches of woodland. I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6">stupid listicles about Call Of Duty</a>. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2</a> - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The roots are everywhere, and unseen. I can trace their presence through the differing acoustics of the soil beneath, but I can't map them precisely. I never quite know whether there's one underfoot, at any given moment. According to my layman's understanding of tree physiology (there is probably a more precise term than "tree physiology"), roots drink up water and soil nutrients. Sounds harmless, but drinking is an open-ended practice. A root that drinks up water may surely drink up other fluids. Blood, for example, or tears. The liquefied substance of the human spirit. The direful drippings of bad dreams.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
I'm entertaining these fears because I've just been reading the blurb for Roots Devour. It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management experience and a card game in which you play a really awful eldritch tree, which is trying to become top Elder God of a forest full of equally awful creatures. This is to be achieved within 30 in-game days by spreading out your roots and "organs" (do trees have organs?), harvesting the blood of other organisms, and dealing with unspecified threats. You can also, seemingly, earn the devotion of wild-eyed human tribes or mastermind their fates from the shadows.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is presented as the act of spreading cards across a tabletop, which I like inasmuch as I'm now thinking about other card games as secret forests, hopefully not carnivorous ones. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">read more and watch a trailer on Steam</a> - I think there's full English localisation on the way. For a real-time spin on the idea of being a ravenously expanding morass of tendrils, sink your teeth into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrion">Carrion</a>.

This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so.” </p><p>Gerighty says that in the next “10 days or so” a patch will arrive for <em>Outlaws </em>that will tweak this early mission and hopefully make it less annoying. And he further explained that he and the team behind the game are open to tweaking later missions, too. </p><p>“If you tell me today that that’s a blocker for people enjoying the game, then we’re going to tweak the narrative context, right? We’ll have an announcement on the PA saying <em>[does pretend PA voice</em>] ‘Well, stormtroopers have gone down to Toshara and now we have the skeleton crew on site.’ The context will change, just so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible.”<br></p><p>Sounds good to me! I didn’t find the stealth in <em>Outlaws </em>to be horrible or a dealbreaker, but I’ve talked to plenty of people who are unable to move forward or enjoy the game because of some wonky and overly tough stealth sections. So hopefully this helps people stop failing and lets them enjoy the wonderful <em>Star Wars </em>vibes <em>Outlaws </em>offers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first thing you’ll need to know is that Doom is extremely tall, making him easier to hit than your standard player. He also has 500 HP and Shield and can’t use any items to heal himself. That being said, there are ways to regain health. The first is by killing other players, because you’re evil now. You can also break shield kegs or have a buddy throw chug splashes at you to heal up.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-recommend-id="image://77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom Luis contemplates his terrible new powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom Luis contemplates his terrible new powers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-recommend-id="image://77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom Luis contemplates his terrible new powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Doom has various powers to enjoy.

His secondary is a bit different, shooting out a straight beam that can be moved around as you fire it. He also has a move called Mystical Gigabomb, and as the name suggests, it’s a giant bomb that you can shoot towards enemies.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-recommend-id="image://7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Diving back down as Doom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Diving back down as Doom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-recommend-id="image://7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Diving back down as Doom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for his last few abilities, he can jump high up in the air and hover. While in the air, you can Dive Kick towards anyone near you. On top of that, Doom has the ultimate sprint.<br></p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to know is, if you die as Doom, you won’t be able to come back as him, <em>ever</em>. So be mindful of how aggressively you’re playing, because once Doom is gone, he’s gone. Make the most of your moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every game feels pretty close to their arcade equivalents,, though they obviously pop a bit more on modern screens capable of higher fidelity.<br></p><h2 id="h1654"><a id=""></a><strong>Modern classics</strong></h2><p>There are various small settings that can be tweaked/optimized in the <em>Arcade Classics</em> compilation, like the difficulty of your AI opponents, the base speed of the game, and even the starting stage on some occasions. Additionally, training mode can be entered from the game select screen, or when waiting for an online lobby, and showcases all the frame data one could possibly need, as well as a log of inputs.<br></p><p>In action, controls are pretty simplified and each fighting game has a single button, often on the left trigger, which lets you unleash hyper combos easily, kind of like modern controls in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>. This setting can be toggled in offline and casual play, and cannot be used in ranked, making mastery of the game less intimidating for novices while refraining from stepping on the toes of competitive players.. Speaking of, the fighting games also come with casual and ranked online matchmaking, though I had difficulty finding anyone to play online with during my preview period due to low player count. To complement the preservation and further propagation of these legendary titles, Capcom has even thrown in some very neat behind-the-scenes features.</p><p>For example, you can view the marquee of every title almost all the time from the menu, which displays the instructions that would’ve been printed onto the actual arcade cabinet, complete with the original diagrams of the joystick and face buttons that come with them. It’s a handy tool tip to have right in the menu, but for the most part it feels like a piece of history you get to carry with you, which extends to a ton of other features here, too. You can freely dip into a museum mode that features concept art and hundreds of music tracks across the seven games, like <em>MvC2</em>’s iconic character select song, individual character themes, as well as opening and ending songs, and you can even skim through all of it while waiting to connect to an online match. The most exciting bit is the scanned design documents that show some of the developer’s processes when making the games—considering how much is done digitally these days, and how secretive the games industry is, it’s astonishing to see handwritten-and-drawn notes and diagrams that lay out the mechanics and layout of the levels of some of these games, like a sequence on a moving vehicle in the port of <em>The Punisher</em> that remained mostly intact from its accompanying design doc.<br></p><h2 id="h1655"><a id=""></a><strong>An oldie gets its time in the spotlight</strong></h2><p>On that note, <em>The Punisher </em>is the significant outlier of the collection, since it isn’t a traditional fighting game like the other titles included. Instead, it’s a 2D beat-em-up and its presence here is a pretty big deal: <em>The Punisher </em>is a beloved classic game that never quite made a successful jump to consoles. There is a Sega Genesis port that is widely believed to be inferior to the original arcade version, which has finally now been faithfully ported for the first time ever in this collection .It is also the first game collaboration between Capcom and Marvel Comics, which eventually gave us the rest of the games in this collection (namely the acclaimed <em>Marvel vs. Capcom </em>series), so it’s a significant piece of gaming history, too. And it rips.<br></p><p>I don’t tend to play beat-em-ups (which are deceptively difficult games) often, but after playing through <em>The Punisher</em>,<em> </em>I can understand the hype behind it. The aesthetic of these arcade games has always felt much more in line with the original visions and interpretations of the comic book characters upon which they’re based, and <em>The Punisher </em>certainly has that going for itself. If you were looking for something that looked and felt like a <em>Punisher</em> comic, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better adaptation. Frank Castle <em>looks</em> like the version of him featured in early comics, and he and the game are as gratuitously violent as ever in alignment with their vision. As you wield axes and knives to cut down enemies, it’s refreshing to see them actually bleed, which is otherwise absent from most other beat-em-ups I played growing up, like the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em>series, but feels tonally pitch perfect here.</p><p>In terms of controls, <em>The Punisher</em> is pretty straightforward, but it also has some features that were advanced for its time. For example, Frank and Nick Fury (who’s the second playable character in co-op) don’t quite have a dash, but they do have a directional dodge roll that works along the X-and-Y axis. Upon grabbing an enemy, you can do any one of about three different techniques depending on your inputs, and they each can pick up screen-clearing grenades that saved my life on more than one occasion. When I felt backed into a corner, I could do a spinning leg sweep that worked as an effective parry and doubled as armor for a few seconds. The most stylistic addition comes by way of <em>The Punisher</em>’s firearms, which are only drawn when enemies with guns appear onstage. In these moments, <em>The Punisher </em>automatically locks onto enemies in your vision and lets you unload on them as the game transforms into a shooting gallery, and most of the action is accompanied by comic-accurate onomatopoeias. </p><p>I came away from this collection in awe of the historicity of it all and the bang-up job Capcom’s done preserving these seven titles. And I think that’s the ultimate goal of a project like the <em>Capcom Fighting Collection</em>, right? Yes, I’m obviously going to get mileage out of whooping people and being whooped in return as I take my fights online across the fighting game catalog featured here, but I’ve come away with something new and special and I now get to hold onto it in perpetuity. And now games like <em>The Punisher </em>get to live on outside of someone’s faint memories of playing it more than 30 years ago at an arcade. Now, someone who grew up playing and loving that game and others like it can feasibly share it with someone they love. That ought to be true for more games, and hopefully efforts like this <em>Arcade Classics </em>collection help ensure that eventually comes to pass. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Yu-Gi-Oh fans have been underserved when it comes to replaying some of the best games from the franchise's heyday, but that's all changing with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9PKCT42?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection</a>. What's most exciting about the upcoming compilation is that it includes Game Boy games that didn't release outside of Japan the first time around. Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection doesn't have a release date, and Konami hasn't revealed the full list of games, but from what we know so far, fans will want to keep this on their radar.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-season-1%E2%80%99s-mythic-rotation.975993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-is-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-season-1s-mythic-rotation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Season 1 of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a> starts tomorrow, which introduces a new Mythic+ season, Raiding and PvP, to engage in and try to bring up your rankings. This season is the first of the new expansion, meaning players will experience some new dungeons to join the game in a Mythic+ setting with Mythic affixes.</p>
<p>This also introduces Nerub-ar Palace on Normal and Heroic difficulty, with LFR getting access to Wing 1 of the raid. For the first week, players will only get to participate in Mythic 0 dungeons, which helps them prepare for the more challenging dungeons ahead. All Mythic+ dungeon difficulties will be available from September 17 onwards.</p>
<p>For those who want to know what to expect from the upcoming season, this guide will explain what Mythic+ dungeons you'll be seeing in the Mythic+ pool, as well as what affixes you'll be coming up against as you climb the Mythic+ rankings.</p>
<h2>What Mythic+ Dungeons Are There in The War Within Season 1?</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24137817/the-war-within-season-1-begins-september-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight new Mythic+ dungeons</a> for players to experience this season, four of which are from The War Within. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ara-Kara, City of Echoes</li>
<li>City of Threads</li>
<li>The Stonevault</li>
<li>The Dawnbreaker</li>
<li>Mists of Tirna Scithe (Shadowlands)</li>
<li>The Necrotic Wake (Shadowlands)</li>
<li>Siege of Boralus (Battle for Azeroth)</li>
<li>Grim Batol (Cataclysm)</li>
</ul>
<p>By participating in Mythic+ dungeons and earning Rating, you can unlock achievements, titles, and a mount for reaching a certain number of Rating.</p>
<p>You can work towards these seasonal rewards in Mythic+ Season 1 of The War Within.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keystone Explorer</strong>: Complete a Mythic+ Dungeon within the time limit during The War Within Season One.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Conqueror: </strong>Attain a mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during The War Within Season One—reward: The Tempered title.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Master</strong>: Attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during The War Within Season One—reward: Diamond Mechsuit mount.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Hero:&nbsp;</strong>Attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2500 during The War Within Season One—reward: Luminous Nerubian Catalyst Stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you end The War Within Season 1 with a Mythic+ Rating in the top 0.1% of all players in your region, you'll earn the Tempered Hero title.</p>
<h2>Keystone Affixes in The War Within Season 1</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Keystone Affixes are certain attacks or debuffs that provide an extra challenge to the Mythic+ dungeon. The new affixes will be seen as Mythic+ Keystone level 2, where players will see one of the Xal'atath-specific affixes, which are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Ascendant</strong>: Every minute, Xal'atath will summon 10 Orbs of Ascendance that cast Cosmic Ascension. Should the casts go off, the orbs will buff nearby mobs with +20% movement speed and Haste per orb. However, players are able to stop the cast via interruptions, displacement, crowd control, and purging them, which will instead give players a 2% movement speed and Haste buff per orb, which can stack up to a maximum of 20% movement speed and Haste per event.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Voidbound:&nbsp;</strong>While players are in combat, Xal'atath will summon a Void Emissary, who buffs nearby enemies with Dark Prayer. This will reduce the damage taken by 10% every three seconds, with the effect stacking. Once players have defeated the Void Emissary, players will be able to get a +20% ability cooldown rate and a +10% Critical Strike increase that lasts for 20 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Oblivion</strong>: While players are in combat, Xal'atath manifests crystals from the void that can either be absorbed by enemies or the players. Absorbing the crystals before they collide with enemies is advised, as it allows players to gain Void Essence, increasing Mastery and Leech. If the crystals hit the enemies, they will gain a +10% damage reduction per crystal.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Devour</strong>: Every so often, Xal'atath casts a Void Rift shield on all five players that can either be removed by healing or dispelling it. If you fail to remove the shield, it will heal nearby mobs for 10% of their health. Removing a shield will grant a stack of Lingering Void, which grants players +2% health and 4% Critical Strike.</p>
<p>Past Keystone Level 4, players will see Tyrannical or Fortified become active, with the affixes alternating each week. Tyrannical increases Dungeon bosses' health by 30% and damage by 15%. Fortified means non-boss enemies have 20% more health, and their damage increases by up to 20%.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 7, a new affix named Challenger's Peril becomes active. 15 seconds is subtracted from the dungeon timer each time a player dies instead of the usual 5-second subtraction.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 10, Fortified and Tyrannical become active at the same time. This means if you were seeing Tyrannical in one week, you might see Fortified instead once you reach Level 10.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 12, Xalatath's Bargain affixes are replaced with Xal'atath's Guile. This gives enemies a 20% increase in their health and damage, with players no longer receiving the buffs from the Bargain affixes.</p>
<p>This Mythic+ season is shaping up to be very difficult, with players having to be more careful in who they choose to create a Mythic+ team.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-switching-to-two-expansions-and-four-free-updates-per-year.975990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced radical changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansions and updates will be released, and the studio is moving away from its yearly release model going forward.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article titled "New Frontiers"</a>, Bungie marks the tenth anniversary of the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>franchise by discussing what's next for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. The studio said that it "closed a door" with recent expansion&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, and that it's now looking to open "a new one, a weird one, an exciting one".</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>will now get two "medium"-sized expansions per year, as well as four major free updates. The expansions will be paid, but the updates will be available for all players at no cost.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-expansions-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=hYS1nTeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-expansions-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=G7gdNdUO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>expansion "closed a door" for Bungie.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Destiny 2</em>'s new expansions will "depart from the one-shot campaign structure" for which the game's expansions have become known, and will instead experiment with uncharted territory for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. This could include "exploration experiences", Metroidvania structures, or even "roguelikes or survival shooters".</p>
<p>Additionally, rather than Episodes,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>will now get four updates per year. Expansions will launch alongside major updates at the start of Seasons, and a second update will follow three months after that, adding content like Strikes, new modes, and new gear.</p>
<p>This new modernization process begins with the expansion currently titled&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo</em>, which is set to launch next summer. Bungie describes this expansion as a "nonlinear character-driven adventure".</p>
<p>In essence, whereas the story in previous expansions was an "A to B to C to D" affair, this one will offer more choice, allowing you to explore locations and narrative elements at your own discretion (although the ones you don't pick will still be available later).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-codename-apollo.jpg?itok=wbU0DyHS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-codename-apollo.jpg?itok=6GmermET 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't quite know what&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo&nbsp;</em>is yet, but it'll be nonlinear.</figcaption></figure><p>These changes come after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">sweeping layoffs at Bungie</a>, which CEO Pete Parsons called part of a "new path" for the studio. It's also worth noting that the game's most recent major expansion,&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-officially-delayed-to-deliver-even-bigger-and-bolder">was delayed by several months</a>, which may be relevant in Bungie's decision to shift to smaller expansions.</p>
<p>We'll likely get to find out more about Bungie's plans for&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on this as and when we get it.</p>

Another time it could be an elephant backpack that can suck up liquid and then spawn platforms in midair. And in Downsize Surprise, it’s a mouse suit that lets you shrink down all teeny.<br></p><p>Thing is, in any other platform game that did this, you’d just shrink down for the level and then explore things in your miniature mode. But in <em>Astro Bot</em>’s level, the entire thing can be played at either size, requiring a combination of the two to complete, and you can switch form at any time you like.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate how complex that is from a level design perspective. Ordinarily, such a gimmick would allow the player to step through a portal, or trigger a change, at predetermined points. To let me, buffoon that I am, just hammer the size change button as often as I want to see what happens—that’s phenomenal. And to make it even better, the transformation feels <em>utterly magical</em>.</p><p>Like in those excellent scenes in the <em>Ant-Man</em> movies when Scott Lang has got the hang of the suit, hitting the button in mid-action and shrinking or growing accordingly never gets old. That flowerbed you were just stomping over is now an obstacle course of leaves and petals to explore. The little wooden trunk you stepped on is now a tunnel you can run through with pick-ups to collect. And then, because you can’t resist the idea, you press the grow button while you’re in the tunnel, and—YES!—it bursts apart and reveals even more goodies to pick up.</p><p>You use the ability in a few other ways I don’t want to mention, because finding them is so much of the joy. I’m more here today to celebrate the absolute beauty of how it’s delivered.</p><figure id="" data-id="a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-recommend-id="image://a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-recommend-id="image://a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s no question at all that <em>Astro Bot</em> leaves this mechanic under-explored. It’s no wonder, given that moments later you’re in Go Go Archipelago with a robo-monkey helping you throw stones at baddies and climb banana-grips up walls to reach twirly-whirly bars that fling you into the sky. If anything, the nonchalance with which Team Asobi utilizes a shrink/grow mechanic better than any game before it is all the more astonishing. “Yeah, we’ve perfected that, but we’re busy and have a great idea about balloons...”<br></p><p>Which brings me back to my provocative opening thesis. Nintendo, you’re being called out here.</p><p>Obviously there’s a new 3D <em>Mario</em> in development, perhaps intended to be released as a launch title for the Switch’s follow-up console next March. It’s been an astonishing seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> was released, and over three years since the prototype for a glorious open-world future, <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, was tucked in with the Switch release of <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>. So it’s probably too late for me to use my considerable influence to command Nintendo over what to include in the next 3D entry. But in the game after that, Nintendo, you need to return to the concept of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/k2oAwTAzmnU?si=PgPU7z1cLb0Sryen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/k2oAwTAzmnU?si=PgPU7z1cLb0Sryen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>'s Giant Land</a></span>, but in 3D, and it needs to be constantly innovating on the concept throughout. Got it? Great.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-recommend-id="image://9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-recommend-id="image://9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If nothing else, let this missive implore you to play <em>Astro Bot</em>. I was fairly horrified when I saw that Sony is pricing it the same as a AAA 50 hour game, because cutesy 3D platformers are a hard sell at $60. And while I still believe it’d sell far more than twice as many copies at half the price, I can also assure you that the sheer concentrated joy within out-values any number of looter shooters or zombie-fests.<br></p><p>A single level has me thinking Nintendo developers might be wriggling uncomfortably in their seats, realizing that there’s finally some competition out there, another developer capable of cutting a slice from their enormous, delicious pie.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-2-codename-frontiers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-reveals-%E2%80%98codename-frontiers%E2%80%99-expansions-for-destiny-2.975981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-2-codename-frontiers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie has posted a roadmap outlining something called ‘Codename Frontiers’, an ambitious expansion plan for Destiny 2. It arrives on the tenth anniversary of Destiny, which was released in 2014 to an overwhelmingly positive reception. On June 4, Bungie released The Final Shape for Destiny 2, but it has now been revealed that it wasn’t ever set to mark the end of the game.</p>



<p>In the words of the team, ‘We closed a door with The Final Shape, but we are opening a new one, a weird one, an exciting one.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-apollo-and-behemoth">Apollo and Behemoth</h2>



<p>Bungie has revealed that in the summer of 2025, ‘Codename Apollo’ will be released in Destiny 2. It’ll be followed up in the winter by Codename Behemoth, another super-sized expansion. Outside of these expansions, players will pick up four major updates per year <strong>for free</strong> in Destiny 2.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Each expansion under the Codename Frontiers banner will accommodate two rewards passes, and the roadmap itself stretches to Spring 2026. Each season (Apollo and Behemoth) will be comprised of new stories, locations, missions, gear, and raids – amongst other things. </p>



<p>Speaking on the new plans, Bungie’s Tyson Green, the Game Director working on Destiny 2, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that it has become too rigid. Expansions have started to feel too formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value. Seasons and Episodes keep getting bigger but can still feel like you are just going through the motions.</p>



<p>We believe it’s time for Destiny to change and evolve, and that our community wants this game to grow and innovate too. And to do that, we need to start breaking some of the molds.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Bungie is also working on the approachability mechanics in Destiny 2, making it much more accessible to newcomers who might otherwise be put off by the game’s complexities.</p>



<p>Everything will kick off with Codename Apollo, which has been labelled a ‘<strong>nonlinear character-driven adventure</strong>.’</p>



<p>It’s a bold play by Bungie, and it looks solid on the surface – it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>

The celebrations kick off with a wardrobe raid, as players can grab a set of armor for each class inspired by the original concept armor pieces for Destiny. These were some of the first Destiny armor sets ever seen publicly, and they can be obtained when exploring the surroundings of the old Tower in The Pale Heart.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363997"></a><figcaption>Detiny 2014 armor sets are the new black.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363998,1300-4363999" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg"></figure><p>The other big celebratory pursuit will be a new selection of tasks that can be completed to earn the Legend title and seal. Some of the challenges involve completing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a> campaign on Legend difficulty, but if you've already done that, that task will automatically be checked off of your to-do list. There's one very good reason to chase after the Legend title, as earning it before Episode: Echoes ends will give players an early-access opportunity to purchase the Nerf version of the Ace of Spades hand cannon replica before its official launch in October. The offer includes a special Ace of Spades Nerf in-game weapon ornament that will also be available for purchase in the in-game store when Episode: Revenant launches.</p><p>Bungie also teased the return of a fan-favorite Exotic sniper rifle, Icebreaker, in an upcoming Dungeon release. The original Icebreaker was nasty to be on the receiving end of, as it turned anyone hit by its rounds into a walking bomb, but it had an interesting quirk as well. Icebreaker featured self-replenishing ammunition, and when fully upgraded, it had a chance to return ammo directly to the magazine on a successful hit. While it couldn't be reloaded like a standard weapon could, it was still cool to have a sniper rifle with essentially infinite ammo available.</p><p>Bungie says it has more Anniversary tributes to Destiny yet to reveal, and beyond the milestone celebrations, the studio also laid out its plans for Year 11 and beyond of Destiny 2, including four major updates every year, two smaller expansions twice a year, and the start of the next multi-year story saga in Codename: Apollo.</p>

		<p>Without actually saying it exists, Sony have announced that the PS5 Pro will be revealed tomorrow, September 10th at 8:00am PT / 4:00pm BST. What the have announced is a “technical presentation” for the PlayStation 5, and as we already know what is inside the PS5&nbsp; there’s only one thing this could be.</p>
<p>“The 9-minute Technical Presentation will focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology”, explains the PS Blog. That’s it, that’s all we’re getting from Sony even though they already<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/06/ps5-pro-first-official-image-sony/"> leaked the console design</a> themselves.&nbsp; The announcement was also leaked, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/ps5-pro-design-and-announcement-plans-leaked/">we knew this was coming</a> in the first half of September.</p>



<p>As for what is inside the upgraded console, here’s what has leaked/rumoured so far:</p>
<p>he PS5 Pro will follow in the footsteps of the PS4 Pro in offering a general spec bump when compared to the base PS5, aiming to give a general uplift to both performance and game fidelity. There will be a 28% boost in system memory speed, a 10% increase in CPU speed, and then a huge jump in GPU speed by some 45% with custom hardware dedicated to image upscaling.</p>

<p>On the CPU side of things, this will be achieved with a High CPU Frequency Mode which allows it to hit 3.85Ghz, though this will be done by way of the dynamic power management that balances CPU and GPU power to reach the same power consumption. When in higher CPU modes, the GPU will be downclocked by 1.5%.</p>
<p>The system memory will jump from 448 GB/s to 576GB/s throughput, though newer memory types could see that figure jump further. Faster memory can have a big impact on the GPU performance, though it may be a bit disappointing that there’s no increase in memory from 16GB, which could potentially constrain the use of some more advanced ray tracing and other techniques.</p>
<p>There’s also a higher clock speed for the audio processing, which will allow for more complex reverbs to be processed with 35% more performance.</p>
<p>What does that all mean to the layman? Slightly better puddles? Nicer lighting? Something tangible worth buying a new console for which will no doubt cost even more than a standard PS5? We shall have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The stream will be broadcast in English on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/PlayStation">PlayStation YouTube channel</a> September 10yh at 8:00am PT / 11:00am ET / 4:00pm BST.</p>
<p><em>Source:&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/">PS Blog</a></em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-reveal-could-be-imminent-as-technical-presentation-announced.975933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-technical-presentation-ps5-pro-possible-reveal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a PS5 "Technical Presentation" hosted by none other than lead PS5 architect Mark Cerny, and it's scheduled to air tomorrow.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony says that the presentation will take place tomorrow at 8am Pacific (that's around 11am Eastern and about 4pm BST). You'll be able to watch the show via the official PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2Y8dQb0S6DtpxNgAKoJKA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment communications director Sid Shuman says the presentation will last around nine minutes, and that it'll "focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology". While the company is cagey regarding further details, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-technical-presentation-banner.jpg?itok=MMT7PCQ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-technical-presentation-banner.jpg?itok=eXAgKjUw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big things could be coming for PlayStation.</figcaption></figure><p>Within the last few weeks, the rumor mill has been spinning particularly fast concerning a potential upcoming reveal of the PS5 Pro, which has been mooted for some time now.</p>
<p>In late August, noted leaker Bilibil-kun, via <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" rel="noopener" target="_blank">French platform Dealabs</a>, supposedly revealed a sketch of the PS5 Pro, which showed a console that looks pretty similar to the current Slim model of the machine, only with some extra detailing and ports.</p>
<p>There was, of course, also the supposed PS5 Pro spec leak in March, behind which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN put its weight</a>, and just a couple of days ago, the ever-reliable Wario64 <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1831772340218425426" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that the PS5 Pro's design appears to be visible in a new PlayStation image celebrating the brand's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>All told, it's looking pretty likely that we're going to get some kind of PS5 Pro reveal during tomorrow's showcase, although obviously, we can't confirm that with any degree of certainty until the presentation itself has taken place.</p>

<p>Given that this year does indeed mark PlayStation's 30th birthday, it would seem a rather appropriate year to announce the PS5 Pro, and doing so would certainly inject a little faith into a brand that has arguably been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">struggling a little</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">recent times</a> (<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>notwithstanding).</p>
<p>In any case, we'll find out exactly what Sony is planning to announce tomorrow at 11am Eastern, so join us then for all the announcements from the Technical Presentation as soon as we get them.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/boku-no-natsuyasumi-ps1-playstation-summer-vacation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-underlying-inescapable-tension-of-boku-no-natsuyasumi.975930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/boku-no-natsuyasumi-ps1-playstation-summer-vacation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello. I am here to apologise. For years, dating back to the first time I wrote about it on the Old Site (in 2014!), I have been describing the <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi </em>series as variations of "relaxing", and even "chill". If you have ever played the games based on those recommendations, I would like to apologise for doing you dirty.</p><p>Sure, the games <em>look </em>chill. Their back-of-the-box summary certainly fits the bill. In each you play a kid on summer vacation, free to roam the countryside doing all kinds of fun kid stuff. Maybe you do some fishing, maybe you go for a swim, maybe you battle some bugs–you're a kid, you don't have a care in the world! Video games couldn't be any more relaxing!</p><p><strong>WRONG</strong>. As I have found<a href="https://aftermath.site/it-is-time-to-play-boku-no-natsuyasumi-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> after finally playing one to completion instead of just wildly dabbling</a>, this is a series defined by tension. No matter what you want to do, how leisurely your pursuits may appear, you are never really free to "chill" in <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>. You are simply performing tasks inside the brief window between one school year and the next, and all the while the latter is hurtling toward you as grimly and inevitably as Terminus in <em>Majora's Mask</em>.</p><p>There is no <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi </em>without a calendar, and the way you're methodically marched through it, one pastime to the next, one day at a time. It doesn't matter how hard you relax, or even what you do with the time given to you, because once you arrive at your summer home and the game begins, you've got 30 days. After that, it's all over.</p><p>This broad structure leads, as Tim has covered so well in his sprawling series on the game, to an urge to optimise your vacation. When the first game provides multiple endings based on the choices you make, and some activities open up only if you've performed certain actions at certain times, the stage is set for players to try to earn the "best" version of a holiday, one that creates the most lasting and consequential memories possible.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="action button reviews boku no natsuyasumi" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/779coR-XPTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That's not really a holiday, is it? Or even relaxing. It's just more work. You get up in the morning, you get dressed, do some stuff on a schedule, get rewards for it then go to bed. Rise and shine, rinse and repeat, do it all over again. Please note I'm not criticising the games here; this is the most relatable thing about them! We all know as we get older that a weekend isn't really a full weekend, and a vacation isn't really a whole vacation, because for every day of recreation there's an equal and opposite reaction: a day of dread.</p><p>A weekend isn't 2.5 days of fun. It's a Friday night, a whole day on Saturday to do stuff then a whole other day of laundry, washing dishes, recovering from Saturday and just generally wincing at the realisation that you're closer to going back to work than you are to Friday night. Same goes for vacations, and that's how I end up playing <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>, and I hate it.</p><p>In the spirit of <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi's</em> childhood reminiscence, I remember being a kid and feeling the same way about summer holidays. The first week or two would pass in a blur of delirium, freedom and escape, but as the heat dragged on and the days on the calendar whirred by, things would take on a different shape. Parties and beach trips gave way to trips to buy new school shoes, and whenever a holiday season passed its midway point I'd start to feel the weight of the upcoming school year resting a little heavier on my shoulders each day.</p><p>Maybe if <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em> were some sprawling sandbox, one taking place in a land free of day or date, it'd feel different. But it very much <em>does </em>take note of day and date, that's the whole point of the series. Your vacation is for a strictly limited time, so make the most of it!</p><p>I'll allow that some of this dread might be down to me, someone who can only enjoy a vacation for a certain amount of time before the threat of future work outmuscles my enjoyment of the present. But I also think much of it is intentional, for both game design and cultural reasons, and that as a result a series renowned as being "chill" actually has one of the most foreboding and inescapable boss fights of all time: going back to school.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back to School </a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

The crunch of red and yellow leaves as you step out into the rapidly-dimming daylight? Me neither. Climate change has ruined everything, and fall doesn’t start until November now. But! School is nonetheless back in session, so it’s time for Aftermath’s second-ever theme week. We hope you’ll join us for the festivities.</p><p>Back To School Week, the second of what he hope will become seasonal theme weeks following <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/inside-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside Baseball Week earlier this year</a>, is partially about school as it’s depicted in games – I mean, who doesn’t love <em>Persona </em>– but on top of that, we’re expanding the scope to include growth and education more generally, as well as ideas like nostalgia, youth, and hard lessons learned by companies and game developers alike. It’s been <a href="https://aftermath.site/axis-studios-collapse-closed-layoffs-vfx-animation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year of sobering realizations for everyone</a> in the video game industry, and we want to provide an unflinching look into how that’s impacted the people responsible for the games and services you love. But also, Chris is really excited to show people all the cool school/office/diary-worthy pens he’s been testing out, so we’re gonna do that too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve got tons of stories planned, and you’ll be able to find them all <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Back To School Week also ties into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our subscriber goals for this year</a>. In short, we’re a worker-owned, <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reader-supported</a> operation. We despise the idea of greedy executives and out-of-touch bosses turning what we’ve created into another <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enshittified shell</a> of a once-good website, and we’ve decided to avoid that at all costs. So far, readers’ contributions have allowed us to start running freelance pieces – some <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damn</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ones</a>, we think – and lay the groundwork for a merch store, which will be open for business very soon. We are immensely thankful. A little over a year ago, we were disparately roving writers, scattered to the winds by cruel circumstance. Now we’re all able to work together again, and we have a functional business that we own. It remains absolutely surreal to think about. We couldn’t have done any of this without our readers. We owe you the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But though your support has transformed this Little Site That Could into a Little Site That Can And Is Doing Some Really Cool Shit, we still dream of accomplishing even more: turning Aftermath into a full-time job for everyone on staff, bringing aboard another person or two, launching another podcast, and of course, throwing a big party to which you will all be invited.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re not already a subscriber, consider <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sending a few bucks our way</a> so that you, too, can read as many articles as you want, comment on them, and join our Discord community (which absolutely rules, by the way). We also have <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tip jar</a> where you can donate any amount you want, if that’s more your speed. Consider it tuition to ensure that the beautiful institution of Aftermath University remains alive and thriving. If you kick in enough, we might even name a hall after you.*</p><p>*A hallway, in one of our apartments</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The soundtrack itself consists of five tracks, one for each of the expansion’s bosses. In total the soundtrack is less than thirty minutes, but each track is an incredible accomplishment on the part of composers Nobuyoshi Suzuki, Tsukasa Saitoh, and Yuka Kitamura. </p><p>Like I said, the complete soundtrack isn’t very long, but if you could only listen to one track from the album I would highly recommend Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower, which accompanies one of the most climactic moments in the DLC. The surprise release of <em>The Old Hunters</em> soundtrack could be related to the PlayStation 30th anniversary celebrations, which the company noted in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official blog post</a></span> would include the release of game soundtracks on Spotify.</p><p>September has already been a great month for <em>Bloodborne </em>fans as we’ve gotten not one but two tiny acknowledgments of the game from Sony.

Throughout the newly released PS5 platformer,<em> </em>you’ll collect robots modeled after iconic PlayStation characters, and that includes one cute bot that bears a striking resemblance to <em>Bloodborne</em>’s Hunter. Of course, none of this is a remaster, remake, or PC port of the game, but <em>Bloodborne </em>fans will take what we can get at this point.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Could the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro finally be revealed on Tuesday? Sony <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1833158510030516386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced that it will be hosting</a> a “PlayStation 5 Technical Presentation” on Tuesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The presentation, which will be hosted by Mark Cerny, will start at 11am ET/8am PT/4pm BST. It’ll also run at just nine minutes in length.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Sony didn’t say what the presentation is for, all signs are pointing to the PS5 Pro being revealed. Reports have continued that it would be revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some point in September</a> with a release for the 2024 Holiday season. Just last week the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-will-have-a-similar-design-to-the-slim-models-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">design of the system was leaked</a>, and the system <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also teased</a> in PlayStation’s own advertising.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first to report of the console’s existence</a> back in March 2023.</p>



<p>As far as what the PS5 Pro will feature, various specs have been leaked and rumored over the last few months. According to the rumors, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console will have an identical CPU</a> to the PS5 but with a “High CPU Frequency Mode” to boost performance along with a CPU that offers 45% faster rendering than the current PS5.</p>

                <p>Since its official launch in 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/six-roblox-horror-games-to-try-out-this-halloween/2900-4416/" data-ref-id="2900-4416">Roblox</a> has amassed 79.5 million daily active users around the world. And in 2023, the Roblox Corporation revealed its grand ambition to increase that number to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-corp-eyeing-1-billion-daily-players/1100-6516723/" data-ref-id="1100-6516723">1 billion daily active users</a>. At this year's Roblox Developers Conference, the company announced some new plans to reach that goal, including a partnership between Roblox and Shopify as well as revamped revenue-sharing plans for developers who make premium experiences for the game creation platform.</p><p>Via <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Roblox site</a>, the company's deal with Shopify is part of a broader push to allow creators to sell their own physical merchandise within the experiences that they make for Roblox. Essentially, this means players won't have to leave Roblox if they want to buy something from one of their favorite creators. The Roblox Corporation notes that there will also be integrated support for other e-commerce platforms alongside Shopify. These features will be added in early 2025, but a few select creators may participate in the pilot program later this year.</p><p>The Roblox Corporation is also adding higher revenue sharing plans for creators who make premium experiences for Roblox on desktop. Experiences charging $10, $30, and $50 will respectively earn 50%, 60%, and 70% of the revenue for their creators beginning later this year. Support for games/experiences created for other platforms will happen at some point down the line.</p><p>Additionally, Roblox Corporation has signaled that it is working towards giving creators the tools and support they need to make "a high-performance, 100-player open-world, sports or battle royale-type game on Roblox." While Roblox co-creator David Baszucki appeared to concede that the platform can't currently support that, he also said "we won’t stop until this is possible."</p><p>Some of the other new features include Roblox Party, which allows friends to play the same games together. Roblox is also partnering with music distributer DistroKid to bring its catalog of music to the platform. There will be a new features called What's Playing and Music Charts. The former allows users to identify any piece of music playing in Roblox, while the latter will host separate charts for game/experience music and songs. Music Charts is expected to launch on Roblox early next year.</p>

                <p>Sony has announced that it will be airing a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Technical Presentation</a> on Tuesday, September 10, at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET. The stream will last for approximately nine minutes and can be watched on PlayStation's official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PlayStation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>Over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, senior director of communications Sid Shuman said, "Join us for a streamed presentation hosted by Mark Cerny, Lead Architect of the PS5 console. The nine-minute Technical Presentation will focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology."</p><p>While Shuman doesn't outright say that Sony will reveal the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">long-rumored PS5 Pro</a>, it's hard to imagine a better time to do so than in this technical presentation. Earlier this month, images of the alleged <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Pro design was leaked</a>, and then last week, Sony may have revealed the design itself through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-sony-just-revealed-the-ps5-pro-design/1100-6526310/" data-ref-id="1100-6526310">PlayStation's 30th anniversary imagery</a>.</p><p>It's currently unknown how much a PS5 Pro would be, but some analysts predict that it could be $650. Reportedly, developers who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">release games on or after September 16</a> also need to make their games compatible with PS5 Pro. The console is reportedly codenamed Trinity, and will feature a more powerful GPU and CPU.</p>

            <p>Sony has announced a PlayStation 5 technical presentation.</p>
<p>The presentation is set to last for nine minutes, and will be hosted by Mark Cerny. Cerny is the PlayStation 5's lead architect.</p>
<p>Further details are still slim, with <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/">Sony</a> merely stating the presentation will "focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology".</p>

<p>Will we finally get a look at the long-rumoured PS5 Pro model? Sony's official 30th anniversary artwork, which the company shared towards the end of last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">appeared to tease the next version of its PS5 console</a>. Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-design-reportedly-leaks">earlier leak pointed to a September PS5 Pro reveal</a>… watch this space!</p>
