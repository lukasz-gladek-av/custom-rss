            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/theres-a-pokemon-day-pokemon-presents-stream-happening-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s Pokémon Day on 27th February, and to mark the annual celebration, The Pokémon Company will have a Pokémon Present video.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Presents video will go live at 2PM UK time – <span dir="auto">6:00AM PST / 10:00 PM SGT – on that date.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="February 27 is Pokémon Day!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8gkKHR512M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s as far as The Pokémon Company has gone in revealing what will be shown, but we can absolutely make some educated guesses.</p>
<p>Top billing will surely go to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-for-2025/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the next big console game in the series that was announced at Pokémon Day last year with a 2025 target. An offshoot to the main series, just like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> was, this game takes us to the high tech new city of Lumiose City, where the world is being reshaped as part of an “urban redevelopment plan” to accommodate people and Pokémon together. We’re keen to see some meaningful gameplay from this one, and perhaps get a release date?</p>

<p>Beyond that we can expect plenty of updates on mobile and live service games. That will surely include the perennial Pokémon Go, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/12/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-launches-december-17th/">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, Pokémon Masters EX, Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Cafe ReMix and the slumbersome Pokémon Sleep.</p>
<p>But will there be any surprises? We’re in a bit of a lull for the franchise as a whole, as Arceus and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> both launched in 2022, the latter having DLC expansions through 2023. We know that Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming this year, but they might see fit to tease the next mainline game for 2026, perhaps?</p>
<p>If they did do that, we could be sure that these games will be cross-gen at the least. There’s pretty much no chance of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2</a> exclusive game coming within the first couple years of that console’s life – Sword and Shield was over two years after the Switch launched, to have a large enough audience, so expect the next mainline Pokémon game to want to tap into the huge playerbase that might not yet have upgraded. Additionally, there surely won’t be any Switch 2 chatter before the console’s big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">Nintendo Direct presentation on 2nd April</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two-now-has-a-release-date-in-the-us-and-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>On HBO and Sky, respectively</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've known that HBO's Last Of Us adaptation was getting a second season <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-getting-a-second-season">since 2023</a>, but now it has a release date. The first episode will air in the US on April 13th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Season two is set five years after the first series, and is due to partially cover the events of the second game, The Last Of Us: Part Two. That's "partially" because the show's creators have suggested it will take several seasons to tell that story in full.
</p>
<p>UK viewers will be able to begin season two the day after its US broadcast when the first episode is shown on Sky and streaming service NOW on Monday, April 14th.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us: Part Two</a> is also due to arrive on PC in lightly remastered form on April 3rd. It'll be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">via Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>The first season of HBO's adaptation was critically acclaimed, and became the first video game adaptation to be nominated for several awards, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">such as the Emmy's</a>. It stuck closely to the plot of the original game, with a few exceptions.
</p>
<p>I loved showrunner Craig Mazin's previous prestige series Chernobyl, but I confess I have very little appetite to watch The Last Of Us. It's a grim tale, and while that's arguably offset by the satisfaction of the interactions in the game, I can't imagine passively watching it without becoming deeply depressed. This is not a criticism of the show, mind you, merely an admission that I'm a softhearted babyman. I'll be watching old-fashioned cosy crime show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26591110/">Elsbeth</a> instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The live-action Street Fighter film now has a new director: Kitao Sakurai.</p>
<p>Capcom is "deeply involved with the adaptation" reports <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">still set to release on 20th March 2026</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese-American filmmaker most recently directed Netflix film Bad Trip starring comedian Eric André. Sakurai also wrote, directed and exec produced The Eric André Show.</p>

<p>Sakurai also isn't a stranger to video game adaptations, having directed several episodes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> TV show. He was also exec producer on the second season of Netflix show Beef, and directed several episodes of forthcoming Amazon series Butterfly.</p>
<p>Legendary will co-develop and co-produce the film alongside Capcom.</p>
<p>A previous incarnation of the film was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-street-fighter-movie-gets-the-directors-behind-horror-film-talk-to-me">set to be helmed by Australian twin filmmakers and YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou</a>, known for the horror film Talk to Me. Last June the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-loses-talk-to-me-filmmakers-1235924842/">pair left the project</a> with scheduling partly to blame.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film, though Capcom's involvement will hopefully ensure its authenticity. I'm sure we can expect the likes of Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li to feature.</p>
<p>Of course, it's by no means the first Street Fighter film adaptation, following the infamous 1994 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter film will be up against its traditional rival, Mortal Kombat.</p>

		<p>Indie psychological horror hit Mouthwashing is coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch in 2025, developer Wrong Organ and publisher CR Channel have announced. The game will have both a digital and physical release.</p>
<p>Mouthwashing released in September last year for PC, the game immediately getting plenty of attention for its dark narrative, in which five crew members of The Pony Express deal with dwindling resources and extreme isolation, descending into madness that’s accentuated by the retro PSX visual style.</p>


<p>The game has just passed the 500,000 sales mark on PC, with the team writing that this “honestly feels more surreal than any bizzaro psychosis.” They continue, “Everyone, you truly are incredible and we’re extremely grateful to you for taking a part in this painful journey and on behalf of everyone here both at Wrong Organ and CR Channel we want to say thank you!”</p>
<p>The next port of call is the aforementioned console releases. They’ve teamed up with Fangamer for a run of the game in physical form, alongside a digital release on both platforms. You can <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/pages/mouthwashing-physical-edition">sign up to be notified</a> of the physical edition’s availability –&nbsp;it’s sure to be in high demand, like so many indie game physical prints.</p>

<p>The Fangamer partnership will go beyond just the physical game, with a bunch of Mouthwashing merch that will include apparel, plushies, vinyl and more.</p>

			<p>Today, in <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetEase's Q4 earnings report</a>, we learned that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players to date across all platforms. Here's the relevant tidbit:</p>
<p><em>Marvel Rivals topped Steam's global top sellers chart shortly after its launch on December 6, amassing over 10 million registered users within 72 hours and over 40 million to date. Its Season 1 update in January 2025 sparked another surge, claiming the No. 1 spots on Steam's top sellers and most-played charts worldwide.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game had surpassed 20 million players just eleven days after its launch. In the first month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to have earned more than $135 million. That didn't stop NetEase from essentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing the Western support team</a>, though, much to the disappointment of fans. Of course, that doesn't mean the publisher is putting less effort into supporting this highly successful game - but the workforce will be based in China, where development is obviously cheaper.</p>
<p>Anyway, Marvel Rivals will be updated tomorrow to introduce the final two members of the Fantastic Four: Human Torch and The Thing. The former is a Duelist type of character, while the latter is, predictably, a Vanguard. The update also adds a new Convergence map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. There are several gameplay and online matchmaking tweaks, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extra 0.5 seconds of grace time will be added at the end of the overtime in all modes, optimizing situations where games may end abruptly (like when players cannot be detected due to certain hero abilities or when accidentally drift slightly outside the valid range).</li>
<li>In Quick Mode, matchmaking for substitutes will no longer occur when a quick match is about to end.</li>
<li>Optimization: Improved loading speed at the start of matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side, this Marvel Rivals update adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, on PC. We've tested this as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090 review</a>, since NVIDIA provided advanced access to the feature.</p>
<p>There's good news for AMD users, too. The developers have improved frame pacing while using FSR 3 Frame Generation, so you should get a smoother experience. Additionally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-anti-lag-2-game-integrated-tech-counter-strike-2-preview-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon Anti-Lag 2</a> is available now, reducing system latency. As a reminder, Anti-Lag 2 requires an AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series or newer GPU.</p>

<p>A new Lord of the Rings Game is coming—Tales of the Shire. It has a release date, and we know its available platforms. You can put the swords away and forget about cave trolls as Tales of the Shire is a different type of LOTR title.</p>



<p>The early months of 2025 are quite stacked. So much so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-the-shire-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a> is going under the radar. This could be for two reasons: The reception to Gollum and Return to Moira and the attention being given to other releases. But Tales of the Shire is a new type of Lord of the Rings game likely appealing to a large demographic.</p>



<p>It’s a life sim where you get to experience the day-to-day life of a hobbit in the Shire. You don’t need to pack wellies for the Dead Marshes, and Isengard can stay where it is for now. Let’s find out the juicy details for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-coming-out">When is Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fishing for food. Credit to Wētā Workshop.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game has a March 25 release date.</strong></strong></p>



<p>It arrives during a busy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 2025</a> with the likes of Killing Floor 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a> might be the one for you if you’re not into life sims instead of shooters, post-apocalyptic titles, and wrestling</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-platforms">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch are the peculiar choices of platform for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</strong></p>



<p>I say peculiar because seldom do you see a title release for the Switch, and not old-gen PS4 and Xbox One consoles. This is the reality of the situation, so if you do own any of these formats, you can celebrate and get ready for elevenses.</p>



<p>If you are on old-gen, don’t rule out future ports if the game succeeds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you picking this one up as a Lord of the Rings fan? Or because you enjoy life-sim games in the region of The Sims and Stardew Valley? Plus, can Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game break the recent jinx and deliver a solid LOTR title?</p>

            <p>Supergiant have released their third big update for slashy dashy roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, and it adds familiar murdergod Ares to the roster of deities helping you out. Like other immortals he'll offer boons 'n' blessings while smarming at you from afar. The update also adds a new animal familiar - a polecat named Gale who will please defensive players by boosting your dodge chance and movement speed. Which you might need if you travel the surface route towards mount Olympus - because the game now has a "final confrontation" that way. </p>

<p>For players deep into Greek mythology and Supergiant's retelling, the gurgling and scaly appendage teased at the end of the above trailer will be enough to guess the final final (final?) boss. For simpletons such as I, who haven't even defeated vanilla boss Chronos, you might have to look it up. I did, and yes, this foe is definitely large and perhaps even in charge. </p>
<p>Other highlights of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569349">the update detailed on Steam</a> include a bunch more story events, dialogue, and character interactions, such as a sing-song with leafy hunter Artemis. There's new tarot card artwork at the Altar of Ashes (the place you prep passive skills and such before a run). And there are two new enemy types to stab - a jellyfish foe in Oceanus and a hulkin' big lad in the Rift of Thessaly.</p>
<p>As usual with the game's major updates, there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">a lengthy scroll of patchnotes</a> that details the new stuff and all changes big and small. "Various forms of wildlife now may appear throughout the Crossroads," it teases. "Melinoë will sometimes cover up the family portrait in her tent after brooding too much," we are told. And my personal favourite of the notes: "Fixed Icarus missing his targets unexpectedly (unless you're his father and expect disappointment)."</p>
<p>Supergiant are already working on the next big update, which'll look at mixing up boss battles to give repeat runs more variation, along with plans to expand on "various character relationships". But this won't arrive until "some months from now". They're giving no clues as to when a 1.0 release is coming but seem happy to have given some sense of a finale to players who dash off towards Olympus.</p>
<p>"With the core structure of both the Underworld and Surface routes now fully intact, we're excited to turn our attention to filling out more of the game's content categories, finishing more and more of what we started... until we're done!"</p>
<p>The first Hades was in early access for just under two years. Whereas this sequel hasn't been out even a year yet. So if you're waiting around for the final release, um, just wait longer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At a glance, the footage seems to focus on a pre-Hulk Bruce Banner suspended in midair in what appears to be a testing room – but it’s more than that. Marvel fans will recognize this eight-armed version of the gamma-infused doctor as an unpolished, Marvel Rivals-inspired take on classic Spider-Man villain Doctor Octopus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's stiff and a touch goofy, but the likeness is unmistakable. Squint and you’ll see a well-thought-out concept of what Doc Ock could potentially look and move like should NetEase ever decide to send Otto Octavius crawling into Marvel Rivals. With his arms able to magnetize the player up and around obstacles, WickedCube’s idea come-to-life essentially allows the character to fly so long as he’s close enough to a stable structure – an important note in a game with destructible environments. This rough Doc Ock concept even comes with named abilities, including Havoc Claw for the standard melee attack and a ranged move called Wrecking Grip. At 16,000 upvotes at the time of publication, it’s impressive, playable, and made entirely by one person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Doc Ock has always been one of the coolest villains in Spider-Man, and his tentacles would be a challenge to implement,” WickedCube tell us, describing where his inspiration stemmed from. “As far as I know, they haven't been fully implemented with playable 3D movement in a game before.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The India-based indie game developer previously worked with Space Engineers studio Keen Software House before resigning <a href="https://wickedcube.itch.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to focus on his own project</a> in January 2024. He's been looking for contract positions and prototyping mechanics since then, so character work usually isn’t a priority. Creating a controllable version of Doctor Octopus in Unity required clearing a few hurdles, but it’s this exact challenge that helped WickedCube pursue the idea. The rest of the push came from an unlikely source: the recent PSN outage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It all started when PSN was down and I couldn’t play Marvel Rivals,” WickedCube explains. “While browsing Twitter, I came across some <a href="https://x.com/LordDepis/status/1883639630404407479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>really cool Doc Ock fan art</u></a>.

WickedCube calls the reception “incredibly rewarding,” adding that he’d be more than happy to see the Marvel Rivals studio lift some of his ideas should Doc Ock officially make his way into the game. Although he has no plans to polish the design further, the goal is to release a playable version of the character in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After seeing the response on Reddit, I want to share this and future concepts as a YouTube tutorial series,” WickedCube added. “I also plan to open-source the code on GitHub and make the playable versions available on Itch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase will charge forward with its Marvel Rivals post-launch plans with two new official characters this Friday: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">the Human Torch and The Thing</a>. Both heroes follow their Fantastic Four teammates, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who launched early last month. It’s a shockingly strong start that outpaces competitors in its field, but comic book fans can’t help but look to Marvel’s catalog of heroes and villains as a universe with limitless potential.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WickedCube’s post says his viral project was born out of the community’s desire to see more Vanguard, or tank-like characters, added to its roster. Not even the strongest rumor has suggested we’ll see Otto show up in-game any time soon, but the Doc Ock designer says he’s already cooking up more ideas for other potential heroes. Two names on his mind are X-Men mainstays Nightcrawler and Professor Xavier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The character roster at launch is large enough to keep the game enjoyable for a long time, and the rate at which they’ve promised to release new characters is mind-blowing,” he added. “The designers clearly understand how to make a fun game, which, in my opinion, is the hardest thing to get right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is primed to deliver its Season 1 mid-season update tomorrow, February 21. In addition to those aforementioned character releases, the content update will add balance changes, gameplay tweaks, and more.

			<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei</a> and developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/omega-force">Omega Force</a> achieved a landmark success with their reboot of the long-running <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise. As we concluded in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, there’s no going back for the series now that it has established a strong new gameplay formula – then along comes Warriors: Abyss.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warriors: Abyss - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jn238X1UXoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This wonderfully experimental spin on the Musou template offers up a Roguelite remix that apes the action-packed lunacy of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. From a top-down perspective, you’ll descend into an underworld overrun by demonic nasties, playing as one of the many characters from the combined Dynasty Warriors and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors">Samurai Warriors</a> rosters.</p>


<p>Despite the shift in perspective, Warriors: Abyss will feel instantly familiar to Koei fans. Each of the 100+ heroes have had their own unique movesets lifted from past games in the Warriors series to give them all a distinct flavour. You’ll be met with little resistance against the waves of rank and file grunts who may occasionally try and get a swing in as you clobber them by the dozen. However, as you advance between waves, these enemies will be flanked by an increasingly diverse menagerie of monsters – each run of Warriors: Abyss will inevitably climax with hundreds of foes writhing on-screen beneath a chaotic purple lattice of telegraphed attack indicators.</p>
<p>To help cleave through the madness, players have plenty of loadout options at their disposal. Between phases (in which you’re usually required to KO a set number of enemies or complete a specific mission) you’ll have the option to recruit other heroes into your Formation, each offering stat bonuses and abilities. For your first few runs you’ll likely ignore the finer details of these mechanics, but you’ll quickly find there’s plenty of options to tweak your playstyle, collecting specific heroes to find synergies and unlock powerful upgrades whether that’s an increased attack range/speed or imbuing your weapon with one of several element types.</p>


<p>Recruited heroes can also be assigned to the six attack combos each character comes equipped with. Once you pull off a combo you can hit the special attack button again to summon that designated hero and have them pull off their own flashy move. Naturally, Warriors Abyss also brings back Musou attacks with an additional gauge allowing you to assemble the heroes in your formation and have them wreak havoc on-screen until it depletes.</p>
<p>At its peak, Warriors Abyss conjures a whirlwind of total destruction that can barely be contained from both a gameplay and technical perspective with the PS5 version occasionally dropping frames. Even for seasoned Musou fans whose virtual body counts climb into the millions, this chaotic display will prove overwhelming yet it’s true to the genre. To help master the chaos, you can spend the in-game currency you acquire to unlock and upgrade heroes between each run while also tracking down each of their unique weapons while exploring the underworld.</p>

<p>Your end goal is to make it as far as you can through Gouma’s gauntlet, eventually going toe-to-toe with the game’s main antagonist. Instead of chucking ending waves of enemies in your path, you’ll advance between stages with each area/biome culminating in a boss fight. These are pretty damn tough with punishing attacks that will force you to think carefully, dodging with precise timing and planning your hero summons.</p>
<p>Due to the near unreadable number of effects popping off on-screen at any one time, visual artistry isn’t a primary focus. Each of the Warriors character models are excellently designed (with plenty of costume DLC up for grabs) yet you see very little of them amidst the swarm of demons and a never-ending onslaught of screen-filling attack animations. There’s very little appealing about the enemy or environment designs and though some fans will take an interest in the narrative that weaves together playthroughs, I opted to skip most of the dialogue.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-2%E2%80%99s-tower-raid-mode-is-now-permanently-in-the-game.1114101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-mode-permanent-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has a new permanent game mode, but it’s one you’ve probably played before. The team at Techland has pushed ‘Tower Raid’ into the game permanently, bolstering the intense roguelite mode with fresh challenges and mechanics.</p>



<p>As a live-service title, Dying Light 2 is regularly updated with new content drops, bounties, limited-time events, and skin packs. Out of all those deliverables, Tower Raid is one of the most positively received add-ons since the game emerged in 2022, and fans are happy to see it made into a permanent fixture in the open-world, zombie-slaying title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fail-get-tougher-repeat">‘Fail, Get Tougher, Repeat’</h2>



<p>Tower Raid is what it sounds like. Players – either solo or with friends – are tasked with ascending a tower packed with enemies that get increasingly difficult to defeat the higher you go. There are three difficulty tiers, with the topmost level, ‘Elite’, being nothing short of punishing – but it yields incredible rewards.</p>



<p>Players are invited to pick from four classes, each boasting a unique skill set and loadout. The inherent roguelite nature of the mode means that you can mix and match your playstyles to see what works best, as every time you enter the tower, you’ll never really know what to expect.</p>



<p>To welcome the permanent mode, Techland has added new rewards to the ‘Raid Hub’, fronted by a trader called Sola. If you play Tower Raid, you can unlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>Office Day Outfit</li>



<li>Kuai Dagger</li>



<li>Silenced Pistol</li>
</ul>



<p>Amongst other things, of course.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end here, though. Techland has stressed that, after a few weeks on the market, a survey will be posted for players to give their feedback about the upgraded Tower Raid mode. That means that things could get even better.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland laid out a roadmap of content in celebration of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">10th anniversary of Dying Light</a>. I caught up with the team to learn about what happened to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-dying-light-my-apocalypse-edition/">$386,000 collector’s edition</a>, and at Gamescom, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">spoke to Roger Craig Smith</a> about the upcoming release of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Dying Light 2: Stay Human? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has now been confirmed to air next week, on Thursday 27th February at 2pm UK time. That's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation on this date to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy. This year is no different. 
</p>
<p>
So, what do we expect to see?

<p>
This year's biggest Pokémon launch will undoubtedly be Pokémon Legends Z-A, which was announced last year in a brief teaser that curiously did not show any gameplay. The title is a Switch 1 game, but will we see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version confirmed - or the game running on Nintendo's newly-announced hardware?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Legends Z-A is set to take players back to the Kalos region</a>, the setting of Pokémon X and Y, and looks like it will once again feature the popular Mega Evolution mechanic.
</p>
<p>
As another Legends game, it will likely have more of an action-RPG focus, similar to the previous Pokémon Legends Arceus. But where that game was set in the distant past, Z-A appears to be set in the modern day or near future.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a big focus on Z-A, Presents will likely feature a look at the franchise's other various ongoing games - such as Pokémon Unite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
This week, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go is in talks to be sold to the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group</a>, in a deal worth  $3.5bn. But don't expect to hear an update on that next week.
</p>
<p>
As ever, Eurogamer will be covering all the announcements from Pokémon Presents - join us then for more.

            <p>The second major update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is now available, adding a new Olympian: the god of war.</p>
<p>Appropriately named the Warsong Update, Ares has now been added (but redesigned) along with all of his boons, which look to be similar to those in the first game.</p>
<p>Also added is The Final Confrontation, with a new discovery to make atop Mount Olympus. Say no more.</p>

<p>The update also includes a new animal familiar to aid in battle, new arcana arts, new enemies, new music, and new ways to relax in the Crossroads, all as per the trailer above.</p>
<p>And of course, the story expands with new events too.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, developer Supergiant Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">detailed all the additions</a> - along with quality of life tweaks and bug fixes, there are reworked boons and blessings, new upgrades and keepsakes, changes to level designs and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-new-region-weapon-familiars-and-more-in-first-major-early-access-update">first major update for Hades 2</a> (the Olympic Update) was back in October last year, which the Warsong Update follows along with other smaller patches.</p>
<p>The game remains in early access for now and, as noted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=503942841152569349">separate Steam blog</a>, a third major update is planned. There's still no release date for version 1.0.</p>
<p>"We're excited to have launched this Major Update, since it includes numerous ideas we've been eager to implement since we started working on Hades 2 years ago!" the post reads.</p>
<p>"But we're not finished yet, and have already made plans for our third Major Update, which we intend to deliver some months from now. Note it's still too early to share our plans beyond that, including when our v1.0 launch will be."</p>
<p>Last year creative director Greg Kasavin said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year-says-creative-director">game would be in early access "at least through the end of this year"</a>. It seems that's set to extend for a while yet.</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>. Clearly there are still plenty more surprises to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-asia-joins-forces-thailand-game-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Gamescom team has revealed a monumental partnership between Gamescom Asia and the Thailand Game Show, the fruits of which will be witnessed later this year. Gamescom is the leading name in gaming events and over the last four years, the Asian representation of that label has gone from strength to strength.</p>



<p>Now, Gamescom Asia will be relocated from Singapore to Bangkok, linking up with the Thailand Game Show to welcome more visitors than ever before.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-historic-collaboration">‘Historic Collaboration’</h2>



<p>In a press release published by the Gamescom PR team, the new partnership was celebrated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This partnership is a game-changer for the region’s games industry. gamescom asia’s success has been built on a solid foundation in Singapore, where it has flourished since its inception in 2021, positioning Southeast Asia as a hub for gaming innovation. </p>



<p>By joining forces with Thailand Game Show, we are unlocking unprecedented opportunities to connect global video game players with one of the world’s most vibrant and passionate gaming communities. With its rich culture and expanding gaming ecosystem, Bangkok is the ideal stage for this exciting next chapter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The President of Thailand’s Digital Economy Promotion Agency echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The collaboration between gamescom asia and Thailand Game Show marks a significant milestone for Thailand’s growing role in the global gaming industry. This partnership strengthens our commitment to advancing digital innovation and creativity. </p>



<p>DEPA and the local gaming industry are excited to be part of this unified event, creating new opportunities for global collaboration, investment, and talent development, and reinforcing Thailand’s position as a leading destination in the digital entertainment sector.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2024 edition of Gamescom Asia attracted more than 40,000 attendees from 78 countries, the press release explained. It’s not as gargantuan as the core version of Gamescom, which takes place annually in Cologne, Germany, but it’s growing – and that’s all that matters.</p>



<p>This kind of ‘combination activity’ isn’t a new concept. Last year in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">MCM and EGX</a>, two of the biggest pop culture and gaming events in the nation, joined forces to produce one mega event.</p>

			<p>Netflix has recently laid off a number of employees at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio. The news was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by website Game Developer, with Netflix declining to comment on the story. Reportedly, the studio's upcoming projects lineup hasn't been impacted, so it might be a relatively small number. Still, it's yet another instance of game industry layoffs. Just over the last handful of months, we've had to cover layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Rez</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-rez-studios-lays-off-developers-from-smite-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice</a>, actually), <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-lay-off-hundreds-of-california-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-cancels-game-and-lays-off-a-few-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riot Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-staff-members-majority-were-subcontractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros.

<p>Netflix <a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Night School Studio in September 2021 for an undisclosed sum to bolster its gaming output. Almost two years later, the California-based developer launched Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. On Wccftech, the game earned an 8 out of 10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from reviewer Ule Lopez</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oxenfree 2 feels like it relies on its dialogue system a bit too much as its more exciting elements take a backseat. While the dialogue is still incredible, the appearance of these more unique sequences left me often asking where I would be able to find more of the unique time-altering puzzles and surreal visuals that also made it stand out over other games. The character writing is still as good as the first game, but it feels like more could have been done to make it stand above the first game.</em></p>
<p>Netflix made the news around three months ago because Mike Verdu, VP at GenAI for Netflix Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-investing-in-generative-ai-for-games-after-closing-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about a big push to use AI technologies:</p>
<p><em>I am working on driving a "once in a generation" inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</em></p>
<p><em>I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster, and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams.</em></p>
<p>The controversy was that Netflix had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed down its only triple-A game studio</a>, which was working on a third-person action role-playing game for PC. This made it seem like the company was interested in 'replacing' workers with AI tech. Time will tell if that's truly the direction they are set on.</p>

Getting big-picture about the human condition, he added, “We were not meant to receive this kind of feedback from basically anyone, anywhere in the world.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the conversation, MrBeast claimed his job was “killing” him because he doesn’t ever stop working. “I work every hour my eyes are awake,” said the creator. </p><p>“The average person does not want to live this life…in my head just working all the time? And they would probably just ask themselves, why am I working all the time? I don’t do literally anything else.”</p><p>Making it harder for him to work, beyond the human need to sleep, is the fact that at age 15, MrBeast was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, he says. </p><p>“I just get sick all the time, like random rashes and things like that,” said the creator. “So it’s pretty, pretty brutal, to be honest, and then it randomly clears up sometimes and just makes you very sick, very tired. It hurts like crazy, because it gets very inflamed, and it feels like someone’s stabbing me in the gut with like a knife constantly.”</p><h2 id="h816"><a id=""></a>MrBeast talks money, BeastGames, and being broke</h2><p>Still, despite the pain, mental health problems, and death threats, all this work has made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201">MrBeast a lot of money</a></span>, right?

Which, yeah, that’s less than I expected, though there are some really big numbers between 1 and 999,999. But while it’s clear that MrBeast has money and a lot of it, if you ask him about it, it seems like he doesn’t like being rich. </p><p>“It was like so much easier when you’re broke, if you don’t travel constantly,” said MrBeast. “Life is so easy when you just wake up in your own bed and work 15 hours compared with all this fucking bullshit where I’m like, ‘I don’t know the time zone I’m in, I don’t know what place on it’...some days I’m going to 10am, other days I’m going to 5pm.”</p><p>I’m not sure life is easier when you are poor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-preview-all-the-boobs-in-the-world-cant-hide-its-shallow-grind<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is a fantasy multiplayer game that’s hotly anticipated in the gacha gaming community. It’s all about cool-looking combat, grinding, and oh yeah – boobs. And based on what I’ve played so far, the busty barmaids and endless slog for incrementally better gear aren’t likely to capture your attention for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played an early PC build of Duet Night Abyss ahead of its closed beta test, with the caveat that I wasn’t able to experience multiplayer functionality, so consider this preview to be more about Duet Night’s mechanics, world, and the grand narrative that underpins it all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your player character, a beautiful waif in bandages, awakens in a swirling snowfield. Mysterious voices speak to you. You are helpless and breathy. But out of the snow, someone reaches for you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Berry, a major character who’ll see you through the basics of movement in this world: most notably, the Helix Jump – a slick way of vaulting yourself through the air. There’s no cooldown on that jump, and you’ll find quickly that it’s a fun and efficient way of getting around – and powerful in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once separated from Berry, you’ll really begin to come into your own – both gameplay-wise and narratively speaking. Broke in a strange new city run by the ominously named Empire, you must become a “Phoxhunter,” picking up “commissions” at a rough-and-tumble tavern owned by the world’s least believable barmaaid. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait. That’s only half the story. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Double Take</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a second protagonist, a male version who looks strikingly similar to the girl you just met. The idea is that these two show different sides of the same narrative. In the city, the girl sees townsfolk experiencing discrimination, violence, and cruelty at the hands of the Empire. Meanwhile, the boy is a part of the Empire, commanding the same brutish soldiers who are now wounded and pitiful after battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much has been made of these dual protagonists and plotlines, but frankly, I don’t think they’re as revolutionary as the developer seems to think they are. There were no surprises, no events in one character’s story that might make the other’s revelatory. Of course, this is early on, and I hope to be proven wrong as more story content becomes available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, solid story or not, this game’s art is beautiful. I loved the linework, the colours, the fluid animation. I tend to approach the anime aesthetic with skepticism, so trust that my praise says something about how polished and breathtaking the aesthetic was. Unfortunately, I began to feel less enthusiastic the boobier Duet Night became (more on that later).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The English voiceover is absolutely fantastic, one of Duet Night’s highlights. As I progressed and met more characters, I found each one’s voice and dialogue distinct and full of individual personality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re through the initial story quests, you’ll be participating in a lot of combat. It’ll be familiar to anyone who has ever played any kind of hack-and-slash, but it’s fun for a while. All the shiny sword slashes and oversized guns look epic, especially paired with the Helix Jump ability.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switching between melee and ranged weapons is seamless. And to really hone your killing skills, you can equip the ridiculously named Demon Wedges: equippable supplements to your weapons that bump up various stats. You can mix-and-match a few of these at any time, playing around with combinations to find synergies that could take your combat to the next level.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Daily Grind</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have an unclear sense of Duet Night’s intended monetization model. There are hints, of course, such as multiple currencies – I was overwhelmed trying to understand where to obtain each one, and what each one could buy. Though there didn’t yet appear to be an interface to spend IRL money, you can bet that’s coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest. Take the “Retrace” system, which is a dice roll to win a bunch of random new weapons to pick from. It’s literally “click a button and see what you get.” Your rewards may be epic, but are mostly not. Provided you have enough of the “Hourglass” currency, you can just hammer that Retrace button like a slot machine. It’s one of the least engaging things I have ever seen in my time as a gamer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also pick up “commissions” from the aforementioned tavern, which are instances where you’ll do most of your flashy combat. They may have different themes (a church overgrown with grass, for example, or a mine), but they all follow the same formula: a bunch of rooms that look exactly the same, where you can defeat increasingly difficult – and boring – waves of monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can grind for weapons to craft into better weapons. Grind for coins to buy cosmetic items, like a chicken for your head. Grind to obtain new playable avatars (most of them busty women). Or you can enter “Sandrealm Meditation,” which is a euphemism for practicing your combat skills via – you guessed it – grinding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all the flashy abilities, gear, and flower hats you’re grinding for mean nothing without an audience to impress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I did not experience any of Duet Night's social aspects. The instances can match you up with three other players – friends or randoms – but given that I was playing before the closed beta began, there was no one for me to match up with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Duet Night will feel like less of a grind as it opens up to players and a community grows, though I’m not sure at this stage what that would look like.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alone in a Crowd</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I recognize that grindy games do have an audience, but as a game reviewer, I feel icky recommending them when there are so many more engaging, delightful, and dare I say interactive games out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the beginning, I thought I might like Duet Night Abyss. In those first moments I felt like I was watching a beautifully animated film, and intrigued where the waif’s story might lead me – even if I did have to grind my way there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then the, uh, curvaceous women began appearing. This isn’t uncommon in anime – but it immediately narrows the audience down to one of… specific tastes. I personally felt isolated: as slick as Duet Night Abyss was, I could never fully appreciate the better parts of it, such as the art or cute side quests, knowing that this game wasn’t looking for players like me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an audience out there for Duet Night Abyss. But it isn’t me. Maybe it’ll be you.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Strengthen the Main Character’s Abilities with Power-Up Items Called “Artifacts”</strong></p><p>By positioning the main character and supporting characters within a Magic Circle, the supporting characters’ power, known as “<a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>,” flows toward the main character. The main character’s abilities are enhanced by placing and activating magical items called “Artifacts,” which provide various enhancement effects on the spaces where Mana flows.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Use Artifacts to power-up the main character.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By placing the Artifact “Stone Guard” on green space, the main character’s DEF will increase.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Among the Artifacts are “Anywhere Artifacts,” which can be placed on any space, regardless of its type. They are useful as they can be conveniently placed anywhere.</p><p><em>—“Mana Plus” is a useful Artifact that can be placed on any space, regardless of type. It restores Mana when your Mana reaches zero.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Some Spaces Activate an Effect Even without Placing an Artifact</strong></p><p>Some spaces in a Magic Circle activate effects by simply having Mana following through them. These are called “Fixed Spaces.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fixed Spaces have various effects, such as always reviving dead supporting characters when passing through a dungeon gate, or switching the equipped weapon to the one placed on a space while active.</p><p><strong>Customize Skills and Magic with Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles can also enhance the skills and magic assigned to the main character.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>By placing an Artifact on a space marked “Skill Magic 1” in a Magic Circle, you can enhance the skill or magic assigned to that slot.</p><p>Not only can you expand the range and increase the power of your skills, you can also increase their level.</p><p><em>—Double a skill’s level to increase its power and expand its range!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>High-level skills and magic consume a lot of SP, so they can’t be used frequently. In such cases, you can use Artifacts to “lower their level” or “increase their power,” combining them to create various effects. Explore and find the combination that best suits your gameplay style and the dungeon you’re trying to clear.</p><p><strong>“Titles” Further Enhance Artifacts</strong></p><p>Some Artifacts have special effects called “Titles.” These Titles enhance Artifacts further.</p><p><em>—The effects of Titles can be checked by pressing the “<a title="Platforms > Switch [16,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>” button on Artifacts list.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>One notable Title is “Union.” When you place Artifacts with the same “Union” Title next to each other, they will “unite” and share each other’s effects. For example, if you place an Artifact that increases ATK by 1 next to one that increases DEF by 1, both ATK and DEF will increase by 2. “Union” is a powerful Title, as its effects stack with the number of connected “Union” Titles.</p><p><em>—The enhancement effects of “Union” Artifacts can be easily checked.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Many New Artifacts Appear, Including “Wide,” “Twin,” and “Zero”</strong></p><p>“Wide” is a powerful Artifact that doubles the effects of all spaces beyond where it is placed. If “Wide” is placed on a skill or magic space, it will turn the skill or magic into a wide-range (wide) version.</p><p><em>—Here is a look at the same magic before and after the placement of a “Wide” Artifact. After placement, the wall of flames effect has a wider range.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Twin” transforms into the Artifact placed on the next space, granting you twice the power. Additionally, Mana consumption is halved, allowing you to double the strength of powerful Artifacts at half the cost.</p><p><em>—After the placement of a “Twin” artifact next to an Artifact that requires 11 Mana and increases ATK by 3, Mana cost decreases to 5 while ATK now increases by 6.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Zero” is an Artifact that enables the Artifact placed on the next space to activate with zero Mana. If the next space is a Fixed Space, its effect will be nullified.</p><p><em>—With “Zero,” you can use Artifacts that consume a lot of Mana or activate Fixed Spaces with debuff effects without having to worry about the drawbacks.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Enhancement 2. Power-Up By Placing Supporting Characters in Your <a title="Genres > Party [86 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>! They Will Shoulder the Main Character’s Burden!</strong></p><p>Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle act as a shield for the main character, taking damage in their place when attacked. The main character will not take any damage unless the HP of all supporting characters reaches zero.</p><p><em>—Simply place three supporting characters to boost your HP by three characters’ worth and significantly power you up!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><p>However, if a supporting character’s HP drops to zero and they are defeated, the Artifact buffs provided by that supporting character will disappear, causing the main character to lose power. To prevent this, consider placing supporting characters with high HP, or position supporting characters with low HP inside a Magic Circle where they are less likely to be attacked.</p><p><em>—When all the supporting characters’ HP reaches zero, the main character can be directly attacked.

It is especially useful in boss battles.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_027.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_028.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Saint Magic Circle “Honor” is a highly effective Magic Circle for dungeons with many traps. On floors that are multiples of three (such as the third, sixth, and so on), it grants the “Flying” state, allowing you to bypass all ground traps. It is especially useful in dungeons with multiple floors that are multiples of three.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_029.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_030.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to these, there are over 20 types of Magic Circles that each class can learn. There are also special Magic Circles that can be obtained by clearing specific “Magic Maps” (Mapgeons) under certain conditions.</p><p><strong>Develop and Level Up Your Characters in Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles not only enhance characters, they also serve as a party development system. Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle and exploring dungeons with you will gain experience points and level up. By using Magic Circles that allow you to set more supporting characters, you can level up your party more efficiently.</p><p><em>—Somewhere in the world is a hidden Magic Circle that allows the placement of 16 supporting characters…!?</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_031.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are also Artifacts that can boost the stats that increase when a supporting character levels up.

            <p>
Sony has responded to former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett's $200m USD wrongful dismissal lawsuit, detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".
</p>
<p>
Barrett's departure from Bungie was first reported last March, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">word of a leadership shakeup</a> at the studio. However, it was later claimed Barrett was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">fired from his role following an internal investigation</a> into accusation of inappropriate behaviour filed by "at least eight" female employees. Things took further turn in December, when Barrett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-marathon-reboot-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-for-200m-claiming-wrongful-dismissal">filed a lawsuit against Bungie and Sony</a>, claiming the companies had "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating...he had engaged in sexual misconduct."
</p>
<p>
Barrett's list of accusations was long, but core to his argument was the claim his firing was a "premeditated scheme" concocted so Bungie and Sony could avoid paying him "nearly $50m... owed under his employment agreement". He additionally claimed he "did not do anything remotely resembling gross misconduct or 'Cause' as defined in the Retention Agreements... and there could not have been any credible allegation he did because [he] had a spotless twenty-five year track record at Bungie."
</p>
<p>
And now (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>), Sony has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">filed its first substantive response</a>, denying Barret's claims and detailing the events allegedly leading to his dismissal. "Multiple female, subordinate employees individually reported to Human Resources that Barrett engaged in inappropriate behaviour and disturbing written and verbal communications," it wrote, "which made them uncomfortable and fearful of retaliation if they failed to engage or reported Barrett."
</p>
<p>
"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest romantically.
</p>
<p>
"Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims," Sony continued in its court submission. "He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare' and 'Ask Me Anything'. He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers."
</p>
<p>
Sony's filing also includes several examples of Barrett's alleged misconduct, including an incident where it's claimed he FaceTimed one female employee late at night while drunk despite requests to "recognise 'boundaries'", eventually moving to his bedroom and telling her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed while talking to [VICTIM 1]".
</p>
<p>
Barrett also allegedly contacted a second employee via Instagram direct message, telling her, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention." After the employee responded saying she had a boyfriend who treated her very well, Barrett is said to have told her, "He better[.] Cuz I would hit on you if he wasn't." It's claimed he later made further contact, writing, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?".
</p>
<p>
Other incidents detailed in Sony's filing includes a "virtual game of 'Truth or Dare' initiated by Barrett", and a Microsoft Teams exchange in which he allegedly asked a female member of staff, "Are you still in PJs? [Is] it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lulu lemons?".
</p>
<p>
Sony adds, "Barrett’s predatory behaviour caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett’s constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company. Multiple victims reported to Human Resources during the investigation that they were afraid for their jobs during these encounters."
</p>
<p>
In response, Barrett's lawyers told Game File, "Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.
</p>
<p>
"Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company."
</p>
<p>
As well as denying inappropriate behaviour during his time at Bungie, Barrett's original filing argued his former employers' actions had "irreparably harmed [him] financially, physically, and emotionally". As such, he is seeking $200m in damages - including $46K (plus interest) owed under his employment terms - and is requesting to be reinstated as game director on Marathon.

An old magazine with a single screenshot of a cancelled project is video game preservation. A dusty Sega Mega Drive sitting in storage alongside a copy of <em>Sonic 2</em> and <em>Jungle Strike</em> is video game preservation. A dodgy arcade cabinet with 1000 classic arcade games on it, all of them running their original code via emulation, is video game preservation.</p><p>A Frankenstein's monster of AI-generated slop, guessing and filling in holes to try to run a game without its "original engine", is <em>not </em>games preservation, and I'm frankly astonished to see such an important figure in the video games industry go on record saying it is.</p><p>But it simply wouldn't be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=16s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI hype exercise</a> if it wasn't built entirely on speculative horseshit and the vaguest of assertions, all in the service of trying to find <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone, <em>anyone </em>out there</a> beyond investors and tech company executives who will think any of this is worth what it's costing, both in dollar terms and its environmental impact.</p><p>If you're reading this and are interested in supporting actual video game preservation, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please donate to the Video Game History Foundation</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book"><h3>Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work</h3></a><p>"Streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s lawyers say that these messages show a “pattern of misconduct.” The document was filed last week, according to <em>Game File. </em></p><p>In one message  Barrett asks a female Bungie employee, “Are you still in PJs?” and “[I]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweatpants? Lulu lemons?”</p><p>In another message, Barrett called a woman the “Holy Grail” and added:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m not hitting on you. I hope it doesn’t feel like that. I’m married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever.</p></blockquote><p>The woman replied that her boyfriend treats her “very well” and the former Bungie director replied: “He better cuz I would hit on you if he wasn’t.”</p><p>A different woman working at Bungie claims Barrett called her while drunk late at night and spent hours with her on FaceTime, despite the female employee asking him to respect her boundaries. At one point he allegedly took his phone into his bedroom and said, “I can’t believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1].” She abruptly hung up. </p><p>Barrett’s lawyer sent this statement over to <em>Game File: </em></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.</p></blockquote><p>“Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company,” said Barrett’s lawyer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
