            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/heres-how-alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-update-brings-ray-tracing-to-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed the specifics of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, with the studio taking advantage of the increased power of the console to add ray tracing, or increase the general fidelity and performance of other graphics options.</p>
<p>Built using Remedy’s Northlight engine, Alan Wake 2 on PC made good use of ray tracing hardware in Nvidia’s GPUs in particular, layering in a number of different effects to add to the strong lighting and visual style. Xbox Series X|S and PS5 just couldn’t handle them, though, and Remedy instead focussed on the core graphics and other techniques. Now with its own hardware upscaling solution on PS5 Pro – PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) – and the beefier AMD GPU, some of those ray tracing effects can also be brought to console.</p>


<p>As <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-pro---behind-the-scenes">detailed by Remedy,</a> the new PlayStation 5 Pro Quality mode will add ray traced reflections (both opaque and transparent), using an internal render resolution of 2176×1224 and PSSR to upscale that to a full 4K.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro Comparison Video ESRB" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkwWEbk66VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These specs and performance targets would seemingly put the PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/20/alan-wake-2-pc-requirements-minimum-specs-recommended-ray-tracing-gpu/">between the low and medium performance targets for ray tracing on PC</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro Comparison Video ESRB (Ballroom)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-VXtECHguk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don’t need fancier reflections, then there’s an enhanced Performance mode for PS5 Pro instead. This roughly takes the image quality and render settings of the base PS5 Quality mode, and runs them at 60FPS.</p>
<p>This leans very heavily on the upscaling of PSSR with a render resolution of 1536×864, upscaling all the way to a 4K output, and running at 60FPS. By contrast, Base PS5 Quality mode outputs at an upscaled 1440p and 30FPS.</p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro update won’t matter for a couple weeks, today is a big day for Alan Wake 2 with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/18/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-is-coming-next-week/">The Lake House DLC expansion</a>, and the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/">free Anniversary update</a>. This includes new quality of life and accessibility options. The game now has gyro aiming, inverted X axis options, improved haptics for all healing and throwables on DualSense, and not just guns, and a big suite of optional gameplay assists that contain toggles for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick turn</li>
<li>Auto complete QTE</li>
<li>Button tapping to single tap</li>
<li>Weapon charging with taps</li>
<li>Healing items with taps</li>
<li>Lightshifter with taps</li>
<li>Player invulnerability</li>
<li>Player immortality</li>
<li>One shot kill</li>
<li>Infinite ammo</li>
<li>Infinite flashlight batteries</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed.1016595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, The Sims team revealed a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming Creator Kits made by Myshunosun and Trillyke, two iconic content creators for The Sims 4. The Creator Kits will be available for PC via the EA app, Mac via Origin, Epic Games Store, and Steam. Additionally, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One users will also get to enjoy this new content. When it comes to modding the game or adding custom content to The Sims, this option has only ever been available to players on PC and Mac. However, the Creator Kits come close to what custom content brings to the table.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the Creator Kits, the Sims team released an exclusive look at the Cozy Kitsch and Sweet Slumber Party Creator Kits, which offer players new mid-century modern designs as well as sleepwear and sleepover content for those who like to give their Sims a spruced up bedroom.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-creator-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> released by EA, they state that more details will be released about the Creator Kits as the release date draws closer, and they sat down to interview Myshunosun and Trillyke about the upcoming Creator Kits. This is the first time that The Sims team has collaborated with content creators to create a full collection of in-game assets, which is a huge achievement for those who have been picked to collaborate with The Sims team.</p>
<p>By creating this new form of content, Creators can pitch their ideas to The Sims team and work alongside them to curate a collection, similar to the Storybook Nursery Creator Kit released by Sixam. As stated previously, this is a groundbreaking creation, especially for those on console, as they will finally be able to experience and utilize items created by those who have been modding and creating custom content for years. While it isn't the same as being able to pick and choose your custom content, it's a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>With the new Creator Kits coming out, it's been confirmed by The Sims Team that there will be more of them released in 2025, and they are <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/">planning on expanding the program</a> in the future. The current Creator Kits cost $4.99 to purchase and include items for Create-A-Sim as well as the Build/Buy categories, allowing those who like to play with a theme to create a Kitsch dream of their choice or a sleepy world of their choosing.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amanda-the-adventurer-2-review-you-can-read.1016592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modern indie horror games owe a lot to kids’ media. If it’s not <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-chapter-2-released-chapter-1-free-forever" rel="noopener" target="_blank">super viral horror sensations being based around cuddly kids characters</a>, it’s a game based around a cute kids' adventure game set on an apple farm. <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is no stranger to that trend, with the original title taking the premise of an old <em>Dora the Explorer</em>-style show hosted by a possibly possessed little girl called Amanda. After the success of the first game, can the sequel continue the story and expand the gameplay?</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-an-animated-rendition-of-a-public-library.jpg?itok=PJ0LQO89 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-an-animated-rendition-of-a-public-library.jpg?itok=ijki-hpk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The animated cutscenes are sparse but a welcome addition to the game.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is a first-person atmospheric horror puzzle game set in your friendly local library. After escaping the attic location of the previous release, you’re now in a fresh location with another bundle of tapes to watch through. You’ll once again need to deal with the demonic little girl, piece together various clues, and eventually escape from the monster that is haunting you.</p>
<p>If you’re into the theorizing aspect of these games, then you won’t be disappointed either. As you explore your surroundings and watch through the tapes, there are plenty of hints and snatches of information for you to decipher the meta-narrative that ties the whole thing together. If you want. As with many such stories, you’ll get out of it what you put into it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It’s All Available At Your Local Library!</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-with-a-scratchy-kids-tv-show-playing-featuring-a-little-girl-in-a-dark-room-with-a-train.jpg?itok=AR0JDpQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-with-a-scratchy-kids-tv-show-playing-featuring-a-little-girl-in-a-dark-room-with-a-train.jpg?itok=iMwGpJoA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes these tapes end up in pretty dark places.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Amanda The Adventurer</em></a>'s original setting of a spooky attic full of forgotten children’s VHS tapes was a bit more “classic horror”, there’s something more than a little unsettling and liminal about an empty library. Even when starting the game, before anything expressly creepy has even happened, it’s a bit strange to wander around somewhere so quiet when you’re locked in alone at night. Even before Amanda and her low-poly animation starts menacing you on your first VHS tape.</p>
<p>Before you even get started with any of those analog horror shenanigans you have to wrestle with the real core of the game: logic puzzles.</p>
<p>Starting out, you can explore to find a VHS player, but no tapes lying out in the open. You’ll have to unlock the librarian’s cupboard with a 4-digit code to progress and to do that, you’ll have to actually explore and interact with the library to progress further.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Gameplay Loop for the Ages</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-piggy-bank-with-a-digital-display-on-it-near-a-lot-of-library-books-on-a-huge-shelf.jpg?itok=-n4P_W59 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-piggy-bank-with-a-digital-display-on-it-near-a-lot-of-library-books-on-a-huge-shelf.jpg?itok=5QEcOdb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never know how proud of myself I was to get the number to go up to 10.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways, the gameplay loop of <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is very similar to the first game. You have to solve a logic puzzle to either gain a new tape or further the progress on your current tape. Instead of having a few random items in your attic this time, there’s a whole library full of books and constantly changing equipment for you to puzzle your way through, and wow there were a lot of puzzles.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the volume of puzzles is actually any higher than last time, but they were really satisfying here. Most of them derived from pretty logical starting points, making them enjoyable to solve, even when they were being tougher to piece together. Most of the time, you really just have to rely on good observation skills to gather the information you need to proceed, but there’s also the added bonus of the library’s copy machines acting as hint generators which helped to ease the mental burden at times.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spooky, Scary, Or Spoopy?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-screen-with-a-dead-bird-in-the-mouth-of-a-cat-on-it.jpg?itok=Z6VJ_AQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-screen-with-a-dead-bird-in-the-mouth-of-a-cat-on-it.jpg?itok=KXY-QW-v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While it rarely strays into scary territory, the game can certainly be pretty unsettling.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>An important question with any horror game, analog or otherwise, is whether or not it counts as scary, and as always, that’s a tough question to answer. I have to admit that at no point during my playthrough did I feel particularly terrified or inclined to jump out of my skin, but there was plenty of tense atmosphere and creepiness to provide the right atmosphere for this sort of story and general theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, the monster you’re dealing with here isn’t particularly scary, mostly because it spends a lot of the time in this game just standing right out in the open in front of you for extended periods. That said, Amanda herself and some of the contents of the tapes that you end up watching can be downright unsettling, and the VHS effects combined with the old-school TV show animation gives it a little extra dose of immersion to have you on edge.</p>
<h2>Extras, Extras</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-two-character-on-a-tv-bending-over-a-picnic-table.jpg?itok=cD3Zpb3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-two-character-on-a-tv-bending-over-a-picnic-table.jpg?itok=hJivT2Ye 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm not even sure who he's trying to convince anyomre.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As I said before, you’ll get out of <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> as much as you put into it. There are a lot of fun puzzles and a tense and creepy atmosphere on offer, making this a perfect game for Halloween. More than that, there’s the tangential storyline about what happened to create Amanda, and what exactly the company Hamelin are and where they came from. You can even gain a lot of extra information about the story by finding all of the secrets and revisiting the game after you’re done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a lot of that extra detail is only going to be found if you go digging for it. There’s a fun game to play and if you only want to run through puzzles you can play it and then move on after a handful of hours. If you intend to dig deeper, you could be playing for a long time. Then again, if you’re anything like me, you’ll get stuck on the last puzzle and run up your playtime artificiality while you’re banging your head into a brick wall.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Amanda The Adventurer 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-girl-lying-on-a-brown-sofa.jpg?itok=ewvpM-ut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-girl-lying-on-a-brown-sofa.jpg?itok=1lHfsQP7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cheerful little cursor doesn't fit the scene too much right here.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> feels like a fitting expansion to the original game. The plot is bigger, the puzzles are a bit more varied and interesting, and the new setting gives you more room to move around in, literally. The meta-narrative surrounding the Amanda character and what brought her into existence is still interesting, and even those who only stick around for the puzzles will still have an interesting time. Just don’t expect to go to bed with bad dreams unless you get frightened really easily.</p>

For folks like me who haven’t seen the movies, the game doesn’t expect you to have seen past films or fully understand what’s going on in this world. The game explains just enough about what’s happening and provides enough context that I never felt lost.<br></p><p>In <em>The Road Ahead</em> you star as Alex, a young woman with asthma who, in the opening moments, loses her boyfriend to one of the alien monsters after discovering she’s pregnant with his child. This doesn’t help her relationship with her BF’s mom, who already blames her for the death of her husband and becomes disturbingly aggressive when she learns that Alex is carrying the last member of her family. So Alex and her older father escape their clutches, but in doing so get separated—that means an asthmatic, pregnant, and mourning Alex must make her way alone through the alien-infested world to reach some semblance of safety.<br></p><p>I really appreciate that<em> The Road Ahead </em>doesn’t rely solely on the alien monsters to add tension and intrigue to the game. Instead, they act more as an ever-present background threat—similar to how George A. Romero used zombies in his movies—as a small group of people fight for survival while trying to deal with a lot of trauma. But don’t be mistaken, the blind and nearly indestructible aliens are always around and ready to pounce on you if you get too loud or careless.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646">Similar to <em>Alien Isolation</em></a></span>, you aren’t really fighting the monsters in <em>Road Ahead</em>. Instead, 90% of the game is focused on avoiding them by being very quiet and careful. This is done by moving slowly, avoiding surfaces that make a lot of noise—like broken glass or water—using items as distractions and even pouring out sand to create safe paths to walk on, like in the movies. (I’ve seen the trailers!) </p><p>Most of my time was spent carefully tiptoeing around metal cans and piles of leaves. Even opening a door or turning a valve to solve a simple puzzle is nerve-wracking in a universe where one loud squeak or bang can get you killed. The game makes you slowly pull, push, and turn doors, vent openings, valves, dresser drawers, and more using your controller’s analog stick. Make a single mistake, like carelessly trying to run out of a warehouse or fling open a door to safety, and you’ll be attacked and killed in one hit. </p><p>Thankfully, when this happened to me, the game’s checkpoints were frequent enough that I never lost too much progress. Still, whenever I accidentally kicked a can, I froze in real life and hoped the creatures wouldn’t get me.<br></p><p>Alex’s asthma plays a big part in the game and takes the place of a traditional health bar. Because the monsters in<em> A Quiet Place</em> are incredibly lethal and kill you instantly for being too loud, the devs couldn’t use a traditional health meter like in<em> Resident Evil</em> or <em>Silent Hill</em>. Instead, you have to manage your stress and asthma. Running too much or carrying heavy objects for too long will start to strain your lungs, as will getting too close to the monsters, which causes Alex to stress out.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-recommend-id="image://51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-recommend-id="image://51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If Alex pushes herself too far, she can suffer an asthmatic attack, which could get you killed depending on where you are and when it happens. So you need to manage your asthma with inhalers and pills found around the world.

It tells a compelling story that keeps you moving forward and knows when to call it and not stick around too long and run the concept into the ground. Good scary games tend to work better as shorter experiences and the devs behind <em>Road Ahead</em> seem to get this. </p><p>While this new<em> Quiet Place </em>game isn’t the most innovative or scariest game I’ve played, it’s a very well-made and tense adventure that had me more terrified of metal cans and broken glass than any random zombie I’ve encountered in <em>Resident Evil</em>. Who knew trash could be so scary? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike has always been a powerhouse of the esports betting market, but in recent months, it has become a bigger title than ever before in the space. In the Q3 2024 ‘Esports Betting Monitor’ report published by Abios, it was revealed that Counter-Strike 2’s esports betting ecosystem continued to grow, overshadowing every other esports game in the business.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-horizons">New Horizons</h2>



<p>In the report published by Abios and propagated by Cody Luongo’s Sharpr newsletter, it was revealed that Counter-Strike 2 accounted for a whopping 58% of the entire esports betting handle through Q3 2024. That’s an all-time high for 2024, and it’s representative of the growth of Counter-Strike in the world of esports gambling.</p>



<p>Looking at the stack of games, they’re ordered like this when it comes to betting popularity:</p>



<ol>
<li>Counter-Strike</li>



<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>



<li>Valorant</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>
</ol>



<p>In the last quarter, the most bet-on events included the ESL Pro League, BLAST Premier, and IEM – all Counter-Strike events. League of Legends tournaments weren’t too far behind, though – the LPL, LCK, and LEC all did strong numbers in terms of esports wagering.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar year for League of Legends in general. It was just days ago that <a href="https://escharts.com/news/worlds-series-one-billion-hours-watched" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Charts reported</a> the League of Legends World Championship had hit <strong>one billion </strong>hours of watch time since records began.</p>



<p>Esports betting continues to be dramatically lucrative for the wider industry. It makes up more than half of the market’s revenue and it contributes to some of the most prolific partnerships and sponsorship deals irrespective of the game in question.</p>

<h2 id="h-assault-rifles">Assault Rifles</h2>



<p>The most versatile guns are Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6, as they have the ability to perform at all ranges. According to the official <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel#Shotguns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD Blog</a>, attachments make ARs incredibly versatile. They’re best used at medium-to-long ranges, with easy-to-control recoil and great damage.</p>

<p>Arguably the strongest close-range option, Shotguns destroy anything in their path in close-quarters combat. That said, you’ll need to play in a specific way to perform well with them, as they lack range and accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="h-pistols">Pistols</h2>



<p>Pistols in Black Ops 6 are your go-to option whenever you need to get a quick shot off when your primary weapon needs to be reloaded. As every Call of Duty vet knows, reloading your weapon is slower than swapping to your secondary to secure a kill.</p>

<p>Melee weapons may not be the most popular, but they’re one of the most fun to use in Call of Duty games. You’ll need to avoid long lines of sight and work your way behind enemy lines to take advantage of melee weapons, so play to their strengths to get the most out of them.</p>

It’s an action-RPG based on Chinese mythology and the story <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/knowing-this-lore-makes-black-myth-wukong-way-more-enjoyable">Journey to the West</a>.</p><p>In his 8/10 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, critic <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Mitchell-IGN">Mitchel Saltzman</a> wrote:</p><p>“As GameScience’s debut action game, Black Myth: Wukong is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making Black Myth: Wukong a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs.”</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukongs-physical-ps5-edition-is-up-for-preorder">Black Myth: Wukong (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-xbox-series-x-s-pc">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-player-beats-entire-game-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-with-1-hp-1-fp-and-1-point-of-stamina<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One Elden Ring player has completed an astonishing run through both the base game and expansion Shadow of the Erdtree with one hit point, one focus point, and just one point of stamina.</p><p>Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ainrun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainrun</a> completed their run after more than 20 hours and 900 deaths, sharing the moment they conquered Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss on X/Twitter, below. The feat is a world's first.</p><p>Having just one hit point is an obvious threat, as it means any hit taken, even from the most insignificant enemy or fall, results in death, But having just one focus point, or FP, meant Ainrun couldn't use any magic or Ash of War skills that allow the myriad speedrunning and cheesing strategies deployable in normal runs.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">20+ hours, 900+ deaths on Radahn. World's first 1HP/1FP/1Stam run is finally over. <a href="https://t.co/GFoCFnParw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GFoCFnParw</a></p>— Ainrun (@Ainrun) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ainrun/status/1848393882960040165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But it was the one point of stamina that caused the most problems, they said. Elden Ring, like FromSoftware's previous games, uses stamina for everything. Every use of the shield to defend against attacks, every swing of the player's own weapon, and every dodge out of the way uses stamina. Having just one point of it meant none of those things could be used together.</p><p>"The one HP didn't matter much cause I'm used to no hit runs," Ainrun said in a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/Ainrun/status/1848394358933827842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "The one stamina was the worst part. You cant chain actions like spam rolls or do combos, cause every action takes stamina and goes to the negative.</p><p>"You need to wait a whole second for your stamina to go back to the positive before you can do another action. The one FP meant I couldn't cheese bosses or use Ash of Wars or anything. Just pure movement and parries and self-hate."</p><p>The feat is made all the more impressive given just how hard many players found Shadow of the Erdtree normally. It featured bosses with which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-pushed-the-envelope-on-what-can-be-withstood-by-players-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">FromSoftware "really pushed the envelope" on what the player can withstand</a>, director Hidetaka Miyazaki said ahead of its release. In fact, getting into the expansion even poses a challenge as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">players must defeat an optional boss</a>.</p><p>Those eager to explore every inch of the DLC once in can check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">IGN's extensive guide</a>, which covers <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">Shadow of the Erdtree's new weapons</a>, its various quest lines, and how to defeat those pesky new bosses.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">In our 10/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been looking for a way to jump into Delta Force, the game will be getting a PC Open Beta Test on December 5, 2024.&nbsp; The game was well received during Steam Next Fest, and Team Jade has announced that the tactical shooter will be launching its PC Open Beta Test on December 5. To celebrate the release of the Global PC Open Beta, Team Jade has released a Cinematic Trailer, where you can watch just over four minutes of content to get excited about the title.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force | PC Global Open Beta Cinematic Trailer: Genesis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YY6mxdHdHNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PC Open Beta Test, previously known as Early Access, will bring expanded content to the game, allowing players to experiment with new weapons and operators, as well as new maps, missions, and much more. As the game was so well received during Steam Next Fest, Shadow Guo, Game Director of Delta Force, made a statement about what's next for the title.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to wrap up Steam Next Fest with a bang! On behalf of the entire team, we want to say a huge thank you! Given the feedback and the game's current state on PC, we've decided to release the multiplayer component for PC players ahead of schedule. We're excited to bring a plethora of new content to players, and we hope they enjoy every moment."</p>
<p>While this is an exciting moment for PC players, those on console and mobile will have to wait a little while longer, with Shadow Guo saying that news will be coming early next year. Delta Force is shaping up to be a highly anticipated game, as the title has reached over two million wishlists on Steam alone, making it the 4th <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-reaches-one-million-steam-wishlists/">most wishlisted title</a> on the platform currently. In addition to that, Delta Force topped all three of the official Steam Next Fest charts, with the game being in the top spot on the Trending Upcoming, Popular Upcoming, and Top Demos title lists.</p>
<p>The single-player campaign for Delta Force doesn't have an official release date yet, but it's probable that it will be released sometime during 2025, as that was originally when the multiplayer mode of Delta Force was going to be released.</p>
<p>This is a huge accomplishment for<a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Team Jade</a>, as they previously worked on games such as Call of Duty: Mobile and Assault Fire. Assault Fire has been the most popular Chinese shooter game on PC for the past decade. Delta Force is a major franchise, with the first game being released in 1998.&nbsp; The last title was released in 2009, with the upcoming Delta Force title coming to PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, and Android.</p>

<p>In the last few years, Call of Duty’s campaigns have been woefully short. In 2023, Modern Warfare III was released with a story mode that could be completed in just <strong>three hours</strong>, which always leaves users feeling short-changed. With that in mind, many people are asking the obvious question: ‘How long is the Black Ops 6 campaign?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-black-ops-6">How Long is Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Let’s be honest, everyone cares about multiplayer when it comes to Call of Duty, and <strong>that’s </strong>endless. This time around there’s also a stacked COD Zombies offering, which only serves to increase the number of hours you’ll spend shooting things and exploring this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>But what about the campaign? How long is Black Ops 6’s story?</p>



<p>Here’s what we know.</p>



<p>Treyarch explained that the Black Ops 6 campaign is a) ‘the kind of length of a classic Call of Duty campaign’, and b) ‘slightly longer than Cold War (2020).’</p>



<p>When it was released, Black Ops Cold War boasted one of the shortest Call of Duty campaigns ever, coming in at around five hours. With that in mind, it seems obvious that Black Ops 6 will have a <strong>longer </strong>story for players to explore.</p>







<p>In terms of the average, it’s usually expected that a standard COD campaign will take players around 6 – 7 hours to finish, but it has been wildly varied in recent years.</p>



<p>There are a few things that might make the Black Ops 6 campaign length seem a little shorter. For instance, the game only has one linear ending, and there’s nothing to gain from replaying it to find alternate endings. </p>



<p>Also, this game is more accessible than ever, and the easiest difficulty setting and all the guidance options are expected to make this game <strong>a breeze </strong>unless you’re playing on a harder difficulty setting.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25 – we’ll have confirmation then of how long the campaign is.</p>

Our goal with the character models was to improve the textures as much as we could while ensuring that they blend in with the apocalyptic world. </p><p><strong>Melchiah</strong></p><p>The first of Kain’s lieutenants Raziel must defeat. This battle takes place in the Necropolis where Melchiah chases Raziel down while phasing through gates, making the spectral realm no longer safe. Strategically use the environment to expose Melchiah’s vulnerabilities and use his own devices against him.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Melchiah received a full texture overhaul with darkened skin and a slimier body-feel. The bones and skeletal mapping are now more realistic and gory and his eye color was adjusted to match the original look.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Zephon</strong></p><p>Fought in a dilapidated cathedral, Zephon has evolved into an insect-like creature, fusing with this towering structure. You’ll need to ascend to the highest chambers and become willingly ensnared to be able to confront him. Search the room for any elemental advantages which could aid you in this endeavor.</p><p><em>—Zephon was too desaturated, so we’ve completely repainted his face.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Rahab</strong></p><p>This battle occurs in a flooded abbey. Rahab is fully immune to water, which is lethal to Raziel. Use Raziel’s agility to avoid Rahab’s deadly close-range and long-range attacks by jumping and make use of your newly gained Telekinetic projectile ability to exploit Rahab’s extreme vulnerability to sunlight.</p><p><em>—Rahab’s head has been remodeled, so the eyes now have a reddish glow which gives him a menacing look. We’ve also altered the fangs to look more vampiric and made his skin color a little more gray.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Dumah</strong></p><p>In a desolated fortress, Dumah awaits reanimation. Just like his other brethren, Dumah is invulnerable to any attacks, so Raziel has to be cunning and lure him to a flame powerful enough to melt even the hardest metal, all while avoiding tremendous earthquakes caused by Dumah’s incredible strength.</p><p><em>—Dumah’s armor is now a lot dirtier and has patches of mold and blood all over it (considering he was impaled for centuries).</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kain</strong></p><p>Raziel first confronts Kain at the Pillars where he must be swift and strike Kain three times to gain the Soul Reaver. The second encounter takes place in the Chronoplast, where the tiered arena makes evasion even more challenging. Track your target’s movements closely and make haste to strike him with the Soul Reaver. If you cannot reach him in time, use your Telekinetic projectile to stop Kain from using his powerful lightning attack. The encounter is intense and dramatic, but we won’t spoil how it concludes. Pre-order to find out!</p><p><em>—The models for Kain in both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 needed to be completely re-designed to mitigate textural issues. With the increased polygon count we felt it was important to bring his look a lot closer to the Kain we got to see in the original <a title="Genres > FMV [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/fmv">FMV</a>s, which was a lot more detailed and showed more-or-less what the original intent was for the character. The original model in SR1 was especially limited so now both games have a Kain that looks consistent between the two titles.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Map and Compass Details and Gameplay</strong></p><p>In the original versions of the games, players often found themselves wandering the vast, twisting landscapes of Nosgoth, relying heavily on memory and environmental cues to navigate.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>The introduction of the Map and Compass marks a thoughtful enhancement that blends modern gameplay conveniences with the preservation of the explorative experience the original titles were known for. The Compass gently nudges the player in the right direction without giving away specific details of where to go or what to do next and the Map is more of a reference tool than a guide.</p><p>We also included a collection tracker for any Health and Energy power-ups so that you know if you’ve gotten all of the collectibles within each area. All of the major Nosgoth features are present and accurately condensed based on the setting and gameplay. </p><p>For fans who might feel that these additions are a major departure from the original games, we’ve made sure to incorporate a toggle-off function for the compass. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to its gameplay utility, the map is also a wonderful art piece that was created in collaboration with our development team, community advisors, artists, and designers at <a title="Companies > Crystal Dynamics [150 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cde-entertainment/crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a>. We knew accuracy was paramount, so we worked hard to pull from the original source art, design documents, and clues from game lore. We also incorporated community reviews to ensure nothing had been missed.</p><p>Thanks to these efforts, the map is accurate enough to feature in the new lore reader bonus menu – identifying the location of each lore entry. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>For design direction, Crystal Dynamics designers used a heavily inked approach that sits beautifully with the existing art, creating a stunning new way to visualize the world of Nosgoth. </p><p>The Map and Compass are there to serve as welcome tools for exploration, ensuring that the remastered versions remain both a tribute to the classics and a modernized, more player-friendly experience.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was an early success for Ubisoft in 2024, or so it seemed anyway. It was the first relatively big game to launch this year and it got rave reviews, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco's 9/10 on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action game features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, sales haven't been nearly as positive, at least compared to Ubisoft's pre-release estimates. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to YouTuber Gautoz</a>, who talked to various members of the Montpellier office, there won't be any sequel and the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team is also practically disbanded.</p>
<p><em>You have to understand that internally, the writing was on the wall a few weeks after the game launched at the beginning of the year. By Spring, it was pretty clear – just a few patches, a DLC, and that was it. The more optimistic folks in the core team repeatedly pitched a sequel project, but then it turned into a struggle to get the green light for two DLCs, hoping to change the bosses' minds. But it was obvious that the decision had been made quickly, especially with the need for help on other projects with better sales potential.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft usually has a sales curve like a blockbuster—big launch, but this time, it started lower than expected. I've heard a justification that honestly drives me crazy as a gamer: if you let them make another one, it’ll eat into the long-term sales of this one. I've always thought the opposite; with a good sale on the first one, you could actually boost sales.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The production of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown wasn't exactly an issue—far from it, actually. For instance, there was crunch, but we're talking about a production with a really strong collective spirit, which is pretty different from how Ubisoft usually makes games with 80 to 100 people fully loaded on development, which is pretty small in comparison.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a classic big Ubisoft project, but it was a blessing to try out different organizational models. Some teams, like the gameplay team for example, were set up almost horizontally with a lot of listening and consultation. People felt like they really had a say in the project's direction. Plus, it's worth mentioning that the Prince of Persia team had often allowed people who were totally burned out due to too much time spent on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Somewhere along the way, it also helped some people get back on their feet after tough times in their careers. So these days, the big office reorganization at Ubisoft Montpellier is kind of wiping away the last traces of that team.</em></p>
<p>It is unfortunate since Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is arguably one of the very few critical successes enjoyed by Ubisoft lately. However, the company is now focused entirely on improving its sales, and it was even willing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows out of its scheduled November 2024 release window to avoid jeopardizing its signature franchise. They're also backing out of the Season Pass model, canceling early access, and returning to Steam in three unprecedented pro-consumer moves.</p>

For those who are interested in picking up the headset, you can purchase it for $109.99, with this new version of the headset officially replacing the original model.

Just in time for October, the month when everyone is braving some new horror games.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't planning on using this headset for the Xbox, it has Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity for both PC and mobile devices, which means that players using this headset will be able to switch between devices without any issue, and there won't be endless fiddling around with the Bluetooth settings to try and get your devices to sync up. Additionally, there are no dongles or extra pieces of equipment that you'll need to use in order to get your headset working.</p>
<p>The Xbox Wireless Headset comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-suggests-samsung-and-google-are-developing-a-pair-of-mixed-reality-smart-glasses-instead-of-a-headset/">Qualcomm</a> S5 Gen 2 technology, providing a low-latency wireless connection, allowing for smooth gameplay and perfect communications between teammates.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/22/xbox-wireless-headset-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> for the Xbox Wireless headset, it is noted that for those wanting to use DTS Headphone: X, you may have to purchase additional content and apps to be able to use it. Additionally, the battery life of the headset depends on a number of factors, including the distance from the console, additional accessories, usage, and more.</p>

<p>The Wolf Among Us 2 has not been cancelled at Telltale Games. </p>



<p>The confirmation comes after rumors began to circulate over the last 24 hours that the game was almost to a point where Telltale “might have no choice but to shelve it”.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-not-cancelled-telltale-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Telltale Games assured fans that the game was still moving forward with development.</p>



<p>As a rule, we don’t comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,” the Telltale rep told the outlet. “But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we’re excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The original poster of the rumor has since deleted the claim.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2017, The Wolf Among Us 2 was first cancelled when Telltale Games had to shut down in 2018. Upon the studio’s revival in 2019, the game’s development was restarted. It was planned for a release in 2023, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-out-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed due to development</a> “requiring more time”. Since then, it’s been silent on when the game could come.</p>



<p>The studio did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/telltale-games-allegedly-fires-most-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff a significant number</a> of people in 2023, however, according to former cinematic artist Jonah Huang.</p>



<p>What do you think of the state of The Wolf Among Us 2 amid cancellation rumors? Let us know in the comments or the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

Throne and Liberty, recently published globally by Amazon Games <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-hails-success-of-mmo-throne-and-liberty-after-3-million-players-in-a-week">to huge player numbers on Steam</a>, is now its own game studio.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/tl-1729612090545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Throne and Liberty's global launch is a success, Amazon Games has said.</figcaption></figure></output><p>NCSoft is now split into four divisions: NCAI, Studio X, Studio Y, and Studio G. (Studio X is the studio behind Throne and Liberty.) It’s unclear at this stage what NCSoft’s troubles mean for ArenaNet, the Bellevue, Washington-based studio behind Guild Wars. Earlier this year, Guild Wars 3 was said to have been in development, although work continues on Guild Wars 2.</p><p>Some video games will be canceled, howoever, alongside layoffs via a voluntary retirement program, the co-CEOs confirmed. "Major changes are inevitable for the survival and future of the company, and we promise active support and compensation to those affected,” they said.</p><p>Earlier this month, Amazon Games announced that Throne and Liberty had seen more than three million players in just a week following its global launch. Originally billed as a Lineage sequel, Throne and Liberty is an MMO with PvE and PvP set in a dynamic and seamless world. It suffered numerous delays over the course of a development cycle spanning several years.</p><p>Throne and Liberty finally launched on October 1 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and soon proved a hit on Steam with an impressive player concurrent peak of 336,300. Throne and Liberty remains one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Judging from comments by a veteran Guerrilla Games developer, don't set expectations for the FPS franchise to return anytime soon. The team "needed" to shake things up after Killzone: Shadow Fall launched in 2013, according to art director Roy Postma.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, Postma explained why Guerrilla left Killzone behind and set their sights on what became Horizon Zero Dawn.

Did you have a fine old time in Blackreach, the mazy, Dwemer-built underside of Skyrim's sprawling mountain map? Do you like murdering Ents in slow motion? Do you want to see smells? You might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-axis-unseen">The Axis Unseen</a>, which has just launched on Steam - it's the work of former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile, one of the big brains behind Blackreach.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The Axis Unseen isn't an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, nor is it a work of genre fantasy like Elder Scrolls. It's an open world archery hunting sim, set in a "heavy metal horror" universe, with an appropriately loud soundtrack composed by post-metallurgical maestro Clifford Meyer of Red Sparowes fame.
</p>
<p>
The game's monsters can smell you based on the wind direction, and you can track them based on footprints and blood trails. This isn't some pious exercise in realism, however: you also get a sorcerous bow with arrows that can distort time and change the weather. Arrow effects can be combined, Magicka-style, and there are also unlocks that enhance your senses. "See scent particles," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/">the Steam page enthuses</a>. "Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen." I'm not sure my graphics card can handle colours beyond human comprehension, though the system specs don't look too brutal.
</p>
<p>
I played an early build of The Axis Unseen at GDC's Day Of The Devs this year, and swiftly got myself stepped on by Bigfoot. In the 10 minutes or so before I was stepped on by Bigfoot, I particularly enjoyed the game's shamanistic in-world HUD design, with health, power availability and how much noise you're making visible as glowing glyphs on your wrists and equipment. I wasn't especially blown away by the hunting element, but it's hard to form a clear impression of such delicacies when you're surrounded by game developers bellowing about the afterparty. 
</p><p>
The full game is "20 hours long, more if you're a completionist", according to the Steam page. Graham is reviewing this, I think, or at least, putting together some lengthier thoughts about it. He says he's interested because archery is the only good part of Skyrim, but don't mind Graham - he's always saying things like that.
