            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/american-tabletop-awards-2025-winners-announced-showcasing-industry-variety<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The official awards committee of the American Tabletop Awards 2025 announced their winners. These awards are essentially the US' answer to the prestigious Spiel des Jahres, are intended to represent a wide variety of excellent board games across multiple genres and themes.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://americantabletopawards.com/2025-american-tabletop-award-winners/" rel="nofollow">website post</a>, the committee announced the American Tabletop Awards 2025 winners. As always, the winners span four different categories and are decided upon by a committee of US-based board game pundits, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA</a> president Nicole Brady.</p>

<p>The Early Gamers award is for shorter board games aimed at younger players (roughly 12 and under) and tabletop newcomers. The Casual Games award is for games aimed at general audiences of all ages. The Strategy Games award are a step above casual games, requiring a bit more forethought and consideration. Finally, the Complex Games award are games aimed at experienced players.</p>

In simple terms, the game has you assembling a pirate crew on a ship from a bag of tiles at random. Don't like a certain tile you got? Flip it. It's simple, it's cooperative, and it has an appealing art style.</p>

This is a cooperative poker game created by John Cooper and Kory Heath and published by Thames and Kosmos. In a gameplay system similar to the indie videogame craze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Balatro</em></a>, players work together to pull off heists, represented by the strength of different poker hands.</p>

To Japan</em>, designed by Josh Wood and published by AEG. Flavorwise, the game is about planning the perfect trip to Japan. Players get thirteen rounds split between Kyoto and Tokyo. Once it is planned, players undergo the trip, earning points based on their activities.</p>

<p>It's essentially a modern take on <em>Tokaido</em>, another tabletop experience about traveling through Japan. The committee recognized Let's Go! To Japan thanks to its blend of approachability and challenge.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/american-tabletop-awards-2025-fromage-featured-image.jpg?itok=J_QMIeS5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/american-tabletop-awards-2025-fromage-featured-image.jpg?itok=eXVlfhcu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, the American Tabletop Awards 2025 Complex Games winner was <em>Fromage</em>. This board game was designed by Matthew O' Malley and Ben Rosset and was published by Road to Infamy Games. As the name implies, the game is all about becoming the best cheesemaker in the world. It is a complex blend of worker placement and time management courtesy of a rotating game board.</p>

<p>Plus, as the committee remarks, it gives you an excuse to make constant cheese jokes.</p>

Its first major update, <em>Dawn of the Hunt</em>, arrived last week and quickly led to review-bombing on Steam over difficulty spikes that made the game feel, according to some players at least, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrzxej/this_game_feels_like_a_massive_waste_of_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrzxej/this_game_feels_like_a_massive_waste_of_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like a massive waste of time</a></span>.” Developer Grinding Gear Games released some emergency patches to make the action-RPG less of a slog, but the fallout is ongoing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195150" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="526" data-playlist="195150,196055,196918" data-current="195150"><div><p>Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20607.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“There were some blatant fuck-ups, speaking bluntly,” game director Mark Roberts said during a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VImBtU3amXE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VImBtU3amXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live interview with <em>PoE </em>streamer Zizaran</a></span> on April 8. “Like the minion change was just bad.” He and fellow director Jonathan Rogers both agreed that nerfs to player ally health and power, as well as buffs to enemy survivability, both went way too far. “A lot of it is just Early Access so it’s allowed but, like, we are just firing from the hip a lot here, stuff like that,” Roberts said. “Like let’s just get it in there, see what people think, and if it’s bad we’ll just undo it.”</p><p><em> Dawn of the Hunt</em> went live on April 4 and added a new Huntress class, a bunch of new Ascendancies, more unique loot to chase, and revamped <em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s endgame. But some of that rebalancing ended up leaking out into the full campaign, and overall many players felt the changes made the game’s <em>Souls</em>-inspired combat meat grinder feel way overtuned and unrewarding. Negative user reviews instantly started pouring in on Steam and pushed <em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s rating down into mixed territory. </p><p>“Every boss fight is incredibly longer than it needs to be. Most of the skills do little to no damage,” wrote one player reviewing the game on Steam. “I understand they said they wanted to slow game play down, but I don’t think I will even make it more than 1 week in this league at this point.” Another asked, “how do you have a relatively good first patch then wait 3 months nerf everything and make the campaign a worse experience?” Some fans on the game’s subreddit were similarly apoplectic.<strong> </strong>“I was going to take a day or two off work to play this game,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “But I removed my vacation I had put in. I’d rather just go into work than play this game right now.”</p><p>Grinding Gear rushed into action with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of quick patches</a></span> to try and ameliorate the key pain points, including the new Huntress class being so reliant on a parry mechanic to be effective, as well as more basic complaints around crashes and server disconnects. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A long list of balance changes</a></span> was outlined earlier today to go live across the rest of the week, including making a range of character skills more powerful. “Now that we have a lot of the nerfs out of the way, we can concentrate on buffing things that are not performing well,” the developers wrote. </p><p>In some ways, that sounds like Early Access working exactly as intended, though there are perhaps deeper philosophical issues underlying some of the ongoing community angst around each big new<em> Path of Exile 2 </em>update. Some of that has to do with a clear, overall effort to make a game that’s (somewhat) more approachable to get into than its predecessor, but also decisively more punishing.  Some of it has to do with the fact that people who still love and play the original<em> Path of Exile</em> feel left behind. That game’s next big season was delayed as Grinding Gear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502">tries to get a handle on the sequel</a></span>. </p><p>“I think a running theme with <em>PoE 2</em> in general is that the target to hit is smaller because if we want the combat to be more engaging, then that means there’s a smaller target; it puts more pressure on the balance to be right,” Rogers said during yesterday’s livestream. Some fans were critical of him for appearing “defensive” early on during the interview. He apologized toward the end of the chat and said he had just gotten up on the wrong side of the bed. Roberts added that he actually thought it was one of the duo’s more productive discussions about the game because they came out of it ready to launch over a dozen changes to get <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>back on track. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most widely appreciated games of 2025. It’s a phenomenal medieval RPG with a winding, adventurous story, and it’s packed to the brim with top-tier talent and wonderful, cinematic sequences. That’s what I alluded to in my full review for the game, at least.</p>



<p>I recently had the chance to catch up (again) with Tom McKay at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. We spent a few minutes talking about the success of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is one of the best-selling games of 2025 and will <strong>surely </strong>be up for many awards as the year unravels.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kingdom Come 2's Success Has Been a  Fever Dream for Henry - Tom McKay at the BAFTA Game Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKySVyFMn90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-expectations">‘Huge Expectations’</h2>



<p>I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> about Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is something I’ll never stop boasting about. I hold the series very close to my heart, having poured hundreds of hours into both games and connecting eternally with the characters, particularly McKay’s Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p>When I chatted with Tom at the BAFTA Games Awards, I was eager to gauge just how much this game had defied their expectations:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had huge expectations based on the first game, a ton of effort went into the development of the second game, and they took their time – they put everything they had into it.</p>



<p>They were certainly proud of the product and knew that what they had was a good thing, but you can never predict how people will see that. Ultimately, it’s the players who are the most important reviewers of all.</p>



<p>The kind of energy and support and positivity that we’ve had from the fans has been incredible, and I don’t think any of us anticipated that, I certainly didn’t.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fan base for Kingdom Come has exploded in recent months. It helps that the cast and crew have been immensely supportive of what they’ve produced. The actor behind the iconic Hans Capon, Luke Dale, has taken to streaming the game and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/">become an overnight sensation</a>, racking up thousands of viewers.</p>



<p>I asked McKay how things had changed since we caught up just after KCD2 was announced to the world.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels amazing – it’s <strong>like a sort of fever dream</strong>, really.</p>



<p>I think back to the very beginning of the first game, when I flew out the Prague and had what was essentially a final audition and I met the core creative team for the first time. That just feels like a world away, you know? </p>



<p>It is like a fever dream that we’re actually having this conversation about this game. However, in terms of what they’ve achieved and what they’ve made, Warhorse Studios, that doesn’t feel like a fever dream, because they’re so talented and so passionate, so on that level, it feels totally fitting. </p>



<p>In terms of that, I salute all of them. The reason I’m standing here is because of the work they’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">one hell of a roadmap ahead</a>, with three planned expansions yet to drop this year. Warhorse Studios is also releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode/">Hardcore Mode next week</a>, complete with a new lineup of perks.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of life left yet in KCD2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-dev-assassins-creed-shadows-cat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In my review for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I noted that most of the game’s wildlife is pretty pointless. All across the world, animals roam free with no real purpose or control, and you can’t <strong>hunt them</strong> like you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>One thing I can’t complain about in the animal stakes is the sheer volume of cute kittens, puppy dogs, baby deer, and other adorable creatures scampering around Feudal Japan. I’ve just learned that (at least) one of those cuddly pets is based on a real cat that belongs to a Ubisoft developer.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perks-of-the-job">Perks of the Job</h2>



<p>When you work as a Production Manager on a game, one thing you’ll surely be able to do is immortalise your feline friend for all to see.</p>



<p>That’s what Nik Pantis did while working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Pantis revealed that his stark white kitty, Ghost, is immortalised in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as ‘Bakeneko,’ a one-of-a-kind supernatural yōkai or kaibyō – a <em>ghost cat</em>. </p>



<p>He shared an image of Ghost both in the real world and as the Bakeneko in Assassin’s Creed:</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time a legendary cat has found its way into an Assassin’s Creed game. In 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, a special cat belonging to a fan of the game surfaced – with a very interesting feature. The cat had a natural representation of the Assassin’s Creed logo across its face.</p>



<p>Sadly, the cat passed away before the game was released, but Ubisoft pulled some strings to immortalise a treasured companion.</p>



<p>I’m off to find me a Bakeneko.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>

		<p>Disney Illusion Island will no longer be a Nintendo Switch exclusive, as today it has been announced that the platformer will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th. There will be a physical version released for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with that launching on May 30th in North America and in Europe on June 27th, with pre-orders live now.</p>

<p>When Disney Illusion Island releases for all of these platforms, new free content will be added in the form of Cave Adventuring Scavenger Hunt, which will allow players to unlock permanent upgrades. Disney Illusion Island will support four player co-op allowing the whole cast of characters to be playable at the same time, where players will swim, jump, and run through the different levels. Of course, you can also play the game solo too and you can choose who to play as with those options being Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.</p>
<p>The setting of Disney Illusion Island is the mysterious island of Monoth, which is split into three different biomes. Those areas are the leafy and overgrown Pavonia, the puzzling structures of Gizmopolis and the space styled oceans of Astrono. . All of the cutscenes are fully voiced and brand new characters will be introduced through the game.</p>

Why “boomer”? Well because the people who were playing stuff like <em>Doom </em>and <em>Quake </em>back in the day were likely boomers. So while the games aren’t that old, the name has stuck as a way of lumping a bunch of retro-inspired FPS titles together. As usual, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">video game genres are weird and messy</a></span>!</p><p>Anyway, over the last few years we’ve seen a huge increase in the number of boomer shooters released. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bing-badda-boom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bing-badda-boom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And now Humble Bundle has created a new bundle containing seven boomer shooters for the low price of $16</a></span>. </p><p>Here are the game included in the bundle:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em><strong>Forgive Me Father 2 </strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Turbo Overkill</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>W40k: Necromunda: Hired Gun</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Graven</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Deadlink</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Powerslave: Exhumed</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Serious Sam: Siberian Mayhem</strong></em></li></ul><p> The codes included in the bundle are for the Steam versions of these games on PC. Many of them are perfectly playable on Steam Deck. </p><p>I want to shout out <em>Forgive Me Father 2</em>, a game that is normally $25 by itself and which is a fantastic mix of horror, retro shooter action, and Lovecraftian environments and enemies. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/retro-horror-steam-shooter-nails-that-unsettling-hallow-1847966530?_gl=1*al03qj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDIyMzg5NS43NC4xLjE3NDQyMjYwODEuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/retro-horror-steam-shooter-nails-that-unsettling-hallow-1847966530?_gl=1*al03qj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDIyMzg5NS43NC4xLjE3NDQyMjYwODEuNjAuMC4w">If you enjoy it, you should probably check out the first game, which is also quite good.</a></span> </p><p><em>Turbo Overkill</em> is also a fantastic and very fast FPS that will appeal to people who love to speedrun through <em>Quake</em> while listening to speed metal. Oh, and don’t ignore <em>Powerslave: Exhumed,</em> an odd duck of a game that is a remaster of the PlayStation port of 90s DOS game <em>Powerslave</em>. The PSX port was very different and arguably better, and it’s nice to have it playable on modern consoles and PC. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bing-badda-boom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bing-badda-boom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The boomer shooter bundle ends on April 18</a></span> so don’t wait too long to pick these games up while helping some charities. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Players subscribed to the lowest, or 'Essential' tier of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory-join-playstation-plus-april-lineup/">PlayStation Plus</a> can already grab the three free games for April 2025. Beginning on April 15, 2025, players subscribed to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers can collect their additional free games for the month.</p>
<p>As announced in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>, six games are being added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers, and two classic titles, one from the original PlayStation and the other from the PS2, are being added to the PS Plus Premium classic games catalog.</p>
<p>The six games added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers and above include the 2023 commercial hit Hogwarts Legacy, a brand new puzzle game called Blue Prince, which is launching onto the service tomorrow, April 10. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, EA Sports PGA Tour, Battlefield 1, and Plate Up!.</p>
<p>The two classic titles are Alone in the Dark 2 from the original PlayStation and War of the Monsters from the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Of all eight games in this lineup, Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most high-profile title, but arguably, the most prominent inclusion is the soon-to-release Blue Prince. Reviews for the new puzzle game from developer Dogubomb and publisher Raw Fury went live earlier this week, and so far, it has the highest score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">Metacritic</a> for any game released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's being touted as a new masterpiece, so if you like puzzle games and have a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription, it might be worth checking out. Xbox players aren't being left out either since it'll also be available in Xbox Game Pass when it launches tomorrow.</p>

The second season deals with the mistrust Ellie has formed for Joel after suspecting him of lying to her about what happened after she was put under for the surgery.

                <p>Is there going to be a third The Last of Us game? Given the big success of the first two games and the HBO series, many are expecting more entries in the game series. But Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann says it would take something special for the studio to make a third game.</p><p>He told <a href="https://x.com/NaughtyNDC/status/1909971408546914368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a> that he's currently focused on the TV show--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">which was just renewed for a third season</a>--along with the game he's directing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. He's not ruling out a third The Last of Us game, but he's not confirming it either.</p><p>"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p>Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p>"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-clarifies-comments-on-the-last-of-us-3/1100-6530414/" data-ref-id="1100-6530414">repeating himself here</a>, as he previously addressed rumors of The Last of Us: Part III by saying he treats every game like his last and that the stars would have to align for it to come about.</p><p>In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Reporter Daniel Richtman said <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part III is in production now.</a> For what it's worth, Druckmann has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">he has a story in mind for The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon. As for The Last of Us TV series, Season 2 premieres this Sunday, April 13.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A small update has arrived to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is an adjustment for Call of Duty's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The Terminator T-800 operator's Endo Titanium Core skin is nerfed in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This specific operator skin can be very difficult to see in dark corners of the maps, and according to the patch notes, the skin received a "visibility adjustment to ease target identification."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1909721974395519000" rel="nofollow ">post from CharlieIntel</a> shows a side-by-side comparison of the skin before and after the visual update, which players are already commenting on to express that the change wasn't drastic enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes one of Call of Duty's new Ricochet security features for account linking. Now, any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time. Accounts that fail to complete this step will be locked from use on the PC platform until the security check is completed.

This includes the white-screen bug that prevented some players from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">main story quest for Shattered Veil</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, the update makes changes to the game's ground loot. The DM-10 marksman rifle, Tsarkov marksman rifle, and the SVD sniper rifle are removed from supply boxes and ground loot.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h2>GLOBAL</h2><h3>Ricochet Anti-Cheat</h3><p>We’ve rolled out changes to account linking as described <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">in a blog from #TeamRicochet</a> ahead of Season 03.</p><p>These changes will provide additional security to players with multiple platforms linked to their ATVI ID.</p><p>Account Linking Update</p><ul><li>Any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time.</li><li>Not completing this verification check will lock the account from use on the PC platform only until completed.</li><li>Read more <a href="http://callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">about this policy change here</a>, and visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/keeping-your-activision-account-secure" rel="nofollow ">Keeping your Activision Account Secure</a> periodically for account security best practices.</li></ul><p>From the Ricochet Blog on 3/28:</p><p>Account Linking Changes</p><p>In a proactive effort to protect our players, we’re adjusting account linking shortly after the launch of Season 03. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform. Players will see an in-game notification if this occurs, locking gameplay on the new platform until the authentication has been completed.</p><p>If you receive an email notification about a platform link or login attempt you did not initiate, visit CallofDuty.com to login and immediately unlink the account and update your password.</p><p>Securing your account by enabling 2FA is important, as is making sure you are not reusing passwords for your Activision ID that you would for other apps or websites.

"[Bihldorff] was very quick to say 'no,' like, all options are on the table," said Kinda Funny host Tim Gettys. "Obviously, nothing's confirmed one way or another, but there are many examples of games that are on NSO and can still get them in a different way."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1tV6XowUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the list of examples is small, some include the Blaster Master and Wild Guns. Several NES and Game Boy Blaster Master games are available on NSO. However, the series was rebooted with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blaster-master-zero/" data-ref-id="5000-459308">Blaster Master Zero</a> and is available on Switch. The SNES version of Wild Guns is available on NSO, and the game received an enhanced remaster called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-guns-reloaded/" data-ref-id="5000-454656">Wild Guns Reloaded</a>, which is also available on Switch.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-review/1900-6414506/" data-ref-id="1900-6414506">Wii U version</a> has a bevy of new features and quality-of-life improvements that make it a much smoother experience. However, there will also be improvements to the GameCube version when it lands on Switch 2. Games can receive a resolution boost and faster loading times, as well as online multiplayer functionality.</p><p>There were rumors of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-and-wind-waker-switch-release-rumored-for-2022/1100-6503137/" data-ref-id="1100-6503137">Wind Waker and Twilight Princess</a> being ported to the first Switch several years ago, but those never came to fruition.

            <title><![CDATA[With The Switch 2, Even Nintendo Wants To Trap You In An Ecosystem]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-switch-2-even-nintendo-wants-to-trap-you-in-an-ecosystem.1159755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been about a week since Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct, which showcased the console, its upcoming slate of games, and (<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-direct-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually</a>) the price. Since then, the internet has been buzzing with both amazement and anger, as fans debate whether new games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> are really worth their higher price tags.</p><p>But Devon Pritchard, Nintendo of America’s VP of Sales, thinks games are only one part of the Switch 2 equation. During an interview with her last Thursday at the Switch 2 preview event in NYC, Pritchard repeatedly stressed that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gamechat/?srsltid=AfmBOoouUG-qIzczTbXZ6C3DY1Uuxy3OO9AjZMQQkrhcGCoMHZjHeK6n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameChat</a>, the system’s voice- and video-chatting app, is as important as any game, and justifies the higher prices.</p><p>“The [console’s] price is commensurate with the value that the system provides,” she said when asked about the price increase. “And with these social experiences, the Nintendo Switch 2 provides value.”</p><p>Taken at face value, it seems obvious why Nintendo gave GameChat such a flashy introduction during the Direct, and why Switch 2 development director Sumikazu Ono <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls it the console’s “defining feature:”</a> It’s a new feature that could entice Switch owners to upgrade to the new console, and maybe even buy an official Nintendo webcam. It adds value to the Switch 2 beyond just its expected hardware improvements, like Pritchard says.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could say that about any new feature, including ones that <em>don’t</em> require you to (eventually) pay for an extra Nintendo Switch Online subscription on top of your console. When I asked Pritchard what an ultimately paid service like GameChat offers compared to free apps like Discord, which so many gamers are already using, she said that GameChat’s superiority comes from convenience: “You can imagine that [with third-party apps] your gaming experience starts to involve multiple devices, services, platforms. GameChat is integrated into your gameplay experience.”</p><p>GameChat is indeed integrated into the system — it’s even got its own button. By encouraging players to use their Switch 2 as a singular platform for both gaming and social interaction, Nintendo is integrating players into its ecosystem. That’s simpler to set up and use, sure, but it’s also a strategy that’s become increasingly prevalent over the last decade, as companies like Apple and Google — both of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have spent billions to build their respective ecosystems</a> — compete for market share and users’ time. The more versatile an ecosystem is, the stickier it gets. And the stickier it is, the more money it makes, and the less its competitors do.</p><p>Until now, Nintendo has largely eschewed the ecosystem idea beyond its exclusive games. Take the Switch, which had no real social platforms, barely any streaming apps, few ways to share your screenshots; <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was a gaming machine</a>. Nintendo wants the Switch 2 to be more than that — in Pritchard’s words, the new console has “two propositions coming out of it.” It’s both a gaming machine and a potential social hub.</p><p>GameChat means more time spent with Nintendo, and less with Discord. The Nintendo Music app, as simple as it may be, means more time with Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-nintendo-music-app-is-quickly-becoming-my-main-music-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and less with YouTube or Spotify</a>. The Nintendo Today smartphone app means more time with Nintendo, and less with an independent news outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also give Nintendo a brand new way to advertise its games: When asked why GameChat will succeed when Nintendo’s past attempts at integrated voice-chat — the WiiSpeak and the Wii U Chat app — didn’t, she told me that it’ll function as “word of mouth” advertising, comparing it to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-streamers-are-leading-the-narrative-for-games-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding new games by watching Twitch streamers</a>.</p><p>“For example, let’s say you show me a game on GameChat,” she said. “I’ll have the ability to find my way to the eShop to learn more about that game. And so it provides a unique way to open up the library of titles to players.”</p><p>It doesn’t hurt that once the GameChat free trial ends next March, players are actually going to start <em>paying</em> for those passive advertisements. It’s a win-win for Nintendo — assuming that people use the service, which isn’t a guarantee; I’m not sure how many games a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-FPS livestream</a> can sell.</p><p>But that’s why Nintendo is pushing GameChat so hard. There’s little chance GameChat will dethrone Discord as the go-to voice-chatting app, even for Switch users. But if it does succeed, it could mean an explosion of new Nintendo Switch Online users, and a huge step forward for Nintendo’s ecosystem.</p><p><em>William Antonelli (he/she/they) is a tech and gaming journalist based in New York City.

			<p>Earlier this month, The Molasses Flood (The Flame in the Flood, Drake Hollow, and the work-in-progress Project Sirius) was officially dissolved following its merger into CD Projekt RED. The Boston-based game development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired</a> on October 22, 2021, but the merger did not happen until April 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The Molasses Flood co-founder Daniel Isla, who has now departed from the studio for a new adventure, talked about this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315404560620044288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>, where he also teased Project Sirius, which he described as an 'amazing' The Witcher multiplayer game.</p>
<p><em>To be ultra clear: this is a GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio, and it was long-expected. It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org. Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on.</em></p>
<p><em>On the sadder side -- not to bury the lede -- I've decided not to follow TMF on this transition. So last Monday -- the last day of TMF's legal existence! -- was also my last day at the studio.</em></p>
<p>We don't know a lot about this game, although a few job ads from a couple of years ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-stylized-action-pve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that it would feature stylized visuals, action combat, PvE content, and cooperative elements. Project Sirius was, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> in March 2023, when CD Projekt RED said it would formulate a new 'framework' for the project. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-finalizes-its-new-framework-some-work-seemingly-salvaged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that something might have been salvaged out of the previous work, so everything that Isla and his team have worked on could eventually come to fruition, although we have no idea when.</p>

However, the Switch 2’s Charging Grip, at $34.99, is cheaper than the Pro Controller, which costs $79.99, so the grip is a more affordable way to try out those new buttons.</p><p>However, as with the original Switch’s charging grip, this new grip only charges your Joy-Con while it’s plugged in. “Attach the Joy-Con 2 controllers to the Joy-Con 2 charging grip to use as a classic-style controller – or a handy charging station with the included USB-C charging cable,” the listing says.</p><p>I wish the new charging grip had an included battery. But the ability to charge the Joy-Con while playing and use the new back buttons does make it a step up from the basic Joy-Con 2 grip included with the Switch 2. (Though the back buttons do look quite small.)</p><p>The Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip is scheduled to launch on June 5th alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo has delayed preorders for the console in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">US</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> and hasn’t yet said when they’ll go live in those countries. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But any electronics coming out of China would presumably double in price as Trump ratchets up his tariff bluster. </p><p>The 90-day  pause on other tariffs takes us past the June 5 launch of the Switch, and presumably gives Nintendo and other manufacturers a brief reprieve during which more inventory can be shipped into the U.S. Some analysts feel that a certain level of tariff taxation was already baked into the $450 price, suggesting it might not increase if the pause continues. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">Nintendo said that wasn’t the case</a></span>, however.

And in the days since that event we’ve learned more about the Switch 2 via statements from Nintendo, interviews, and more. For example, did you know that Nintendo confirmed Friend Codes are back, or that the Switch 2 carts will taste disgusting? </p><p>Keeping track of all this new information is tricky. A lot of it has been revealed in various places and across many days and it’s all a bit of a mess. To help, we’ve gone looking for smaller details about the Switch 2 that you might care about, but not be aware of yet. Then we took all those details and collected them into one easy-to-find place. We’re just really nice like that. </p><p>So here are nine things about the Switch 2 that you might not know about. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of Nintendo’s big shifts for the new hardware is the addition of GameChat, a tool for voice chat and sharing video with people on your friends list. But how do they get added to that list to begin with? Still friend codes, it turns out; Nintendo’s annoying method of finding other players that requires entering bespoke strings of numbers into a text field instead of browsing by username. </p><p>Fortunately, there’s now a new, easier way to link up with people that bypasses the tedium of entering friend codes: QR codes. Players can now share them via the smartphone app to easily sync up with one another. Not great, but still much better than the current system. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><p>Sadly, the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 won’t have a musical theme like it did on the Wii.

It was also a pain to transfer it between consoles when upgrading, requiring you to deal with an entirely separate smartphone app. Not so with Switch 2. System transfers have been streamlined for the new hardware, including when going from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p><p>“When you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” hardware director Takuhiro Dohta <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Polygon</em></a></span>. The transfer will include players’ islands. “But the [<em>Animal Crossing</em>] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2,” he added. Millions of players with hundreds of hours cultivating their <em>Animal Crossing</em> retreat can breathe a collective sigh of relief. - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo has decided to not include system-wide achievements in a new console</a></span>.

<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-blue-prince-cost">How Much Does Blue Prince Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blue Prince is full of several mysteries to solve. Image via Dogubomb</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BluePrince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dogubomb community manager</a>, <strong>Blue Prince costs $29.99 / €29.99 / £24.99 on PlayStation 5, Steam, and Xbox.</strong> </p>



<p>Players can purchase the game digitally on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>. Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-blue-prince-free-to-play">Is Blue Prince Free to Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is not free to play</strong>, but it is available as a day-one release on PlayStation Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>



<p>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs $19.99 a month, and it will set you back $14.99 a month to become a PlayStation Plus Extra member. </p>



<p>Blue Prince isn’t the only game coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Plus in April</a>. The fresh batch of PlayStation Plus Extra upcoming titles includes the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports PGA Tour, and Battlefield 1. </p>



<p>As for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;are both day-one releases for the service. And if that wasn’t already enough,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 5</a>&nbsp;is also coming to Game Pass on April 15. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/battle-royale-interest-is-declining-but-fortnite-continues-to-dominate-new-report-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new report from research firm Newzoo indicates the storm may be tightening on the battle royale genre, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is still holding strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Newzoo's PC &amp; Console Gaming Report 2025 has detailed a number of shifts and trends across the industry, and one of those moving trends is the battle royale genre. Newzoo's tracking indicates the battle royale genre has shrunk in playtime, going from 19% of playtime in 2021 to 12% in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Citing its Game Performance Monitor which looks at 37 markets (excluding China and India) across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, Newzoo indicated that as a pair, shooter games and battle royale games routinely account for 40% of playtime. So as battle royale playtime has gradually shifted down, shooter playtime has been going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the 7% shift, the difference within the genre might be the more surprising number. Per Newzoo, Fortnite went from a 43% share of the battle royale genre in 2021 to a 77% share in 2024. Essentially, even as battle royale games trended down, Fortnite ate up more and more of the space within the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Role-playing games have also seen some noticeable growth, up to 13% in 2024 over their 9% share in 2021. Newzoo reported that 18% of RPG time in 2024 was spent in major releases from 2023, spotlighting Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo IV, Honkai: Star Rail, Hogwarts Legacy, and Starfield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Newzoo stated in its report, the fight for attention in playtime and hours is fierce. While games like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Apex Legends carry on, other games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-scape-shut-down-ubisoft-battle-royale">fall by the wayside</a>. Meanwhile, shooters and role-playing games seem to be encroaching on more territory and mindshare. Looking at the success of standouts in those genres, be they Marvel Rivals or Baldur's Gate 3, it's hard to argue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its constant slate of changes, updates, and growing library of gaming experiences and genres contained within it, it might not be surprising that Fortnite has weathered the storm. Still, time passes, and we'll doubtlessly see trends continue to shift as broad audience interests change as the years roll on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
