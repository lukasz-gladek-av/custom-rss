		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> pulled up to the starting line with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/sony-confirm-the-55-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-for-launch/">a broad list of 55 games that were PS5 Pro enhanced</a> at launch. While we’re still waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7’s</a> update, three of these are racing games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">F1 24</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> – and they really do give us the full highs and lows of what PS5 Pro Enhanced games can be with different results thanks to a trio of bespoke in-house game engines.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Enhanced Racing Game Round-up –&nbsp;F1 24, The Crew Motorfest, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHMdNTV6IE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start with The Crew Motorfest, which would appear to be the most straightforward. As a cross-gen game it’s inherently very scalable son base PS5 you had two graphics modes because of this, giving you a pretty much locked 30FPS in Quality mode and generally solid 60FPS in its Performance mode. Visual quality between the two is pretty much identical outside of resolution –&nbsp;a full 4K target in Quality mode, and a dynamic 1440p with FSR2 upscaling in Performance mode –&nbsp;though there’s some more noticeable pop-in for smaller scenery items and shadows in performance mode, arriving at roughly half the distance to the camera.</p>


<p id="caption-attachment-454498">The overhead lanterns pop in at around 215m for PS5 Pro, 175m for PS5 ‘Fidelity’, and 115m for PS5 ‘Performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro ditches the graphics setting, giving you a 60FPS target and a 4K output, but it using PSSR upscaling to enable Ubisoft Ivory Tower to push some higher quality effects, as detailed in the patch notes.</p>

<p>Screen Space Reflections are still used here, as opposed to a jump to ray tracing, but they use higher level of detail to make car bodies and water look more precisely reflective, so you have the same weaknesses that SSR give you, such as driving under a bridge darkening all the road’s surface light reflections for a moment. They’ve also increased the shadowmap cascade detail, to give sharper shadowing. Then there’s a 15% bump in world objects and foliage, aiming to fill out crowds that bit more, upgraded volumetric clouds, and an increase in the number of Image-Based Lighting elements to again improve quality of lighting and reflections. With PSSR, the game should have around 1700p before upscaling to 4K, and the result is sharp and good looking.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454496">Outside of some minor pop in and a softer image, PS5 ‘Performance’ holds up well.</p>
<p>The thing is that this all feels like the RPG looting and perks where you get a 2% upgrade to damage output – it’s a little bit underwhelming. The PS5’s performance mode is really the go-to, with FSR2 working fairly well from a 1080p to 1440p core resolution range, and while that does give a softer image, it’s honestly quite difficult to spot when you’re 2 or 3 meters from your TV. Get closer and the PS5 Pro does take that step forward, but without the highlighted features from Ubisoft, I was very hard pressed spotting the differences outside of sharpness. Not only that, but there are minor dips in performance still, which I could find when skimming through frame-by-frame for points of comparison.</p>
<p>Still, this is a good “does what it says on the tin” kind of upgrade.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moving on to F1 24, and we get meaningful ray-tracing on console for the first time in this series. Ray tracing first debuted with F1 21 on PC, but on console had only ever been featured during non-racing moments. Now with the PS5 Pro, ray tracing is featured in racing for the first time and in a rather refined form as Codemasters have iterated on their EGO engine.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454489">F1 24 ray tracing is best seen during wet races.</p>
<p>First things first, F1 24 has a different meaning to quality and performance than most games. The base PS5 Quality here is the 60fps game mode with a native 4K target, while Performance shoots for 120fps.</p>
<p>Really the only place for the PS5 Pro to go is for adding ray tracing on track. There’s the eye-catching ray-traced reflections, of course, but that’s joined by ray traced ambient occlusion (RTAO) for improved shading, and dynamic diffuse global illumination (DDGI). The main one that’s missing on PS5 Pro during a race is ray traced shadows. Put things together and, depending on the time of day, the lighting and weather, this can all lead to some quite notable changes.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454494">The screen is no longer reflected unrealistically on the wet track surface.</p>
<p>The difference is most strikingly rendered on a very wet race day. The base PS5 uses screen space reflections, but with a wet and shiny asphalt surface, the limits of SSR are shown as it can be excessive and give an over-the top mirroring effect, where reality would be much more subtle. By contrast, ray traced reflections are a little less… shouty, let’s say. Things like billboards on bridges and big screens are no longer reflected in the wet floor as their reflected or emitted light is more rapidly diffused onto the rough surface.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454492">Spot the ray-traced reflections in the glass barriers at Melbourne.</p>
<p>However, there are still more shiny ray-traced reflections on show. You can spot it in places like the reflective protective glass along the pit wall at Albert Park mirroring the grand stands opposite, as opposed to being a white reflection of the sky, as just one trackside example, or on the often shiny front wheel vanes that will now reflect the scenery you’re zipping past. One neat improvement is that, where SSR in bodywork refreshed at 30Hz on PS5, the ray-traced reflections update at 60Hz on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454490">RTAO adds shading to the trees in the track scenery.</p>
<p>RTAO and DDGI both also really help to bring more realistic feeling light and shade to the environment, and this is most noticeable on tracks at night, where trees behind trackside barriers are no longer uniformly lit through all their branches, and even further in the backdrops, you can see the skyscrapers in Singapore lit directionally in a way that fits with a city’s nighttime lighting. During the day, take a comparative peek at covered grandstands and you’ll notice that they’re more shaded inside</p>
<p>You’ll spend a lot of time look at the exhaust and rear end of both rivals and your own car if you race third person, and there’s a lot of complexity to the self-shading and reflections that come from the flowing bodywork, suspension and rear wings that is better represented here.</p>
<p>All in all, there’s a pretty good case for bringing ray tracing into racing games as GPU power is increasing… so long as the same frame rate target can be met. The thing is that, as will be familiar to PC gamers, adding ray tracing is expensive, forcing you to sacrifice resolution and use upscaling to claw back the difference. Without ray-tracing the base PS5 has that native 4K target, but the PS5 Pro with ray tracing drops to a dynamic resolution limit of 1440p and uses Sony’s PSSR to get back to 4K. That’s a high enough resolution to give high quality results, though upscaling problem areas like chain fences can break up a bit in motion, having a more jagged, aliased appearance compared to the temporal anti-aliasing of the base PS5 game… not that this matters at the speeds you’re typically going!</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454491">PSSR and the lower base resolution on PS5 Pro does lead to some more jaggies.</p>
<p>Two further features that the PS5 Pro offers to F1 24, though which we weren’t able to test at this time, were the 120Hz performance mode and an 8K resolution mode – both sacrificing ray tracing to get the job done.</p>
<p>On the whole, F1 24 on PS5 Pro is a success, folding in naturalistic ray-tracing features without impacting underlying performance. It’s an often subtle difference though, and you’re already starting from a 4K 60fps game on base PS5.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we come to the runt of the litter with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. This open world racer had a troubled launch back in September with some spotty performance and image quality to go alongside its launch server issues. PS5 Pro support was added in patch 2 a few days ahead of the console release, but there’s very little song and dance about this. In fact, the messaging in general is rather confusing.</p>
<p>For the base PS5, patch 2 reportedly increases the resolution of the 30FPS quality mode from 1080p to 1440p, though it was meant to be 1440p at launch already. The update also makes certain optimisations to try and steady the frame rate in the 60fps performance mode, though dips are still pretty easy to find.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454493">There is no meaningful improvement for PS5 Pro in TDU Solar Crown.</p>
<p>For PS5 Pro, there’s no apparent difference in the settings –&nbsp;it’s the same Quality and Performance options with no naming distinction or description changes –&nbsp;and there’s no appreciable difference in frame rate, resolution or graphics targets. The PS5 Pro might be able to work at the top end of any dynamic resolution scaling and there’s perhaps some areas where frame stutters have been ironed out, but I’ve also found areas that do still stutter and resolution gains are debatable without pixel counting. There’s also identical visual quirks and glitches in areas glass building faces, shadow draw distances, and plenty more beside.</p>
<p>If you were hoping that PS5 Pro would be some kind of panacea to improve the game’s visuals, it sadly hasn’t been, and KT Racing still has a good bit of work to do if they’re to win over a somewhat disaffected community.</p>

<p>This is definitely a genre that can benefit from higher powered machines, whether it’s helping open world racers pull off 60fps, or feeding more ray tracing reflections, lighting and shading in to provide more realistic, true-to-life visuals. Though this trio of games definitely shows the variance in what different games, engines and developers can and will pull off.</p>
<p>And on the whole, I would say that it’s fair to be a little bit underwhelmed. The Crew looked good in PS5 performance mode, F1 24 was already at 4K 60 so leans on ray tracing to actually add more subtlety to its graphics instead of glitzy reflections that were already there, and Test Drive Unlimited is… well, it’s still in a difficult spot. So… see you for Gran Turismo 7, racing fans!</p>

			<p>Getting a brand new PlayStation 5 in the United States will be cheaper than ever for the next month or so, as the console's MSRP has been officially dropped for the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad</a> shared today confirmed that the MSRP for the console's Digital Edition has been dropped to $379.99 from $449.99. The offer, which has only been confirmed for the US as of now, will be available until December 24th, so there will be plenty of time to take advantage of this deal before it ends.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J40QG4CVaww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an MSRP drop for the console's Standard Edition would have been welcome, those who wish to play retail versions of games still have the option of purchasing the external disc drive, although they may have a hard time doing so at a reasonable price as the recently released PlayStation 5 Pro is lacking a disc drive, leaving those wishing to play retail games with no other options other than buying one. Despite this shortcoming, the mid-generation system is still a worthwhile purchase for those who wish to experience games at their best, offering considerable visual and performance improvements, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</a> More information on the console can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Mark Cerny has crafted something amazing with the PlayStation 5 Pro, introducing new AI upscaling and PSSR rendering techniques that will make existing games look their best. Rather than being a new console entirely, Sony is positioning themselves as the graphics card upgrade that players have been asking for for years.</em></p>

                <p>Disney is currently looking to find some new blood to succeed longtime CEO Bob Iger, and out of the possible candidates, EA's Andrew Wilson is reportedly being considered for the role.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-explores-wider-field-of-candidates-to-succeed-iger-d1876792" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal</a>, Disney is looking at bringing in external candidates, and Wilson's name has appeared alongside other notable business persons like Disney Entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden, Disney parks chairman Josh D'Amaro, ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro, and Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman.</p><p>EA has also had a long relationship with Disney, as the Star Wars games developed by the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-star-wars-games-have-sold-52-million-copies-made-3-billion-and-more-are-coming/1100-6487063/" data-ref-id="1100-6487063">have sold over 52 million copies</a> combined and have generated more than $3 billion in revenue. Currently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-lands-three-game-deal-with-marvel-and-disney/1100-6508744/" data-ref-id="1100-6508744">EA is also working on new Star Wars and Marvel titles</a>, like a Star Wars Jedi threequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-iron-man-game-coming-from-ea-motive-first-of-multiple-ea-marvel-games/1100-6507670/" data-ref-id="1100-6507670">Iron Man</a>, and Black Panther games.</p><p>Wilson has had a long history with EA, serving the company as its CEO since 2013 and as its chairman since 2021. He almost took over as ESPN chairman in 2018--the job ultimately went to Pitaro--and there were reports that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-ceo-pushed-to-consider-bolder-transformation-in-gaming-report/1100-6518346/">Disney was considering purchasing EA</a> during Bob Chapek's reign as CEO. The race to replace Iger comes amidst a series of controversies surrounding the CEO.</p><p>While the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars have seen Disney rake in billions at the box office, the company has been criticized for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-boss-bob-iger-wont-apologize-for-making-sequels-admits-disney-created-too-many/1100-6519579/">relying heavily on sequels over original content</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/she-hulks-tatiana-maslany-slams-disney-ceo-bob-iger-out-of-touch/1100-6516407/">She-Hulk star Tatiana Maslany slammed him</a> for being "out of touch" with workers during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America strike.</p><p>Iger served as Disney CEO from 2005 until 2020 and continued as an advisor to his successor, Chapek. He returned to the position of CEO in November 2022, a role he'll continue to serve in until his contract expires in 2026.</p>

<p>During Gamescom, Techland unveiled Dying Light: The Beast, a full-sized, standalone title that brings Kyle Crane back into the post-apocalyptic action. It has been almost a decade since Crane first appeared on our screens in Dying Light, and in this new adventure, he’s making a bold return.</p>



<p>The Beast is a unique title set in a rural region away from the dense urban sprawls of Harran or Villedor. It’s set 13 years after the events of the first Dying Light game, with players getting to assume control of a twisted, grizzled version of Kyle Crane.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-wanted">Everything We Wanted</h2>



<p>Fans of the original Dying Light were enthused to learn that Roger Craig Smith is returning to play Kyle Crane in Dying Light: The Beast. I got to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sit down with Smith at Gamescom</a> and talk to him about this upcoming game, which is shaping up to be nothing short of phenomenal.</p>



<p>The Beast offers plenty of opportunity to explore a decent-sized world, and Techland has brought back drivable vehicles to make traversal all that more diverse. In this game, Crane has beast-like powers, hence the name of the game, and players can unleash devastating abilities as a result.</p>



<p>Like other Dying Light titles, The Beast will be playable either as a solo player or with up to three friends.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland revealed that Dying Light: The Beast had hit one million wishlists in just 10 weeks, a figure that’s indicative of the hype building behind the game. The franchise director of Dying Light, Tymon Smektala, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Thank you for believing in us and for your enthusiasm for Kyle Crane’s next adventure. Your excitement fuels our passion, and we are committed to delivering an unforgettable experience</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That pre-order performance makes The Beast the fastest-wishlisted game in franchise history, which is nothing short of impressive.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to returning to Kyle Crane’s character when Dying Light: The Beast is released next year? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avatar-disney-concept-artist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday the official social media account of the <em>Avatar </em>series <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zacharyberger.bsky.social/post/3lap2l5awjk2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted some concept art by creature designer Zachary Berger</a>, which was then shared by the main Disney account, putting the image in front of potentially <em>hundreds of thousands </em>of people.&nbsp;</p><p>That's extremely common–big companies use art to hype and sell their stuff all the time–but what made this stand out was the fact that <a href="https://linktr.ee/artofzachary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berger was directly credited</a>. That almost never happens!</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q/app.bsky.feed.post/3lap2l5awjk2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreighcbx76skscshdv6e4x3qiffboguo7xpm5ovhljsrr636ubfqc5e"><p lang="en">Well, this is a career first - so cool to have artwork shared by the official accounts and actually have my name credited!! 🤯🤯🤯Speaks volumes about Dylan Cole, Ben Procter, Aashrita Kamath and the rest of the leadership for making sure the team receives proper credit!!</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q?ref_src=embed">Zachary Berger (@zacharyberger.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q/post/3lap2l5awjk2w?ref_src=embed">2024-11-11T19:30:30.422Z</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Think about it: whenever you see a piece of production art featured in a social media post or a press release or a game announcement at a big televised showcase, all you ever see is the art. You never know who made it, whether it was created by an individual or a small team (or even a studio).&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't an accident! The companies who own these games never bother to credit the artist, because the art isn't seen as <em>art</em>. It's a brick, a piece of company property, which is why even <em>years </em>after a project is finished--or thrown in the bin before it can even reach that point--<a href="https://aftermath.site/most-video-game-artwork-will-never-be-seen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artists working in video games aren't allowed to share things they've created</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In this rare exception to the rule, Berger tells us the crediting was likely down to the fact that many of his bosses on the project come from an art background, like production designers Aashrita Kamath and Dylan Cole. "I have been working in the entertainment/film industry for around a decade and a half, and this has NEVER happened to me", Berger says. "It is an incredible reminder that we work with an amazing group of people who genuinely care about their team."</p><p>So this is cool! And if Avatar and Disney can do it, then anyone can do it, including big games publishers and marketing companies. More of this please!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games has released a half hour documentary all about its upcoming game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>South of Midnlight was first revealed in June last year, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-developer-reveals-south-of-midnight-at-xbox-showcase">eye-catching and atmospheric stop motion trailer set in an alternate version of the American Deep South</a>. Described as a "fantastical" and "macabre third-person action-adventure", South of Midnight will place players in the role of a young Weaver named Hazel. And it is Hazel that this newly-released documentary has been named after.</p>

<p>Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary debuted today, and offers a fresh look at gameplay, as well as interviews with the cast and crew, who share more on behind-the-scenes processes and the game's inspiration.</p>
<p>Speaking in the documentary, creative director David Sears reflected on his own childhood, and his sense of exploration and discovery. His imagination led him to start creating his own adventure stories, as he made his way through the world around him. These stories often featured fantastical creatures and monsters.</p><p>It is this sense of adventure and discovery that Sears wants players to feel with South of Midnight. "The genesis of [South of] Midnight was my desire to create a love letter to the South," Sears said. As such, the creatures that Hazel will meet in South of Midnight have been inspired by folktales and urban legends from the South.</p>
<p>"Every region [in South of Midnight] has a distinctive creature, and they rule entirely," the developer said. "Each kingdom is structured so that you understand 'how did a creature become a monster'."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the landscapes are also inspired by real places found within the American Deep South such as New Orleans, with art director Whitney Clayton saying these locations are almost characters themselves.</p>
<p>As well as Sears, Ahmed Best - best known for playing Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars - also features in South of Midnight's documentary. Best serves as the game's performance and voice director. He and the cast note <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-of-midnight-developer-ensured-its-black-heroine-was-created-by-black-women">how important representation is in games like South of Midnight</a>. "When I think about how many games are set in the South with a strong Black female lead, I don't recall that many," said Hazel actress Adriyan Rae. "That in itself shows how important this is." </p><p>"I think it's really cool that a little Black girl could cosplay Hazel with the hair that is growing out of her head," added writer Zaire Lanier. "It is nice to see yourself reflected in a piece of media, and not in a way that feels sterotypical or inauthentic."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-og-returns-as-a-permanent-game-mode-next-month.1033656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-og-permanent-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that the popular&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG game mode is coming back, and this time, it won't be a temporary mode, so you'll be able to ask your friends "where we droppin?" whenever you like.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Epic reveals that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will return on December 6th, and that it's "here to stay". You'll be able to "explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons".</p>

<p>It sounds like the new, permanent version of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will function in a similar way to when this mode appeared as <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-drop-back-into-battle-royale-chapter-1?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">part of the game's fourth season last year</a>, focusing on multiple seasons rather than a single point in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s history.</p>

<p>Epic had already announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-will-bring-back-og-in-2024-after-it-shattered-records-with-100-million-players" rel="nofollow">would return at some point</a> this year following the original OG run <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-achieves-biggest-day-ever-with-447-million-players-following-return-of" rel="nofollow">shattering player records in November 2023</a>. They had not, however, revealed that it would be a permanent mode rather than a limited-time seasonal affair.</p>

<p>In any case, if you and your friends want to relive the glory days of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>(assuming you consider the original seasons to be those glory days, of course), then you now know when you'll be able to jump in and do just that.</p>

<p>OG&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>arrives on December 6th, presumably across all platforms on which the game is currently available. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s an indie horror game focusing on body horror and possession but with far more action-combat than most horror titles, making it easily accessible and approachable for those who don’t often lean into the genre. It’s not altogether terrifying, thanks to the ability to ground-stomp and slash your enemies using powerful, blood-based skills. Still, the horror elements are there, sometimes leaving you desiring more. More horror, more combat.</p><p><br>To that end, there are a number of other games with similar mechanics, gameplay style, and feel that could scratch the itch you’re feeling after completing <em>Slitterhead</em>. Here are a few recommendations! <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-recommend-id="image://bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of villagers move to attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of villagers move to attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-recommend-id="image://bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of villagers move to attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When combining horror and action, nothing quite compares to <em>Resident Evil 4</em>. It’s far less terrifying than much of the franchise, primarily thanks to the ability to gun down every villager and monster you encounter. </p><p><br>But just because you’re playing as Leon Kennedy and have a handgun and shotgun doesn’t mean you’re immune to fear. <em>Resident Evil 4</em> occasionally ramps up the terror with a few notable jump scares and eerie setpieces that immerse you in its uncanny story. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-recommend-id="image://6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magical streams of light emit from a characters hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magical streams of light emit from a characters hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tango Gameworks</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-recommend-id="image://6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magical streams of light emit from a characters hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like with <em>Slitterhead </em>and <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> doesn’t simply thrust you into a terrifying world and ask you to survive. It provides you with abilities and weapons to fight against ghosts and supernatural happenings across the city. Unfortunately, the ability to launch elemental abilities from your fingertips doesn’t always ease the tension. Early in the game, you’ll wander through an abandoned hospital, and it’s downright terrifying.</p><p>The ability to become more powerful by upgrading your skills helps turn the tide of battle. However, that eerie tension that stems from unseen supernatural mishaps never lets up throughout the campaign. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-recommend-id="image://9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a destroyed piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character looks at a destroyed piano." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pieces Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-recommend-id="image://9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a destroyed piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At its core, <em>Slitterhead </em>is a story-driven experience. While the combat is a nice break from the usual pace of horror titles, those who connect with the story side of the game will likely want more on that front. In steps <em>Alone in the Dark</em>. The recent 2024 reimagining didn’t review well initially but has since earned a small following for its psychological horror elements, puzzles, and action. </p><p><br>It helps that David Harbour (<em>Stranger Things</em>) and Jodie Comer (<em>Free Guy</em>) play the main characters, allowing players to immerse themselves further in the story-driven horror experience. Of course, if you’re not a fan of puzzle-heavy gameplay, then you might not click with this one as intended.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-recommend-id="image://5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bloody nurse approaches the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bloody nurse approaches the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bloober Team</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-recommend-id="image://5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bloody nurse approaches the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What else can be said about <em>Silent Hill 2</em>? The recent remake is one of the most well-received survival horror titles in recent years, and considering the number of hits we’ve had in the past twelve months, that’s saying something. If <em>Slitterhead </em>didn’t scare you, but you’re craving terror in your life, please play <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. The sound design alone is enough to give you goosebumps, and the more action-oriented combat does help draw in new crowds.</p><p>If you’re brave, play it at night with the lights off. Otherwise, I won’t judge you for playing during the day. It’s a highly immersive remake that’s more approachable than the original titles, but retains all of its essence.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-recommend-id="image://81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nero attacks a group of demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nero attacks a group of demons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-recommend-id="image://81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nero attacks a group of demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One thing I genuinely enjoyed about my time with <em>Slitterhead </em>was the feeling you get when facing down one of the grotesque enemies, then whipping out a set of blood claws to tear it to shreds. You felt powerful at times, and I think <em>Devil May Cry</em> captures that intense, action-oriented feeling fantastically. While it does feature a few horror elements, it’s not about the fear; it’s about slaying demons in the most imaginative and bombastic manners imaginable. </p><p><br>Personally, I’m not a fan of the story or dialogue in <em>DMC</em>, but to each their own. Nothing quite compares if you’re after pure action-packed scenes with over-the-top violence!  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-recommend-id="image://leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="2B looks past the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="2B looks past the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Platinum Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-recommend-id="image://leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="2B looks past the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once more, while leaning into the action aspect of <em>Slitterhead</em>, we have <em>NieR</em>: <em>Automata</em>. It’s certainly not a horror game unless you’re terrified of machines. If you are, you’ll be happy to learn that <em>NieR </em>allows you to wield various weapons and attacks to smash those machines to bits. It’s a satisfying albeit odd gameplay loop that, once it clicks for you, it’ll stick with you for quite some time.</p><p><br>One thing I wanted from <em>Slitterhead </em>was larger environments to explore, and I think <em>NieR </em>perfectly nails that aspect and its combat. It’s just all-around satisfying.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-recommend-id="image://ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mutated giraffe clings to the ceiling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mutated giraffe clings to the ceiling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Clapperheads</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-recommend-id="image://ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mutated giraffe clings to the ceiling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Body horror is one of the more unsettling horror techniques used to terrify and leave a lasting impression. It’s bad enough when it’s a human, as in <em>Slitterhead</em>. In <em>Zoochosis</em>, it’s animals, and there’s something far more terrifying about a giraffe splitting apart and scrambling up a wall like a spider.</p><p><br>While <em>Zoochosis </em>doesn’t receive the same recognition as most of the titles on this list, being an indie horror project, it does nail the atmosphere and grotesqueness I think <em>Slitterhead </em>fans will enjoy.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's too early to render a final judgment about that, but so far, one analyst says that Black Ops 6 wasn't hurt at all by being on Game Pass.</p><p>"Call of Duty engagement following the release of Black Ops 6 can only be defined by the term 'bonkers,'" Circana analyst Mat Piscatella wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3laottx5tak2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>. "We've yet to see anything like it in our engagement tracking data... There's been an ongoing debate about Game Pass and its impact on sales and it's never been settled because... it depends. Sometimes it helps sales (especially through virality), sometimes it hurts. After two weeks, my take on this one is that it may not have helped, but it also sure didn't hurt."</p><p>According to Activision, Black Ops 6 had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">the highest opening weekend numbers</a> for any game in the franchise among total players, total hours played, and total matches. Treyarch associate creative director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-on-game-pass-helped-bring-back-lapsed-players-activision-boss-says/1100-6527653/" data-ref-id="1100-6527653">Miles Leslie credited Game Pass</a> for the resurgence in interest in the long-running franchise among lapsed players.</p><p>"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long--I've been working on it for 16 years," said Leslie. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p>One of the promises that Microsoft had to make in order to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard was a deal to keep Call of Duty games on PlayStation consoles for at least a decade. Activision hasn't released its sales figures for Black Ops 6 yet, but putting it on Game Pass seems to have accomplished the company's goals for the franchise. At least for now.</p>

                <p>Prime Video's upcoming video game anthology TV series Secret Level features an episode dedicated to Sony's ill-fated multiplayer shooter, Concord. Series creator Tim Miller reflected on the game's struggles in an interview, saying he can't wrap his head around why the game didn't succeed. He also discussed how the Concord episode of Secret Level "turned out really well."</p><p>"There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on Concord," he told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>. "I honestly don't understand why it didn't work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that."</p><p>Secret Level's Concord episode could be the last time Concord appears anywhere in an official capacity, and if that's the case, Miller said he's happy with the episode his team made.</p><p>"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show, because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters," he said. "If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."</p><p>Secret Level is an anthology series similar to Miller's previous show, Love, Death &amp; Robots. There are 15 episodes in all, including installments based on franchises like Mega Man, Pac-Man, The Outer Worlds, and PlayStation in general. The series premieres December 10 on Prime Video. The episodes feature the voices of Keanu Reeves, Arnold and Patrick Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Luna, Claudia Doumit, and Merle Dandridge, among others.</p><p>Concord launched in August for PlayStation and PC, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">failed to find an audience</a> and Sony made the dramatic decision to shut the game down and offer refunds. Its developer, Firewalk, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">since closed.</a> Going forward, Sony's management has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-talks-concord-failure-and-the-hard-lessons-learned-from-it/1100-6527647/" data-ref-id="1100-6527647">implemented new procedures to help ensure something like this doesn't happen again. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-famously-mute-link-almost-spoke-in-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>At one point, Nintendo's famously silent lead Link was going to have lines of dialogue in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. However, the developers ultimately agreed it didn't feel right, even though in Echoes of Wisdom, Link isn't the main protagonist.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23485">Famitsu</a>, Echoes of Wisdom directors Satoshi Terada and Tomomi Sano, along with series producer Eiji Aonuma, shared more insight into this year's release. The developers noted that traditionally, the lead in a Legend of Zelda game has remained mute, and this typically means Link.</p>

<p>In Echoes of Wisdom, the series' namesake takes the lead role, and therefore this time it is Zelda who doesn't have any lines of dialogue. This opened up the possibility that Link could finally share some words of wisdom with players, and Aonuma admitted "at first" the green-clad hero was indeed talking (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/link-was-going-to-speak-in-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-but-nintendo-thought-it-didnt-feel-right/">VGC</a>).</p><p>Terada added he "let Link talk a little bit" when work on the Switch title began. However, it didn't stick, and Terada noted no matter what he made Link say, at the end of the day, it "just didn't feel right".</p>
<p>"Link would never speak like that," Aonuma furthered. "It felt really strange. Nobody knew what Link would say - that's only natural, because he's never spoken before."</p>
<p>To get around this, the Echoes of Wisdom team instead concocted a story which explained why Link is silent, even though he is not the player character. Early in the game, Zelda can come across a journal entry written by Impa's brother, Lueburry. Here, Lueburry explains that Link was "one of the kids" who had been "stolen away" by the strange rifts that had opened up across Hyrule, setting in motion much of the game.</p>
<p>According to this entry, "all of the kids taken by the rifts" had lost something, and in Link's case, this was his ability to speak.</p>

<p>Echoes of Wisdom is not the only Legend of Zelda game to give a reason to Link's silence. In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, Link can read Zelda's diary when making his way through Hyrule Castle. In her writings, the princess said she had slowly managed to get Link to open up to her, but he "feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden". This "has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings", Zelda writes.</p><p>"I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..." the Breath of the Wild diary reads. "Everyone has struggles that go unseen by the world... I was so absorbed with my own problems, I failed to see his. I wish to talk with him more and to see what lies beneath those calm waters, to hear him speak freely and openly... And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare my soul to him and share the demons that have plagued me all these years."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most highly criticized books from 2014's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> release is the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. This book meant as a resource for DMs to craft their own worlds and adventures had issues with it's structure as well as efficiency of contents leading to a book that was cumbersome to get through. Now that we have our hands on the 2024 DMG how much of an improvement is it?</p>

<h2>Running A Game</h2>

<p>The first two sections of the DMG focus on running the game. The basic things that every DM should know and the rules and resolving outcomes. It might seem smart to begin at the beginning, but when the 2014 rulebook launched potentially new DMs into the rules with the pantheon of Gods this revised layout is great.</p>

<p>DMs will be taught what they need – players, dice, ways to make notes – and the preparation tools for running a session. Much like the revised <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed2ad5c2-7b7b-4a5a-84ff-eb15f1121885" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow"><em>Player Handbook</em></a> the DMG also includes examples of play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-running-the-game.jpg?itok=VgpNwqNG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-running-the-game.jpg?itok=f6Kr693O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These scripted session provide an example for the potential DM reading to not just understand what they need to be aware of, but also why they're making those choices. As the party heads into a dangerous location asking something simple like "Whose leading the way" doesn't just help the players, but it also means if that hidden monster is to jump out who will be the one getting ambushed.</p>

<p>This section also highlights how differently something can be ran at a table. This is very important, especially for new DMs, as you don't want to fall into the trap that there's one perfect way to run a D&amp;D game but instead try out a few different methods and see not only what works well for you, but also your table.</p>

<p>As this portion of the book continues there's an excellent balance of offering the DMs a wide variety of possibilities to pick from while also letting them know that they don't need to offer players the world. There are limits that DMs need to know to set, whether that be content limits or calming down disruptive players. I spoke about some of the good ways that the PHB subtly taught that DMs can say 'no' to a player while still enabling a fun game and it's in this section that you'll also learn that players should be respectful of you and your efforts.</p>

<p>This approach to teaching DMing, first in the tools you'll need and how to run the game, to the different expectations you should understand and accept for yourself but also all of your players is an excellent tact. It starts small, building up the game from the ground, without scaring a new DM with any big-picture ideas from the get-go.</p>

<p>This DMG offers a LOT of different tools for DMs to fill their worlds with entertaining objects and obstacles. Here you'll find instructions for creating items for players to interact with like magic items and spells, as well as elements of the world like gods and settlements.</p>

<p>The range of things to learn, and a variety of their permutations was incredible. All of the things you could think you would need to build up a session or a world are present, and so many other things you might not have ever thought about. Want to run a chase sequence but need mechanics for it? What about if the magic potion wasn't brewed correctly and has a side effect? How should I balance the damage of a trap of my own design?</p>

<p>Most of these sections also have context for premade ideas, like traps, and then how to build them yourself. The DMG continues its methodology of showing you something to prompt your creativity, and then handing you the tools to carry your creation to the finish line.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-map-creation.jpg?itok=BrO0dxol 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-map-creation.jpg?itok=8Fi8aNw- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Building Your Own Adventures</h2>

<p>Forty two pages of the 2024 DMG are dedicated to the creation of Adventures, the generic term for a one-shot/smaller group of sessions, and for full-on Campaigns. Each of these sections details how you should go about creating the premise for the journey, how you can make the characters relevant to the world, and how you can plan encounters to be driving the plot forward.</p>

<p>This is a must-read section for DMs of any level of experience. Does well to explain and highlight the collaborative nature of storytelling in D&amp;D, not just an adventure for the DM to write for the party to read but how they can all influence the world that they'll be joining.</p>

<p>This section also highlights important aspects of planning for multiple avenues of problem solving and how to get players more invested.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-greyhawk.jpg?itok=hh2ISjNc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-greyhawk.jpg?itok=NXAPNtbl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I also appreciated how it demonstrated that you could use the book to build a competent and fun adventure, and then string it to another, and another, and another to create a campaign that successfully builds upon itself, but it fun for everyone the whole way. It's not just about the destination or the journey, but both.</p>

<h2>Campaign Setting, Some Assembly Required</h2>

<p>A campaign setting for Greyhawk has been included as a reference for the DM to craft adventures within. This is a great setting off point.</p>

<p>This section gives a good overview of the regions and major locations of Greyhawk as well as cultural information like local gods, and a map of the world. It feels like a nice blueprint for any of the adventures that reading through the prior segments could be built up from.</p>

<p>That being said this isn't going to be a comprehensive guide to the ins and outs of Greyhawk, a DM will still need to do a lot of fill up this world as their players continue to progress through it.</p>

<h2>Bastion Sweet Bastion</h2>

<p>The final major section details Bastions, a returning mechanic from older editions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> that allows the party to create a "home base" that they will likely call home between adventures. Bastion's can be introduced as early as level 5 and will continue to grow with the party.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-bastions.jpg?itok=I7rJhOYi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-bastions.jpg?itok=rKh595mq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is a really fun way to allow your party to have a piece of the world to call their own, something that players of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76148372-10c1-43b3-929d-4f8aa273a684" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-waterdeep-dungeon-of-mad-mage-board-game-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em></a> might be familiar with but with a whole lot more practical uses.</p>

<p>Bastion's start as a blank slate, but can be leveled up with different facilities that can offer all kinds of amazing effects. A meditation hall that can offer advantage on saving throws, a workshop to crate new tools, or a place to craft Spell Scrolls.</p>

<p>This adds further to the idea that was important in shaping the adventure, it's not just a story for the DM to write, but a place where all players are collaboratively able to craft a world and adventure together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-curses.jpg?itok=RoQKWDAr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-curses.jpg?itok=AEaZD9EK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Dungeon Master's Guide 2024</em> Review | Final Thought</h2>

<p>The <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> has managed to completely eclipse it's predecessor and become exactly what this book is meant to be, a guide (and best friend) to the Dungeon Master. Actually playing the game will be on your shoulders to do, but this book offers everything you need to know before become a DM, clear instructions not just how to run a game but the variety of ways a game can be run, and mechanics behind almost everything that your players will interact with in the world.</p>

<p>It's laid out well, features plenty of alternative ways of learning, and is quick to reference those minor details mid-game. This does feel like an upgrade in all ways, while you might not want to pick up the new PHB immediately, the DMG is definitely a must purchase for a DM planning their next session.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium has been acquired by Swedish entertainment conglomerate Modern Times Group, and the amount for which the studio was acquired may well surprise you.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.mtg.com/press-releases/mtg-acquires-plarium-developer-of-global-1-mobile-rpg-raid-shadow-legends-and-strengthens-mobile-gaming-position/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a press release</a>, MTG (that's Modern Times Group, of course, not&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>) acquired Plarium for a staggering $620 million, of which $20 million will be deferred to 2026.</p>

<p>That goes to show just how huge the mobile gaming business still is (although, of course,&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>is also available on PC). We're not quite in the realms of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division" rel="nofollow">Take-Two's monumental Zynga acquisition</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's huge Activision Blizzard merger</a>, but $620 million is not to be sniffed at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raid-shadow-legends-developer-acquired-combat.jpg?itok=9RDRq_Sp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raid-shadow-legends-developer-acquired-combat.jpg?itok=62ml8zur 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>is big money, believe it or not.</figcaption></figure><p>The amount for which Plarium was acquired might sound like a lot, but as MTG points out, the studio "generated $613 million in revenues" between September 2023 and September 2024, so the purchase is worth roughly one year of Plarium's revenue.</p>

<p>The group says that Plarium's "tech and deep expertise in live-ops, marketing and monetization" will benefit its "performance over the long term", and that the acquisition will "substantially improve MTG's already strong cash flow generation".</p>

<p>If you're only familiar with&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>from interstitial ads and sponsorship deals, then you may not know just how big a deal it is, but suffice it to say that the game does pretty well for itself financially.</p>

<p>Back in July 2022, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/youtube-meme-raid-shadow-legends-passes-1-billion-milestone" rel="nofollow">passed $1 billion in overall revenue</a>, and while that doesn't quite put it on the level of a mega-hit like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-has-worlds-first-10-billion-dollar-mobile-game" rel="nofollow">Tencent's&nbsp;<em>Honor of Kings</em></a>, those are certainly big-league numbers.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what MTG's acquisition of Plarium yields, but it's unlikely to change the latter's business practices in any meaningful way. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>"Where’s my Neo-Volkite pistol, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>?" was my perhaps slightly ungrateful reaction upon booting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game up after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-rolls-back-difficulty-changes-that-made-fighting-xenos-intense-and-stressful">the previous patch</a>. "I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">roadmap</a>, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.</p>

<p>Patch 4.5 - which you can read about in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4472730495692571054">detail here</a>, if my whimsical summaries aren’t fucking good enough for you - indeed adds the Neo-Volkite pistol. It’s a new sidearm for the Assault, Vanguard, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> classes, and it’s described as "a powerful thermal ray weapon." As per the above trailer, it differentiates itself from other weapons by firing a continuous beam of hot. I’m a big supporter of any gun that makes me press the triggers less, especially if I’m already hammering the parry button like a maniac.</p>
<p>Alongside the pistol, there are also a few tweaks to other weapons. These include:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Plasma Incinerator</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly reduced amount of heat generated by normal and charged shots for versions:</li>
</ul>
<p>Master-Crafted - Alpha</p>
<p>Salvation of Bakka - Alpha</p>
<p>Gathalamor Crusade - Alpha</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause several versions not producing heat at all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolt Sniper Rifle</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire rate increased from 50 to 60 rounds per minute.</li>
<li>Headshot bonus increased from x2 to x2.5.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Occulus Bolt Carbine</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope added</li>
<li>Headshot bonus increased from x1 to x1.33</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolt Carbine (SMG)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted damage falloff curve: Base damage increased by 50% for the first 10 metres, after that, the damage drops to the original pre-patch value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Auto Bolt Rifle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Max ammo increased by 1 magazine for each version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also a few bug fixes, but that’s more or less it for this one. We’re still due some new enemies next year, and based on the correct consensus that the brick spongehouses of Tzeentch aren’t all that fun to fight, I very much hope we’ll eventually get some orcs. Space Marine 2 is great, but god knows it could use just a crumb of levity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/slitterhead-creative-director-keiichiro-toyama-muses-on-his-unique-mix-of-influences<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the director behind the original Silent Hill and the Siren series, it's probably not surprising that Keiichiro Toyama's first game from Bokeh Game Studio is a return to horror. Developers striking out to make their own studios have repeatedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-studios-raises-25-million-for-its-debut-rts">returned to genres</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they're already known for—sometimes because they were ideas they'd been noodling on before they left.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, Toyama explained he'd been thinking about the concept before his departure from Sony, which followed the closure of Japan Studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet this game about supernatural monsters taking over humans and hiding in plain sight until their grotesque forms burst out from the head to devour their victims' brains is not just a retread of the past. Although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slitterhead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has you starting off weak and struggling to survive against its horrifying monsters, it quickly unleashes a diverse cast of characters that have the power to not just fight back but actively hunt them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"My original inspiration wasn't to survive the threat of the Slitterheads, but to be able to overpower them with supernatural abilities and skill," Toyama explains. That's revealed early on in the game when, as a mysterious spirit, later referred to as Night Owl, you're able to possess and body-hop between different NPCs but eventually encounter "Rarities," humans who the spirit is able to create a unique bond with and grant their conscious host unique abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of his unusual influences, Toyama mentions his affection for seinen manga, in particular Tokyo Ghoul, whose protagonist becomes a half-ghoul who then also must consume human flesh in order to survive. However, the book the concept had sprung from goes further back, Liaozhai Zhiyi's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, a collection of short stories written between the early 1670s and early 1700s. One of these short stories introduces the Yegouzi, a supernatural creature with the body of a human and the head of a dog that eats human brains. "I had borrowed the idea and thought the contrast of having them disguised as humans in a crowded city would be a good setting for a horror-themed game."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Slitterhead's "><span>Slitterhead's </span>setting is inspired by 90s Hong Kong</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That crowded city in question is Kowlong, a fictional version of Hong Kong, with Kowloon Walled City as its key inspiration. A densely populated urban setting is certainly unexpected given that horror tends to take place in more remote and isolated environments, but it makes sense for a game where players can jump between and control a multitude of hosts where the whole city is essentially able to fight back against the enemy hidden among them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Demolished in the early 1990s, Kowloon Walled City has reached a mythical status over the years, depicted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shenmue II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the inspiration behind the location in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stray</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It has undoubtedly endured in Toyama's imagination even when he had visited Hong Kong for on-site research. "I had a sense of regret that I wasn't able to see the city as it once was, so the desire to bring this unique setting to life had always been there," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If anything, it's Hong Kong cinema from the 1990s that served even more inspiration, and perhaps why Kowlong also takes its design from the still-present Kowloon City, iconic for its neon signs and high-rises that caused planes to fly over dangerously close during their descent to the old Kai Tak Airport.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bokeh Game Studio.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Exploring the perpetual night time of Kowlong's chaotic streets, dark alleyways, and seedy underbelly stacked on floors of cramped and rundown housing conjures images of Chungking Mansions depicted in Wong Kar Wai's 1994 film Chungking Express, while the introduction of rarity Alex riding on a motorcycle through a tunnel even feels like a callback to a scene in 1995's Fallen Angels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet while one might expect Kowlong to be depicted as an open world city, the team was also getting to grips with learning the ins and outs of Unreal, having long been used to working with Sony's proprietary engines. Although many open world games are made with Unreal, a key issue had been with memory due to all the NPCs populated the city. "Due to memory load, we opted for a mission-based structure," says Toyama. "I believe this decision actually allowed us to have more control over the pacing of the game progression."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reworking past ideas into Slitterhead">Reworking past ideas into Slitterhead</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For all the bold choices </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slitterhead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> opts for, from a diverse ensemble with equally diverse abilities and movesets, such as Tri, an Indian housemaid who fights with oven mitts, or Betty, an old lady evidently named after the late Queen of England, who fights with a cane, there is nonetheless much of the DNA from Toyama's past works the team was able to learn from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ensemble cast makes it something of a spiritual successor to Siren, including the first game's use of a time-looping structure as the story progresses. The ability to switch between character perspectives through possession is essentially an evolution of that series' sightjacking mechanic, which even has an explicit nod in certain moments when players can sightjack to see from a Slitterhead's point of view in order to track down their location.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet perhaps the most unusual inspiration isn't from horror at all. Toyama says, "The experience with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gravity Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was valuable for this project, as we'd drawn on level design that utilizes verticality, as well as the experience of having numerous interactive NPCs." On reflection, the ability to possess and hop between NPCs in order to reach paths blocked by a fence or up to a rooftop isn't all too dissimilar and unusual as getting around by changing the directional pull of gravity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bokeh Studio</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This also marks Toyama's reunion with composer Akira Yamaoka since the two were employed by Konami when developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "In both our youths, we went through the process of understanding one another's way of approaching the concept, so this time I had absolutely no concerns for Yamaoka-san, who I know has spent so much time playing through the game to make iterations and worked hard to convey the unique atmosphere of the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While there's some menacing sound design that will be familiar with Silent Hill's Otherworld, the score regularly shifts in direction, from the adrenaline of rock during exhilarating chase and combat sequences to dreamlike and noirish soundscapes in between missions. That there's also two original Cantopop songs adds to the feeling of being immersed in a Wong Kar Wai film.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Put together, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slitterhead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a radically different creation, showing that while Toyama may be returning to horror, he's not just content with doing what's expected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Toyama reminds us that through his past works, he's always been consistent when it comes to having a desire and approach to create something unique and unfamiliar. He concludes, "While I do strongly hope that many people can have a chance to play Slitterhead, I hope that people familiar with my work will be able to resonate with that same, distinctive atmosphere we try to convey."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
